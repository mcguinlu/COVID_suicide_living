0,Paired SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutations Observed During Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 Viral Transfer from Humans to Minks and Back to Humans,"A mutation analysis of a collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes around the world via sequence, date, geographic location, and species has revealed a large number of variants from the initial reference sequence in Wuhan. It also reveals that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have infected mink populations in the Netherlands, Denmark, United States, and Canada. In these animals, a small set of mutations often in combination, in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) has apparently transferred back into humans. The viral genomic mutations in minks observed in the Netherlands and Denmark show the potential for new mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD to be introduced into humans by zoonotic transfer. Our data suggests that close attention to viral transfer from humans to farm animals and pets will be required to prevent build-up of a viral reservoir for future zoonotic transfer.",Reid Rubsamen; Scott Burkholz; Suman Pokhrel; Benjamin R Kraemer; Daria Mochly-Rosen; Richard T Carback III; Tom Hodge; Paul Harris; Serban Ciotlos; Lu Wang; CV Herst,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424003,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424003,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
1,Deep mining of early antibody response in COVID-19 patients yields potent neutralisers and reveals high level of convergence,"Passive immunisation using monoclonal antibodies will play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Until now, the majority of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery efforts have relied on screening B cells of patients in the convalescent phase. Here, we describe deep-mining of the antibody repertoires of hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a combination of phage display technology and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing to isolate neutralising antibodies and gain insights into the early antibody response. This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded potent neutralising antibodies with distinct mechanisms of action, including the identification of a novel non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody that is not expected to be affected by any of the major viral variants reported. The study highlighted the presence of potent neutralising antibodies with near germline sequences within both the IgG and IgM pools at early stages of infection. Furthermore, we highlight a highly convergent antibody response with the same sequences occurring both within this study group and also within the responses described in previously published anti-SARS-CoV-2 studies.",Georgia Bullen; Jacob D Galson; Pedro Villar; Lien Moreels; Line Ledsgaard; Giada Mattiuzzo; Gareth Hall; Emma M Bentley; Edward W Masters; David Tang; Sophie Millett; Danielle Tongue; Richard Brown; Ioannis Diamantopoulos; Kothai Parthiban; Claire Tebbutt; Rachael Leah; Krishna Chaitanya; Deividas Pazeraitis; Sachin B Surade; Omodele Ashiru; Lucia Crippa; Richard Cowan; Matthew W Bowler; Jamie I Campbell; Wing-Yiu Jason Lee; Mark D Carr; David Matthews; Paul Pfeffer; Simon E Hufton; Kovilen Sawmynaden; Jane Osbourn; John McCafferty; Aneesh Karatt-Vellatt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424711,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424711,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
2,Defective NETs Clearance contributes to sustained FXII Activation in COVID-19-associated Pulmonary Thrombo-Inflammation,"Coagulopathy and inflammation are hallmarks of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with increased mortality. The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Here, we report a role of the NETs/ Factor XII (FXII) axis for initiating procoagulant and proinflammatory reactions in COVID-19. Proteomic analysis revealed enrichment of FXII in postmortem lung tissue from COVID-19 patients. Immunofluorescence analysis of COVID-19 lung tissue showed that FXII is activated in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vessel walls and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces. In particular, activated FXII (FXIIa) colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue, indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially caused by impaired NETs clearance via extracellular DNases. In contrast, addition of DNase I improved NETs clearance and reduced FXII activation in vitro. We propose that targeting both, FXIIa and the FXII activator NETs, is therapeutically effective in mitigating thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19.",Maike Frye; Hanna Englert; Chandini Rangaswamy; Carsten Deppermann; Jan-Peter Sperhake; Christoph Krisp; Danny Schreier; Emma Gordon; Sandra Konrath; Munif Haddad; Giordano Pula; Reiner Mailer; Hartmut Schlueter; Florian Langer; Klaus Pueschel; Kosta Panousis; Evi Stavrou; Coen Maas; Thomas Renne,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424644,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424644,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
3,Host Specific SARS-CoV-2 Mutations: Insertion of the Phenylalanine in the NSP6 Linked to the United Kingdome and Premature Termination of the ORF-8 Associated with the European and the United States of America Derived Samples.,"The coronavirus belongs to the order Nidovirales, which is known for the longest RNA genome virus. The polymerase enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 has proofreading functions, but still, the RNA viruses have a higher mutation rate than DNA viruses. The mutations in the viral genome provide a replication advantage in any population/geographical location and that may have profound consequences in the outcome and pathogenesis, diagnosis and patient management of the viral infection. In the present study, we have analysed full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, derived from symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients from all six continents to investigate the common mutations globally. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating independently, we identified total 313 mutations and some (21 mutations) of them are prevailing over time irrespective of geographical location. Another important finding, we are reporting here is, the mutation rate of the virus varies in different geographical locations suggesting the virus is adapting different strategies in the infected populations, having different genetic backgrounds across the globe. We have identified 11085TTT insertion (insertion of the Phenylalanine in NSP6 at position 38) mutation, which is mainly linked to the UK derived SARS-CoV-2 samples, we have also discovered non-sense mutation in ORF-8 after 17 amino acid is linked to the European and the USA derived SARS-CoV-2 samples.",Mohammad Khalid; Yousef Al-ebini; David Murphy; Maryam Shoai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424530,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424530,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
4,Structural basis for broad coronavirus neutralization,"Three highly pathogenic {beta}-coronaviruses crossed the animal-to-human species barrier in the past two decades: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARSCoV-2 has infected more than 64 million people worldwide, claimed over 1.4 million lives and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, cross-reacting with eight {beta}-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting {beta}-coronaviruses, and broadly inhibiting entry of pseudotyped viruses from two coronavirus lineages. Cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography characterization reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery and indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with {beta}-coronaviruses from three lineages along with proof-of-concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination. This study unveils an unexpected target for next-generation structure-guided design of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.",David Veesler,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424482,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424482,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
5,SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved s2m element dimerizes via a kissing complex and interacts with host miRNA-1307-3p,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle. The causative agent of the disease, SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival. Contained within the untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are believed to function in RNA replication, viral protein translation, and discontinuous transcription. While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the 3- UTR is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families. In this study, we demonstrate that the s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host cellular miRNA-1307-3p. Taken together, our results highlight the potential significance of the dimer structures formed by the s2m element in key biological processes and implicate the motif as a possible therapeutic drug target for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.",Joshua A.

6,Design of Specific Primer Set for Detection of B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 Variant using Deep Learning,"The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 lineage, also known as clade GR from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), Nextstrain clade 20B, or Variant Under Investigation in December 2020 (VUI - 202012/01), appears to have an increased transmissability in comparison to other variants. Thus, to contain and study this variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is necessary to develop a specific molecular test to uniquely identify it. Using a completely automated pipeline involving deep learning techniques, we designed a primer set which is specific to SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 with >99% accuracy, starting from 8,923 sequences from GISAID. The resulting primer set is in the region of the synonymous mutation C16176T in the ORF1ab gene, using the canonical sequence of the variant B.1.1.7 as a reference. Further in-silico testing shows that the primer set's sequences do not appear in different viruses, using 20,571 virus samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), nor in other coronaviruses, using 487 samples from National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). In conclusion, the presented primer set can be exploited as part of a multiplexed approach in the initial diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, or used as a second step of diagnosis in cases already positive to Covid-19, to identify individuals carrying the B.1.1.7 variant.",Alejandro Lopez-Rincon; Carmina Perez-Romero; Alberto Tonda; Lucero Mendoza-Maldonado; Eric Claassen; Johan Garssen; Aletta D.

7,Non-covalent TMPRSS2 inhibitors identified from virtual screening,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted researchers to pivot their efforts to finding anti-viral compounds and vaccines. In this study, we focused on the human host cell transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which plays an important role in the viral life cycle by cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. TMPRSS2 is an attractive target and has received significant attention for the development of drugs against SARS and MERS. Starting with comparative structural modeling and binding model analysis, we developed an efficient pharmacophore-based approach and applied in a large-scale in silico database screening for small molecule inhibitors against TMPRSS2. A number of novel inhibitors were identified, providing starting points for further development of drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.",Xin Hu; Jonathan H Shrimp; Hui Guo; Alexey V.

8,LinearSampling: Linear-Time Stochastic Sampling of RNA Secondary Structure with Applications to SARS-CoV-2,"Many RNAs fold into multiple structures at equilibrium. The classical stochastic sampling algorithm can sample secondary structures according to their probabilities in the Boltzmann ensemble, and is widely used, e.g., for accessibility prediction. However, the current sampling algorithm, consisting of a bottom-up partition function phase followed by a top-down sampling phase, suffers from three limitations: (a) the formulation and implementation of the sampling phase are unnecessarily complicated; (b) much redundant work is repeatedly performed in the sampling phase; (c) the partition function runtime scales cubically with the sequence length. These issues prevent it from being used for full-length viral genomes such as SARS-CoV-2. To address these problems, we first present a hypergraph framework under which the sampling algorithm can be greatly simplified. We then present three sampling algorithms under this framework of which two eliminate redundant work in the sampling phase. Finally, we present LinearSampling, an end-to-end linear-time sampling algorithm that is orders of magnitude faster than the standard algorithm. For instance, LinearSampling is 111 times faster (48s vs. 1.5h) than Vienna RNAsubopt on the longest sequence in the RNAcentral dataset that RNAsubopt can run (15,780 nt). More importantly, LinearSampling is the first sampling algorithm to scale to the full genome of SARS-CoV-2, taking only 96 seconds on its reference sequence (29,903 nt). It finds 23 regions of 15 nt with high accessibilities, which can be potentially used for COVID-19 diagnostics and drug design.",He Zhang; Liang Zhang; Sizhen Li; David Mathews; Liang Huang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424617,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424617,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
9,Environmental Dependence of the Structure of the C-terminal Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Envelope Protein,"The SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E) is involved in a broad spectrum of functions in the cycle of the virus, including assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. To enable these activities, E is likely to be capable of changing its conformation depending on environmental cues. To investigate this issue, here we characterised the structural properties of the C-terminal domain of E (E-CTD), which has been reported to interact with host cell membranes. We first studied the conformation of the E-CTD in solution, finding characteristic features of a disordered protein. By contrast, in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles and micelles, which mimic cell membranes, the E-CTD was observed to become structured. The E-CTD was also found to display conformational changes with osmolytes. Furthermore, prolonged incubation of the E-CTD under physiological conditions resulted in amyloid-like fibril formation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the E-CTD can change its conformation depending on its environment, ranging from a disordered state, to a membrane-bound folded state, and an amyloid state. Our results thus provide insight into the structural basis of the role of E in the viral infection process.",Kundlik Gadhave; Ankur Kumar; Prateek Kumar; Shivani K Kapuganti; Neha Garg; Michele Vendruscolo; Rajanish Giri,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424646,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424646,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
10,Rapid expression of COVID-19 proteins by transient expression in tobacco.,"In 2020 we suffered from a major global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Efforts to contain the virus include the development of rapid tests and vaccines, which require a ready supply of viral proteins. Here we report the production of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins by transient transformation of tobacco, leading to high expression within three days, and subsequent purification of the intact proteins. Such efforts may help to develop testing resources to alleviate the major impacts of this global pandemic.",Penelope L Lindsay; Amanda Ackerman; Yinan Jian; Oliver Artz; Daniele Rosado; Tara Skopelitis; Munenori Kitagawa; Ullas V Pedmale; David Jackson,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424712,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424712,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
11,SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 induces neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic. In addition to respiratory complications as a result of SARS-CoV-2 illness, accumulating evidence suggests that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with the disease caused by the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and iNOS/NO. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 increased protein expressions of phospho-p65 and phospho-I{kappa}B, as well as enhancing DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-{kappa}B. Pro-inflammatory effects of the glycoprotein effects were reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 M). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 in BV-2 microglia increased the protein expression of NLRP3, as well as caspase-1 activity. However, pre-treatment with CRID3 (1 M) or BAY11-7082 (1 M) resulted in the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1. It was also observed that CRID3 attenuated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increase in IL-1{beta} production. Increased protein expression of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike glycoprotein S1, and was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that promotion of neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein is mediated through activation of NF-{kappa}B, NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 MAPK. These results are significant because of their relevance to our understanding of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",Olumayokun A Olajide; Victoria U Iwuanyanwu; Oyinkansola D Adegbola,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424619,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424619,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
12,Landscapes and dynamic diversifications of B-cell receptor repertoires in COVID-19 patients,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Great international efforts have been put into the development of prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. However,the knowledge about the B cell immune response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still limited. Here,we report a comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of immunoglobin heavy chain (IGH) repertoire in COVID-19 patients. By using next-generation sequencing technology, we examined the temporal changes in the landscape of the patient's immunological status, and found dramatic changes in the IGH within the patient's immune system after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Although different patients have distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, by employing clonotype overlap, lineage expansion and clonotype network analyses, we observed a higher clonotype overlap and substantial lineage expansion of B cell clones during 2-3 weeks of illness, which is of great importance to B-cell immune responses. Meanwhile, for preferences of V gene usage during SARS-CoV-2 infection, IGHV3-74 and IGHV4-34 and IGHV4-39 in COVID-19 patients were more abundant than that of healthy controls. Overall, we present an immunological resource for SARS-CoV-2 that could promote both therapeutic development as well as mechanistic research.",Haitao Xiang; Yingze Zhao; Xinyang Li; Peipei Liu; Longlong Wang; Meiniang Wang; Lei Tian; Haixi Sun; Wei Zhang; Ziqian Xu; Beiwei Ye; Xiaoju Yuan; Pengyan Wang; Ning Zhang; Yuhuan Gong; Chengrong Bian; Zhaohai Wang; Linxiang Yu; Jin Yan; Fanping Meng; Changqing Bai; Xiaoshan Wang; Xiaopan Liu; Kai Gao; Liang Wu; Longqi F.

13,ACE2 peptide fragment interacts with several sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1,"The influence of the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ on the kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was studied to model the interaction of the virus with its host cell. This peptide corresponds to the sequence 24-42 of the ACE2 1 domain, which is the binding site for the S1 protein. The on-rate and off-rate of S1-ACE2 complex formation were measured in the presence of various peptide concentrations using Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). The formation of the S1-ACE2 complex was inhibited when the S1 protein was preincubated with the peptide, however, no significant inhibitory effect was observed in the absence of preincubation. Dissociation kinetics revealed that the peptide remained bound to the S1-ACE2 complex and stabilized this complex. Computational mapping of the S1 protein surface for peptide binding revealed two additional sites, located at some distance from the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1. These additional binding sites affect the interaction between the peptide, the S1 protein, and ACE2.",Aleksei Kuznetsov; Piret Arukuusk; Heleri Härk; Erkki Juronen; Ülo Langel; Mart Ustav; Jaak Järv,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424682,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424682,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
14,Structural dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot reveal topologically distinct conformers,"The RNA pseudoknot that stimulates -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a possible drug target. To understand how this 3-stemmed pseudoknot responds to the mechanical tension applied by ribosomes during translation, which is thought to play a key role during frameshifting, we probed its structural dynamics under tension using optical tweezers. Unfolding curves revealed that the frameshift signal formed multiple different structures: at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformers with different unfolding forces and energy barriers, as well as alternative stem-loop structures. Refolding curves showed that stem 1 formed first in the pseudoknotted conformers, followed by stem 3 and then stem 2. By extending the handle holding the RNA to occlude the 5' end of stem 1, the proportion of the different pseudoknot conformers could be altered systematically, consistent with structures observed in cryo-EM images and computational simulations that had distinct topologies: the 5' end of the RNA threaded through the 3-helix junction to form a ring-knot, or unthreaded as in more standard H-type pseudoknots. These results resolve the folding mechanism of the frameshift signal in SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the dynamic conformational heterogeneity of this RNA, with important implications for structure-based drug-discovery efforts.",Krishna Neupane; Meng Zhao; Aaron Lyons; Sneha Munshi; Sandaru M Ileperuma; Dustin B Ritchie; Noel Q Hoffer; Abhishek Narayan; Michael T Woodside,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424630,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424630,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
15,Lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enables analysis of neutralizing activity in COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread around the globe, effective vaccination protocols are under deployment. Alternatively, the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy relies on the transfer of the immunoglobulin repertoire of a donor that has recovered from the disease as a means of passive vaccination. While the lack of an effective antiviral treatment inadvertently increases the interest in CP products, initial clinical evaluation on COVID-19 patients revealed that critical factors determining the outcome of CP therapy need to be defined clearly if clinical efficacy is to be expected. Measurement of neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 using live virus presents a reliable functional assay but the availability of suitable BSL3 facilities for live virus culture restricts its applicability. Instead, the use of pseudovirus particles containing elements from the SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely applied to determine the activity of CP or other neutralizing agents such as monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we present our approach to optimize GFP-encoding lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Membrane proteins for use in neutralization assays. Our results show the feasibility of pseudovirus production using a C-terminal truncated Spike protein which is greatly enhanced by the incorporation of the D614G mutation. Moreover, we report that the use of sodium butyrate during lentiviral vector production dramatically increases pseudovirus titers. Analysis of CP neutralizing activity against particles pseudotyped with wildtype or D614G mutant Spike protein in the presence or absence the M protein revealed differential activity in CP samples that did not necessarily correlate with the amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our results indicate that the extent of neutralizing activity in CP samples depends on the quality rather than the quantity of the humoral immune responses and varies greatly between donors. Functional screening of neutralizing activity using pseudovirus-based neutralization assays must be accepted as a critical tool for choosing CP donors if clinical efficacy is to be maximized.",Cevriye Pamukcu; Elif Celik; Ebru Zeynep Ergun; Zeynep Sena Karahan; Gozde Turkoz; Merkaya Aras; Canan Eren; Uluhan Sili; Huseyin Bilginer; Ilke Suder; Baris Can Mandaci; Baran Dingiloglu; Ozge Tatli; Gizem Dinler Doganay; Safa Baris; Nesrin Ozoren; Tolga Sutlu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424590,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424590,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
16,An Ultrasensitive Biosensor for Quantifying the Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and Its Receptor ACE2 in Cells and in vitro,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading and mutating with increasing speed worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a simple, sensitive, and high-throughput (HTP) assay to quantify virus-host interaction in order to quickly evaluate infectious ability of mutant virus and develop or validate virus-inhibiting drugs. Here we have developed an ultrasensitive bioluminescent biosensor to evaluate virus-cell interaction by quantifying the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) both in living cells and in vitro. We have successfully used this novel biosensor to analyze SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants, and evaluated candidate small molecules (SMs), antibodies, and peptides that may block RBD:ACE2 interaction. This simple, rapid and HTP biosensor tool will significantly expedite detection of viral mutants and anti-COVID-19 drug discovery processes.",Lidong Liu; Yee Wah So; Yutian Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424698,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424698,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
17,Maori and Pacific People in New Zealand have higher risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19,"AimsWe aim to quantify differences in clinical outcomes from COVID-19 infection by ethnicity with a focus on risk of hospitalisation.

MethodsWe used data on age, ethnicity, deprivation index, pre-existing health conditions, and clinical outcomes on 1,829 COVID-19 cases reported in New Zealand. We used a logistic regression model to calculate odds ratios for the risk of hospitalisation by ethnicity. We also consider length of hospital stay and risk of fatality.

ResultsM[a]ori have 2.5 times greater odds of hospitalisation than non-M[a]ori, non-Pacific people, after controlling for age and pre-existing conditions. Similarly, Pacific people have 3 times greater odds.

ConclusionsStructural inequities and systemic racism in the healthcare system mean that M[a]ori and Pacific communities face a much greater health burden from COVID-19. Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions are also at greater risk.

18,Can age-distribution be an indicator of the goodness of COVID-19 testing?,"It has been evident that the faster, more accurate, and more comprehensive testing can help policymakers assess the real impact of COVID-19 and help them with when and how strict the mitigation policies should be. Nevertheless, the exact number of infected ones could not be measured due to the lack of comprehensive testing. In this paper, first of all, we will investigate the relation of transmission of COVID-19 with age by observing timed data in multiple countries. Then, we compare the COVID-19 CFR with the age-demography data. and as a result, we have proposed a method for estimating a lower bound for the number of positive cases by using the reported data on the oldest age group and the regions population age-distributions. The proposed estimation method improved the expected similarity between the age-distribution of positive cases and regions populations. Thus, using the publicly accessible data for several developed countries, we show how the improvement of testing over the course of several months has made it clear for the community that different age groups are equally prone to becoming COVID positive. The result shows that the age demography of COVID-19 gets similar to the age-demography of the population, together with the reduction of CFR over time. In addition, countries with less CFR have more similar COVID-19s age-distribution, which is caused by more comprehensive testing, than ones who have higher CFR. This leads us to a better estimation for positive cases in different testing strategies.

19,MHC-II constrains the natural neutralizing antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBM in humans,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies develop within two weeks of infection, but wane relatively rapidly post-infection, raising concerns about whether antibody responses will provide protection upon re-exposure. Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.

20,Emerging SARS-CoV-2 diversity revealed by rapid whole genome sequence typing.,"BackgroundDiscrete classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral genotypes can identify emerging strains and detect geographic spread, viral diversity, and transmission events.

MethodsWe developed a tool (GNUVID) that integrates whole genome multilocus sequence typing and a supervised machine learning random forest-based classifier. We used GNUVID to assign sequence type (ST) profiles to each of 69,686 SARS-CoV-2 complete, high-quality genomes available from GISAID as of October 20th 2020. STs were then clustered into clonal complexes (CCs), and then used to train a machine learning classifier. We used this tool to detect potential introduction and exportation events, and to estimate effective viral diversity across locations and over time in 16 US states.

ResultsGNUVID is a scalable tool for viral genotype classification (available at https://github.com/ahmedmagds/GNUVID) that can be used to quickly process tens of thousands of genomes. Our genotyping ST/CC analysis uncovered dynamic local changes in ST/CC prevalence and diversity with multiple replacement events in different states. We detected an average of 20.6 putative introductions and 7.5 exportations for each state. Effective viral diversity dropped in all states as shelter-in-place travel-restrictions went into effect and increased as restrictions were lifted. Interestingly, our analysis showed correlation between effective diversity and the date that state-wide mask mandates were imposed.

ConclusionsOur classification tool uncovered multiple introduction and exportation events, as well as waves of expansion and replacement of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in different states. Combined with future genomic sampling the GNUVID system could be used to track circulating viral diversity and identify emerging clones and hotspots.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424582,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424582,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
21,Losartan promotes cell survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be associated with mortality and high morbidity worldwide. There is an extensive effort to control infection and disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study addressed the hypothesis that angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, Losartan, may restrict pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2 by decreasing viral-induced cytopathological changes by blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), thus reducing the affinity of the virus for ACE2, and inhibiting papain-like protease of the virus.

MethodLosartan inhibitory effect on deubiquitination and deISGylation properties of papain-like protease was investigated using a fluorescence method and gel shift analysis determining its inhibitory effects.

The inhibitory effect of Losartan on SARS-CoV-2 cell replication was investigated both when losartan was added to the cell culture 1 hour before (pre-infection group) and 1 hour after (post-infection group) SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells.

ResultsLosartan treatment of Vero E6 cells prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication by 80% and 70% respectively. Losartan was not a strong deubiquitinase and deISGylase inhibitor of PLpro.

ConclusionLosartan added pre- and post-infection to the Vero E6 cell culture significantly prevents cell destruction and replication by SARS-CoV2. Losartan has low side-effects, is readily available, and can be produced at high levels globally, all features of a promising drug in treatment of COVID-19 if validated by clinical trials.",Reza Nejat; Ahmad Shahir Sadr; Brendan T.

22,Human neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 require intact Fc effector functions and monocytes for optimal therapeutic protection,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although passively delivered neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show promise in clinical trials, their mechanism of action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we define correlates of protection of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes for therapeutic efficacy. Thus, potently neutralizing mAbs require Fc effector functions for maximal therapeutic benefit during therapy to modulate protective immune responses and mitigate lung disease.",Emma S.

23,SARS-CoV-2 escape in vitro from a highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"To investigate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the immune population, we co-incubated authentic virus with a highly neutralizing plasma from a COVID-19 convalescent patient. The plasma fully neutralized the virus for 7 passages, but after 45 days, the deletion of F140 in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) N3 loop led to partial breakthrough. At day 73, an E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) occurred, followed at day 80 by an insertion in the NTD N5 loop containing a new glycan sequon, which generated a variant completely resistant to plasma neutralization. Computational modeling predicts that the deletion and insertion in loops N3 and N5 prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies. The recent emergence in the United Kingdom and South Africa of natural variants with similar changes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to escape an effective immune response and that vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants should be developed.

24,SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and transmission efficiency is increased for airborne but not fomite exposure in Syrian hamsters,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by contact, fomite, and airborne transmission. The relative contribution of different transmission routes remains subject to debate. Here, we show Syrian hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through intranasal, aerosol and fomite exposure. Different routes of exposure presented with distinct disease manifestations. Intranasal and aerosol inoculation caused more severe respiratory pathology, higher virus loads and increased weight loss. Fomite exposure led to milder disease manifestation characterized by an anti-inflammatory immune state and delayed shedding pattern. Whereas the overall magnitude of respiratory virus shedding was not linked to disease severity, the onset of shedding was. Early shedding was linked to an increase in disease severity. Airborne transmission was more efficient than fomite transmission and dependent on the direction of the airflow. Carefully characterized of SARS-CoV-2 transmission models will be crucial to assess potential changes in transmission and pathogenic potential in the light of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",Julia R Port; Claude Kwe Yinda; Irene Offei Owusu; Myndi Holbrook; Robert J Fischer; Trenton J Bushmaker; Victoria A Avanzato; Jonathan E Schulz; Neeltje van Doremalen; Chad Clancy; Vincent Munster,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424565,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424565,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
25,SPINT2 controls SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and is associated to disease severity,"COVID-19 outbreak is the biggest threat to human health in recent history. Currently, there are over 1.5 million related deaths and 75 million people infected around the world (as of 22/12/2020). The identification of virulence factors which determine disease susceptibility and severity in different cell types remains an essential challenge. The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. SPINT2 is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between SPINT2/TMPRSS2 and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that SPINT2 negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after SPINT2 knockdown. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases.",Carlos Ramirez; Ashwini Kumar Sharma; Carmon Kee; Leonie Thomas; Steeve Boulant; Carl Herrmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424029,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424029,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
26,Analysis and Forecasting of Global of RT-PCR Primers for SARS-CoV-2,"Rapid tests for active SARS-CoV-2 infections rely on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR uses reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA (primer and probe) targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The technology makes rapid and specific identification of the virus possible based on sequence homology of nucleic acid sequence and is much faster than than tissue culture or animal cell models. However the technique can lose sensitivity over time as the virus evolves and the target sequences diverge from the selective primer sequences. As we rely on existing RT-PCR primers to track and manage the spread of the Coronavirus as public life re-opens, it is imperative to understand how SARS-CoV-2 mutations, over time and geographically, diverge from existing primers used today. In this study, we analyze the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 primers in use today by measuring the number of mismatches between primer sequence and genome targets over time and spatially. We find that there is a growing number of mismatches, an increase by 2% per month, as well as a high specificity of virus based on geographic location.",Gowri Nayar; Ed Seabolt; Mark Kunitomi; Akshay Agarwal; Kristen L.

27,Rapid inactivation in vitro of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva by black tea and green tea,"Saliva plays major roles in human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Recently we reported that black, green and oolong tea significantly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 1 min. Theaflavin-3,3-di-gallate (TFDG), theasinensin A (TSA) and (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were involved in the anti-viral activities. Here we examined how long period is required for the compounds to inactivate the virus. We also assessed whether tea inactivates SARS-CoV-2 diluted in human saliva. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with 500 M TFDG or TSA for 10 sec reduced the virus titer to undetectable levels (less than 1/1,000). Black and green tea decreased virus titer to less than 1/100 within 10 sec even in saliva. These findings suggest a possibility that intake of, or gargling with, tea may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in saliva in infected individuals, which may eventually attenuate spread of COVID-19 within a population, although clinical studies are required to test this hypothesis by determining the intensity and duration of the anti-viral effect of tea in saliva in humans.",Eriko Ohgitani; Masaharu Shin-Ya; Masaki Ichitani; Makoto Kobayashi; Takanobu Takihara; Masaya Kawamoto; Hitoshi Kinugasa; Osam Mazda,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424533,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424533,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
28,Quantifying the online news media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, mask wearing and social distancing have been the primary measures to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is strong population wide adherence which needs to be facilitated by information on the current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. Here we address the issue of communication on the pandemic by offering data and analysis of online news media coverage of COVID-19.

MethodsWe collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available at http://sciride.org). Using topic detection we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage pandemic received in 2020. Sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 articles to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations.

FindingsWe find that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-speaking sources reveals that the overall COVID-19 coverage cannot be simply classified as negative due to the disease subject matter, suggesting a wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-speaking articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear or crisis.

InterpretationThe goal of pandemic public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and maximize the impact of any governmental policy. Our results suggest an information overload in COVID-19 reporting that could risk obscuring effective policy communication.

29,S-variant SARS-CoV-2 is associated with significantly higher viral loads in samples tested by ThermoFisher TaqPath RT-PCR,"Birmingham University Turnkey laboratory is part of the Lighthouse network responsible for testing clinical samples under the UK government  Test & Trace scheme. Samples are analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples using the Thermofisher TaqPath RT-QPCR test, which is designed to co-amplify sections of three SARS-CoV-2 viral genes.

Since more recent information became available regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (S-VoC), which can show a suboptimal profile in RT-QPCR tests such as the ThermoFisher TaqPath used at the majority of Lighthouse laboratories, we analysed recently published data for trends and significance of the S-gene  dropout variant.

Results showed that:

O_LIthe population of S-gene dropout samples had significantly lower median Ct values of ORF and N-gene targets compared to samples where S-gene was detected
C_LIO_LIon a population basis, S-gene dropout samples clustered around very low Ct values for ORF and N targets
C_LIO_LIlinked Ct values for individual samples showed that a low Ct for ORF and N were clearly associated with an S-dropout characteristic
C_LIO_LIwhen conservatively inferring relative viral load from Ct values, approximately 35% of S-dropout samples had high viral loads between 10 and 10,000-fold greater than 1 x 106, compared to 10% of S-positive samples.

30,Salivary SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection: a prospective cohort study,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 quick testing and reporting are now considered relevant for the containment of new pandemic waves. Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful. We compared the diagnostic performance of salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care (POC) immunochromatographic assays, with that of molecular testing.

Methods234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.

ResultsThe overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the first week from symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing between positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC=0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva had an overall good accuracy (ROC-AUC=0.805, 95%CI:0.740-0.870), reaching the optimal value within 7 days from symptom onset (Sensitivity: 72%; Specificity: 97%). POC antigen in saliva had a very limited sensitivity (13%), performing better in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively), depending on viral loads.

ConclusionsSelf-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection not only by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, for which the highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved in the first week from symptom onset. Saliva is not suitable for POC, although the accuracy of these tests appears satisfactory for NPS with high viral load.",Daniela Basso; Ada Aita; Andrea Padoan; Chiara Cosma; Filippo Navaglia; Stefania Moz; Nicole Contran; Carlo-Federico Zambon; Anna Maria Cattelan; Mario Plebani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248825,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248825,2020-12-27,2020-12-27,,True

However, the role of nasal bacteria in the induction of the virus-specific adaptive immunity is less clear. Here we demonstrate that while intranasal administration of influenza virus hemagglutinin vaccine alone was insufficient to induce the vaccine-specific antibody responses, disruption of nasal bacteria by lysozyme or addition of culturable oral bacteria from a healthy human volunteer rescued inability of the nasal bacteria to generate antibody responses to intranasally administered the split-virus vaccine. Myd88-depdnent signaling in the hematopoietic compartment was required for adjuvant activity of intranasally administered oral bacteria. In addition, we found that the oral bacteria-combined intranasal vaccine induced protective antibody response to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

32,SARS-CoV-2 mutations among minks show reduced lethality and infectivity to humans,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks has become a serious problem, as the virus may mutate and reinfect humans; some countries have decided to cull minks. Here, the virus sequencing data in minks were analysed and compared to those of human-virus. Although the mink-virus maintained the characteristics of human-virus, some variants rapidly mutated, adapting to minks. Some mink-derived variants infected humans, which accounted for 40% of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases in the Netherlands. These variants appear to be less lethal and infective compared to those in humans. Variants that have mutated further among minks were not found in humans.

33,The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein recognition by the human 14-3-3 proteins,"The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) controls viral genome packaging and contains numerous phosphorylation sites located within unstructured regions. Phosphorylated SARS-CoV N was shown to bind to the host 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm. Proteomic data indicate that seven human 14-3-3 proteins are highly abundant in human tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, collectively reaching ~1.8% of all proteins in the lungs, ~1.4% in the gastrointestinal system, ~2.3% in the nervous system. Although the association between 14-3-3 and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins can represent one of the key host-pathogen interactions, its mechanism and the specific critical phosphosites were unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N protein (pN) dimers, reconstituted via bacterial co-expression with protein kinase A, directly associate, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with the dimeric 14-3-3 protein hub, but not with its monomeric mutant. We demonstrate that pN is recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with various efficiencies and determine the apparent KD to selected isoforms in a low micromolar range. Serial truncations pinpointed a critical phosphorylation site to Ser197, located within the SR-rich region of N. The tight 14-3-3/pN association suggests it could regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N, while hijacking cellular pathways by 14-3-3 sequestration. As such, the assembly may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.",Kristina V Tugaeva; Dorothy E. D. P. Hawkins; Jake L. R.

34,The neutralization effect of Montelukast on SARS-CoV-2 is shown by multiscale in silico simulations and combined in vitro studies,"Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 M concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.",Serdar Durdagi; Timucin Avsar; Muge Didem Orhan; Muge Serhatli; Bertan Koray Balcioglu; Hasan Umit Ozturk; Alisan Kayabolen; Yuksel Cetin; Seyma Aydinlik; Tugba Bagci-Onder; Saban Tekin; Hasan Demirci; Mustafa Guzel; Atilla Akdemir; Seyma Calis; Lalehan Oktay; Ilayda Tolu; Yasar Enes Butun; Ece Erdemoglu; Alpsu Olkan; Nurettin Tokay; Seyma Isik; Aysenur Ozcan; Elif Acar; Sehriban Buyukkilic; Yesim Yumak,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424423,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424423,2020-12-27,2020-12-27,,False
35,"Genomic characterization of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","In this study, we report the sequencing of 180 new viral genomes obtained from different municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro from April to December 2020. We identified a novel lineage of SARS-CoV-2, originated from B.1.1.28, distinguished by five single-nucleotide variants (SNVs): C100U, C28253U, G28628U, G28975U, and C29754U. The SNV G23012A (E484K), in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein, was widely spread across the samples. This mutation was previously associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This novel lineage emerged in late July being first detected by us in late October and still mainly restricted to the capital of the state. However, as observed for other strains it can be rapidly spread in the state. The significant increase in the frequency of this lineage raises concerns about public health management and continuous need for genomic surveillance during the second wave of infections.

36,Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Testing for Rapid Diagnosis of COVID-19 during the Initial Stages of a Global Pandemic,"Accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is essential to guide prevention and control of COVID-19. From January 11 - April 22, 2020, Public Health Ontario conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing of 86,942 specimens collected from 80,354 individuals, primarily using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods. We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple same-day and multi-day collected specimens. Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 Ct lower (SE=0.5, p<0.001). Same-day specimens showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median Ct of multi-day specimens increased over time. Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 Ct (SE=0.5, p<0.001) lower than asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases. Overall test sensitivity was 84.6%, with a negative predictive value of 95.5%.

37,Mechanical ventilation affects respiratory microbiome of COVID-19 patients and its interactions with the host,"Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence suggests that the microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n=58) and lower (n=35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We found that time in the intensive care unit and the type of oxygen support explained the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, dwarfing (non-significant) effects from viral load, disease severity, and immune status. Specifically, mechanical ventilation was linked to altered community structure, lower species- and higher strain-level diversity, and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients identified increased oral microbiota compared to controls. These oral microbiota were found physically associated with proinflammatory immune cells, which showed higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.",Verónica Lloréns-Rico; Ann C.

38,Changes in inflammatory and immune drivers in response to immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19,"As the global community strives to discover effective therapies for COVID-19, immunomodulatory strategies have emerged as a leading contender to combat the cytokine storm and improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe disease. Systemic corticosteroids and selective cytokine inhibitory agents have been utilized both as empiric therapies and in clinical trials. While multiple randomized, placebo controlled trials have now demonstrated that corticosteroids improve survival in patients with COVID-19,1, 2 IL-6 inhibition, which gained significant early interest based on observational studies, has not demonstrated reliable efficacy in randomized, placebo controlled trials.3, 4 To better understand the mechanistic basis of immunomodulatory therapies being implemented for treatment of COVID-19, we assessed longitudinal biochemical changes in response to such approaches in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We demonstrate broad suppression of multiple immunomodulatory factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 in patients who received corticosteroids, but no such response was seen in patients who either received tocilizumab or no immunomodulatory therapy. Our findings provide early insights into molecular signatures that correlate with immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19 which may be useful in understanding clinical outcomes in future studies of larger patient cohorts.",Stephen Y Wang; C-Hong Chang; Matthew Meizlish; Parveen Bahel; Henry Rinder; Alfred I Lee; Hyung Chun,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248547,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248547,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
39,"Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during 9-months of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden","Structured abstractO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSAs Sweden did not enforce social lockdown in response to the pandemic, it is critical to establish seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy, active adults - here represented by blood donors and pregnant women. Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the countrys most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of population seropositivity in response to natural infection.

DesignIn this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n=2,100) and pregnant women (n=2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three intervals) between 14th March and 11th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large cohort of historical controls (n=595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807.

SettingHealthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through the Karolinska University Hospital.

ParticipantsNone of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the samples.

ResultsBlood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened (n=56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response.

ConclusionsIn agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2.

General abstractPublic health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world. In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n=4,100) were sampled at random between 14th March-11th December 2020. All individuals (n=200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results were compared with those from historical controls (n=595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9 months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the end of 2020.",Xaquin C Dopico; Sandra Muschiol; Murray Christian; Leo Hanke; Daniel J Sheward; Nastasiya F Grinberg; Gordana Bogdanovic; Gerald Mcinerney; Tobias Allander; Chris Wallace; Ben Murrell; Jan Albert; Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248821,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248821,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
40,MHC Haplotyping of SARS-CoV-2 patients: HLA subtypes are not associated with the presence and severity of Covid-19 in the Israeli population,"HLA haplotypes were found to be associated with increased risk for viral infections or disease severity in various diseases, including SARS. Several genetic variants are associated with Covid-19 severity. However, no clear association between HLA and Covid-19 incidence or severity has been reported. We conducted a large scale HLA analysis of Israeli individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Overall, 72,912 individuals with known HLA haplotypes were included in the study, of whom 6,413 (8.8%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. a Total of 20,937 subjects were of Ashkenazi origin (at least 2/4 grandparents). One hundred eighty-one patients (2.8% of the infected) were hospitalized due to the disease. None of the 66 most common HLA loci (within the five HLA subgroups; A, B, C, DQB1, DRB1) was found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization. Similarly, no association was detected in the Ashkenazi Jewish subset. Moreover, no association was found between heterozygosity in any of the HLA loci and either infection or hospitalization.

We conclude that HLA haplotypes are not a major risk/protecting factor among the Israeli population for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity.",shay Ben-shachar; Noam Barda; Sigal SM Manor; Sapir Israeli; Noa Dagan; Shai Carmi; Ran Balicer; Bracha Zisser; Yoram Louzoun,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248148,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248148,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
41,Does COVID-19 Testing Create More Cases? An Empirical Evidence on the Importance of Mass Testing During a Pandemic,"The importance of testing and surveillance of an infectious disease cannot be underestimated. The testing is the first step to detect an infectious disease, and mass testing can slow or mitigate the spread of an infectious disease. Despite overwhelming evidence and the importance of testing discussed in the literature, there have been claims that ""more COVID-19 testing creates more cases"". Therefore, there is a need to study whether massive testing is the reason for detecting more positive COVID-19 cases. In this research, we used a dataset from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and empirically showed that by increasing the COVID-19 testing in the U.S., the spread of the COVID-19 decreased significantly. Our results indicate a negative relationship between the number of positive cases and the number of tests performed in the past months. The large-scale testing may have helped identify positive and asymptomatic cases early in the course of illness, which enabled individuals to isolate themselves, thus reducing the chances of spreading the diseases and slowing the spread of the pandemic.",Ali Ahmed,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248740,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248740,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
42,Oral clarithromycin in COVID-19 of moderate severity: the ACHIEVE open-label trial using concurrent matched comparators,"BackgroundClarithromycin clinical efficacy has not been described in COVID-19.

Research questionIs oral clarithromycin beneficial for treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19?

Study and methodsAn open-label non-randomized trial in 90 patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity was conducted at four study sites in Greece between May and October 2020. Ninety participants with respiratory tract infections received clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours for 7 days; another 90 standard-of-care (SOC) propensity score-matched concurrent controls received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine. The composite primary endpoint was defined for patients with upper respiratory tract infection as: (a) no need for hospital re-admission or (b) lack of progression into lower respiratory tract infection and, for patients with lower respiratory tract infection, as at least 50% decrease of the score of respiratory symptoms at the end-of-treatment (EOT) without progression into severe respiratory failure (SRF). The incidence SRF at the test-of-cure (TOC) on day 14 was a secondary endpoint. For clarithromycin-treated patients, viral load of SARS-CoV-2, biomarkers, the function of mononuclear cells, and safety were assessed; biomarkers were also measured in SOC comparators.

ResultsThe primary endpoint was attained in 86.7% of patients treated with clarithromycin (95% CIs 78.1-92.2%) and 73.3% of concurrent SOC comparators (95%CIs; 63.4-81.4%). The odds ratio for the primary endpoint with clarithromycin treatment in univariate analysis was 2.36 (95%CIs 1.09-5.08; P: 0.039). Results were confirmed after multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 3.30; 95% CI 1.10-9.87; P: 0.033). At the TOC visit, the incidence of SRF was 12.2% (n = 11 ; 95%CIs 6.9-20.6%) among patients treated with clarithromycin (odds ratio for SRF 0.38; 95%CIs 0.17-0.84) versus 26.7% (n= 24; 95%CIs 18.6-36.6%) among concurrent SOC comparators (P: 0.023). Clarithromycin use was associated with decreases in circulating levels of C-reactive protein, of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and of interleukin (IL)-6; by an increase of the ratio of Th1 to Th2 mononuclear responses; and by suppression of SARS-CoV-2 relative viral load. No safety concerns were reported. Patients starting clarithromycin with the first five days from symptoms onset achieved better responses.

InterpretationClarithromycin treatment is associated with early clinical improvement in patients with moderate COVID-19. Modulation of the Th1/Th2 responses is proposed as the mechanism of action.

43,Association between Use of Qingfei Paidu Tang and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A national retrospective registry study,"BackgroundQingfei Paidu Tang (QPT), a formula of traditional Chinese medicine, which was suggested to be able to ease symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been recommended by clinical guidelines and widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, whether it decreases mortality remains unknown.

PurposeWe aimed to explore the association between QPT use and in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

Study designA retrospective study based on a real-world database was conducted.

MethodsWe identified patients consecutively hospitalized with COVID-19 in 15 hospitals from a national retrospective registry in China, from January through May 2020. Data on patients characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from the electronic medical records. The association of QPT use with mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models based on propensity score analysis.

ResultsOf the 8939 patients included, 28.7% received QPT. The crude mortality was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8% to 1.7%) among the patients receiving QPT and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3% to 5.3%) among those not receiving QPT. After adjustment for patient characteristics and concomitant treatments, QPT use was associated with a relative reduction of 50% in in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66 P <0.001). This association was consistent across subgroups by sex and age. Meanwhile, the incidence of acute liver injury (8.9% [95% CI, 7.8% to 10.1%]vs. 9.9% [95% CI, 9.2% to 10.7%]; odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.81% to 1.14%], P =0.658) and acute kidney injury (1.6% [95% CI, 1.2% to 2.2%] vs. 3.0% [95% CI, 2.6% to 3.5%]; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17], P =0.318) was comparable between patients receiving QPT and those not receiving QPT. The major study limitations included that the study was an observational study based on real-world data rather than a randomized control trial, and the quality of data could be affected by the accuracy and completeness of medical records.

ConclusionsQPT was associated with a substantially lower risk of in-hospital mortality, without extra risk of acute liver injury or acute kidney injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.",Lihua Zhang; Xin Zheng; Xueke Bai; Qing Wang; Bowang Chen; Haibo Wang; Jiapeng Lu; Shuang Hu; Xiaoyan Zhang; Haibo Zhang; Jiamin Liu; Ying Shi; Zhiye Zhou; Lanxia Gan; Xi Li; Jing Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248444,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248444,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True

45,Prognostic and predictive biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab in a randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundRetrospective observational studies suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, D-dimer, and platelets are associated with disease progression, treatment outcomes, or both, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We explored these candidate prognostic and predictive biomarkers with efficacy outcomes after treatment with tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody using data from the COVACTA trial for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

MethodsCandidate biomarkers were measured in 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 142 patients in the placebo arm. Efficacy outcomes assessed were clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharge; 7, death), mortality, time to hospital discharge, and mechanical ventilation (if not receiving it at randomisation) through day 28. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers were evaluated continuously with proportional odds, binomial or Fine-Gray models, and additional sensitivity analyses.

FindingsModelling in the placebo arm showed all candidate biomarkers except LDH and D-dimer were strongly prognostic for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical status, and time to hospital discharge. Modelling in the tocilizumab arm showed a predictive value of ferritin for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality (predictive interaction p=0.03), mechanical ventilation (predictive interaction p=0.01), and clinical status (predictive interaction p=0.02) compared with placebo.

InterpretationMultiple biomarkers prognostic for clinical outcomes were confirmed in COVACTA. Ferritin was identified as a predictive biomarker for the effects of tocilizumab in the COVACTA patient population; high ferritin levels were associated with better clinical outcomes for tocilizumab compared with placebo at day 28.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Evidence before this studyThe efficacy and safety of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in the treatment of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia was investigated in COVACTA, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint of improved clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death) at day 28 was not met in this trial. Among the secondary endpoints, no difference in mortality at day 28 was observed, but time to hospital discharge was shorter in the tocilizumab group. Subgroup analysis suggested there might be a treatment benefit in patients grouped according to their ordinal scale category at baseline.

We searched PubMed on September 14, 2020, using the terms ""tocilizumab AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus) AND biomarker"" with no language or date restrictions. The search retrieved 18 articles, four of which identified laboratory measures as potential biomarkers in patients who received tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. The biomarkers reported in these studies include interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, liver transaminases, lymphocytes, platelets, and D-dimer. However, these previous studies were single-centre, retrospective, observational studies. Larger, prospective, controlled trials are needed to investigate potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers to assess the outcomes and response to treatments for COVID-19.

Added value of this studyThis exploratory analysis of data from COVACTA demonstrated interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, neutrophils (percentage and absolute count), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocytes (percentage and absolute count), monocytes (percentage), and platelets as strong prognostic biomarkers in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. More important, ferritin showed predictive value for tocilizumab treatment effects on day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation (among the subgroup of patients not receiving mechanical ventilation at randomisation), and clinical status compared with placebo.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn patients with elevated levels of ferritin at baseline, tocilizumab decreased the probability of death, mechanical ventilation, and worsening clinical status at day 28 compared with placebo, suggesting that ferritin might be useful as a predictive biomarker of efficacy outcomes for tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.",Jennifer Tom; Min Bao; Larry Tsai; Aditi Qamra; David Summers; Montserrat Carrasco-Triguero; Jacqueline McBride; Carrie M Rosenberger; Celia J F Lin; William Stubbings; Kevin G Blyth; Jordi Carratala; Bruno Francois; Thomas Benfield; Derrick Haslem; Paolo Bonfanti; Cor H van der Leest; Nidhi Rohatgi; Lothar Wiese; Charles Edouard Luyt; Farrah Kheradmand; Ivan O Rosas; Fang Cai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20247379,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20247379,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True

We perform its statistical analysis and study epidemic geographical patterns. We observe exponentially distributed test positivity and exponential trends in its geographical distribution, and its approximately 10 km spatial characteristic correlation length. A small correlation between positivity in two consecutive testing rounds appeared on the municipalities level but it significantly increased on the counties level. Recent 7-day PCR tests incidence per capita served as a good proxy for antigen test positivity. Positivity of non-residents was higher than of residents when mass testing was offered only in municipalities with the highest positivity in previous rounds. Reduction in positivity in repeated testing increased with the positivity in the earlier round.

47,Support and follow-up needs of patients discharged from Intensive Care after severe COVID-19: a mixed-methods study of the views of UK general practitioners and intensive care staff during the pandemic's first wave,"BackgroundAfter discharge from an intensive care unit(ICU), over 50% of patients face significant physical, mental and cognitive problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large cohort of these patients who will need follow-up services that can address their support needs.

ObjectivesTo identify follow-up services planned for COVID-19 patients discharged from ICU, and to explore the views of ICU staff and General Practitioners(GPs) regarding these patients future needs and care coordination.

DesignSequential mixed-methods UK study. We explored usual follow-up practice after ICU discharge and changes in follow-up during the pandemic through a survey of ICU staff, and GP awareness of follow-up and support needs of patients discharged from ICU through a survey of GPs. Through these surveys, we identified participants for semi-structured interviews with both groups.

ResultsWe obtained 170 survey responses and conducted 23 interviews. Over 60% of GPs were unaware of the follow-up services generally provided by their local hospitals, and whether or not these were functioning during the pandemic. Eighty percent of ICUs reported some form of follow-up services, with 25% of these suspending provision during the peak of the pandemic, and over half modifying their provision (usually to provide the service remotely). Complex funding streams, poor communication between primary and secondary care, and lack of clarity about who was responsible for referrals and follow-up were the most common problems identified. Discharge documentation was described as poor and lacking key information. Both groups mentioned difficulties accessing services in the community.

ConclusionsThe pandemic has highlighted long-standing issues of continuity of care and complex funding streams for post-ICU follow-up care. The large cohort of ICU patients admitted due to COVID-19 highlights the need for improved follow-up services and communication between specialists and GPs, not only for COVID-19 patients, but for all those discharged from ICU.

49,Differential Dynamic Behavior of Prefusion Spike Proteins of SARS Coronaviruses 1 and 2,"Within the last two decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) have caused two major outbreaks. For reasons yet to be fully understood the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been significantly more widespread than the 2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-1, despite striking similarities between the two viruses. One of the most variable genes differentiating SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is the S gene that encodes the spike glycoprotein. This protein mediates a crucial step in the infection, i.e., host cell recognition and viral entry, which starts with binding to the host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for both viruses. Recent structural and functional studies have shed light on the differential binding behavior of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. In particular, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies show that ACE2 binding is preceded by a large-scale conformational change in the spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain (RBD) to its binding partner. Unfortunately, these studies do not provide detailed information on the dynamics of this activation process. Here, we have used an extensive set of unbiased and biased microsecond-timescale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomains in explicit solvent to determine the differential behavior of spike protein activation in the two viruses. Our results based on nearly 50 microseconds of equilibrium and nonequilibrium MD simulations indicate that the active form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is considerably more stable than the active SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Unlike the active SARS-CoV-2 spike, the active SARS-CoV-1 spike spontaneously undergoes a large-scale conformational transition to a pseudo-inactive state, which occurs in part due to interactions between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD that are absent in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Steered MD (SMD) simulations indicate that the energy barriers between active and inactive states are comparatively lower for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the greater propensity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to remain in the active conformation contributes to the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1. These results strongly suggest that the differential binding behavior of the active SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins is not merely due to differences in their RBDs as other domains of the spike protein such as the NTD could play a crucial role in the effective binding process, which involves the prebinding activation. Therefore, our hypothesis predicts that mutations in regions such as the NTD, which is not directly involved in binding, may lead to a change in the effective binding behavior of the coronavirus.",Vivek Govind Kumar; Dylan S Ogden; Ugochi Isu; Adithya Polasa; James Losey; Mahmoud Moradi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.424008,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.424008,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
50,Influence of HLA class II polymorphism on predicted cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 at the population and individual level,"Development of effective adaptive immune responses after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is predicated on recognition of viral peptides, presented in the context of HLA class II molecules, by CD4+ T-cells. We capitalised on extensive high resolution HLA data deposited in the National Marrow Donor Program registry to obtain detailed information on human HLA haplotype frequencies of twenty five human populations and used a bioinformatics approach to investigate the role of HLA polymorphism on SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity at the population and at the individual level. Within populations, we identify wide inter-individual variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity against structural, non-structural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to expressed HLA genotype. However, we find similar potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity at the population level, across all ethnic groups examined, suggesting that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after COVID-19 among different race and ethnic groups. We predict robust immune reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the basis for the majority of current vaccination efforts, both at the population and individual level, despite significant variation in Spike-derived peptide presentation by individual HLA genotypes. Finally, we provide comprehensive maps of SARS-CoV-2 proteome immunogenicity accounting for population coverage in major ethnic groups. Our findings provide important insight on the potential role of HLA polymorphism on development of protective immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination and a firm basis for further experimental studies in this field.",Hannah Charlotte Copley; Loren Gragert; Andrew R Leach; Vasilis Kosmoliaptsis,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424326,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424326,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
51,"TCR meta-clonotypes for biomarker discovery with tcrdist3: quantification of public, HLA-restricted TCR biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection","As the mechanistic basis of adaptive cellular antigen recognition, T cell receptors (TCRs) encode clinically valuable information that reflects prior antigen exposure and potential future response. However, despite advances in deep repertoire sequencing, enormous TCR diversity complicates the use of TCR clonotypes as clinical biomarkers. We propose a new framework that leverages antigen-enriched repertoires to form meta-clonotypes - groups of biochemically similar TCRs - that can be used to robustly quantify functionally similar TCRs in bulk repertoires. We apply the framework to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1,915 public TCR meta-clonotypes from the 18 SARS-CoV-2 antigen-enriched repertoires with the strongest evidence of HLA-restriction. Applied to independent cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact amino acid matches, and 44% (845/1915) were significantly enriched among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting HLA allele, demonstrating the potential utility of meta-clonotypes as antigen-specific features for biomarker development. To enable further applications, we developed an open-source software package, tcrdist3, that implements this framework and facilitates workflows for distance-based TCR repertoire analysis.",Koshlan Mayer-Blackwell; Philip Harlan Bradley; Andrew Fiore-Gartland,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424260,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424260,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
52,Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 can be accelerated by a mutation in the nsp14 gene,"Nucleotide substitution rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is relatively low compared to the other RNA viruses because coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 encode non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) that is an error-correcting exonuclease protein. In this study, to understand genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic, we examined mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 which could inhibit its error-correcting function. First, to obtain functionally important sites of nsp14, we examined 62 representative coronaviruses belonging to alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and unclassified coronaviruses. As a result, 99 out of 527 amino acid sites of nsp14 were evolutionarily conserved. We then examined nsp14 sequences obtained from 28,082 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified 6 amino acid changes in nsp14 mutants that were not detected in the 62 representative coronaviruses. We examined genome substitution rates of these mutants and found that an nsp14 mutant with a proline to leucine change at position 203 (P203L) showed a higher substitution rate (35.9 substitutions/year) than SARS-CoV-2 possessing wild-type nsp14 (19.8 substitutions/year). We confirmed that the substitution rate of the P203L is significantly higher than those of other variants containing mutations in structural proteins. Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing P203L mutation of nsp14 is limited (26), these mutants appeared at least 10 times independently in the current pandemic. These results indicated that the molecular function of nsp14 is important for survival of various coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and that some mutations such as P203L of nsp14 inhibiting its error-correcting function are removed rapidly due to their deleterious effects.",Kosuke Takada; Mahoko Takahashi Ueda; Tokiko Watanabe; So Nakagawa,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424231,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424231,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False

An urgent understanding of N501Y mechanism of action at molecular level is highly required. Here, we present the preliminary results of our Free energy perturbation (FEP) and Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations for the interaction of the spike S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) with both the ACE2 receptor and an antibody, STE90-C11, derived from COVID-19 patients. The results shown that the S1 RBD-ACE2 interaction was increased whereas those with the STE90-C11 antibody significantly decreased (over about 160 times). This may explain the observed in UK more spread of the virus but also emerge an important question about the possible human immune response and already available vaccines.

Here we present twelve complete autopsies, including two rapid autopsies of young patients where the cause of death was Covid-19 ARDS. The main virus induced pathology was in the lung parenchyma and not in the airways. Most coagulation events occurred in the intra-alveolar and not in the intra-vascular space and the few thrombi were mainly composed of aggregated thrombocytes. The dominant inflammatory response was the massive accumulation of CD163+ macrophages and the disappearance of T killer, NK and B-cells. The virus was replicating in the pneumocytes and macrophages but not in bronchial epithelium, endothel, pericytes or stromal cells. The lung consolidations were produced by a massive regenerative response, stromal and epithelial proliferation and neovascularization.

55,Let the DOCTOR Decide Whom to Test: Adaptive Testing Strategies to Tackle the COVID-19 Pandemic,"A robust testing program is necessary for containing the spread of COVID-19 infections before a vaccine becomes available. However, due to an acute shortage of testing kits (especially in low-resource developing countries), designing an optimal testing program/strategy is a challenging problem to solve. Prior literature on testing strategies suffers from two major limitations: (i) it does not account for the trade-off between testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and (ii) it primarily focuses on static testing strategies, which leads to significant shortcomings in the testing programs effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations by making five novel contributions. (i) We formally define the optimal testing problem and propose the DOCTOR POMDP model to tackle it. (ii) We solve the DOCTOR POMDP using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search based algorithm. (iii) We provide a rigorous experimental analysis of DOCTORs testing strategies against static baselines - our results show that when applied to the city of Santiago in Panama, DOCTORs strategies result in [~]40% fewer COVID-19 infections (over one month) as compared to state-of-the-art static baselines. (iv) In addition, we analyze DOCTORs testing policy to derive insights about the reasons behind the optimality of DOCTORs testing policy. (v) Finally, we characterize conditions (of the real world) under which DOCTORs optimization would be of most benefit to government policy makers, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area.

Mutations on the S-RBD may alter its affinity to cell receptor and affect the potency of vaccines and antibodies. Here we used an in-silico approach to predict how mutations on RBD affect its binding affinity to hACE2 (human angiotensin-converting enzyme2). The effect of all single point mutations on the interface was predicted. SPR assay result shows that 6 out of 9 selected mutations can strengthen binding affinity.

58,Extensive High-Order Complexes within SARS-CoV-2 Proteome Revealed by Compartmentalization-Aided Interaction Screening,"Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genome in nature, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes sophisticated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), mainly composed of a network of nonstructural proteins and nucleocapsid protein, to establish efficient infection. Here, we developed an innovative interaction screening strategy based on phase separation in cellulo, namely compartmentalization of protein-protein interactions in cells (CoPIC). Utilizing CoPIC screening, we mapped the interaction network among RTC-related viral proteins. We identified a total of 47 binary interactions among 14 proteins governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses. Further exploration via CoPIC led to the discovery of extensive ternary complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order complexes. Taken together, our results present an efficient, and robust interaction screening strategy, and indicate the existence of a complex interaction network among RTC-related factors, thus opening up new opportunities to understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and develop therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.",Weifan Xu; Gaofeng Pei; Hongrui Liu; Jing Wang; Pilong Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424422,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424422,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
59,A New State-Space Epidemiological Model for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Non-Medical Interventions- A Study on COVID-19 in California and Florida,"In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of infecteds are expected to remain undetected, and hence, are not quarantined. This, in turn, defeats the whole purpose of non-medical containment measures, like quarantine, lockdown, travel ban, physical distancing etc., by keeping the average reproduction rate above 1. To stress upon the importance of extensive random testing for breaking the chains of transmissions, we have formulated a detailed framework for carrying out cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of extensive random testing in comparison to targeted testing (the existing testing policy followed by most countries). This framework can be easily extended for CEA of any other non-medical or even medical interventions for containing epidemics.

We have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered-deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure. As an application, the proposed methodology is implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida, and further carry out CEA of extensive random testing over targeted testing.

60,Surveillance of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in school children and point-prevalence during a time of high community transmission in Switzerland,"BackgroundSwitzerland had one of the highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Europe during the second wave. Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place. However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes.

Methods14 out of the randomly selected sample of the Ciao Corona cohort study participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections of school children attending primary and secondary school. A buccal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days.

ResultsOut of 1299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least 1 of 2 testings. None of the teachers but 1 child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2% (95% CI 0.0% to 1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7 (0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in a new buccal sample taken 2 hours to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. 35% of children and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing.

ConclusionIn a setting of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures in place (e.g., clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the low point prevalence even in a setting of very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for symptomatic children and school personnel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools.

62,Financial Hardship and Social Assistance as Determinants of Mental Health and Food and Housing Insecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundWhile social assistance through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided expanded UI benefits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic until July 2020, it is unclear whether social assistance was in subsequent months sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb adverse sequelae of financial hardship. Among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic, this study explored the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance.

MethodsUsing multivariable logistic regression and pooled repeated cross-sectional individual-level data on working-aged adults from nationally-representative surveys administered from September to November 2020, this study investigated the relationships between financial hardship and depressive and anxiety symptoms, food insufficiency, and, among housing renters, the likelihood of being evicted, controlling for the receipt of social assistance and other demographic and socioeconomic factors.

ResultsExperiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship) was linked to approximately 3-4 times higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms and a likely eviction, and a 15 times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted a 6-fold higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms, a 24-fold higher odds of a likely eviction, and a more than 50-fold higher odds of food insufficiency (all P values <.001).

ConclusionsEven after accounting for receipt of social assistance, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety or depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship, and more than offset any corresponding benefits from social assistance.

63,"Understanding Covid-19 misinformation and vaccine hesitancy in context: Findings from a qualitative study involving citizens in Bradford, UK","BackgroundCovid-19 vaccines can offer a route out of the pandemic, yet initial research suggests that many are unwilling to be vaccinated. A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in this vaccine hesitancy. In order to maximise vaccine uptake it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain populations and places.

ObjectiveTo understand peoples Covid-19 beliefs, their interactions with health (mis)information during Covid-19 and attitudes towards a Covid-19 vaccine.

Design and participantsIn-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted.

ResultsParticipants spoke about a wide range of emotive misinformation they had encountered regarding Covid-19, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine.

ConclusionsCovid-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localised and empathetic response to counter misinformation.

64,"Mental health, personality and lifetime psychedelic use during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences represent a major challenge to the mental health and well-being of the general population. Some groups may be more vulnerable than others, depending on factors such as preexisting conditions, personality, and past life experiences. Building on previous work on the potential long-term benefits of psychedelics, we hypothesized that lifetime use of these drugs could be linked to better mental health indicators in the context of the ongoing pandemic.

MethodsTwo anonymous online surveys were conducted between April 2020 and June 2020, including questions about lifetime experience with psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs, and psychometric scales designed to measure personality traits, anxiety, negative and positive affect, well-being and resilience. Principal component analysis was applied to divide the sample into groups of subjects based on their drug use reports.

Results5618 participants (29.15 {+/-} 0.12 years, 71.97% female) completed both surveys and met the inclusion criteria, with 32.43% of the final sample reporting at least one use of a psychedelic drug. Lifetime psychedelic use was linked to increased openness and decreased conscientiousness, and with higher scores of positive affect. The reported number of past psychedelic experiences predicted higher scores of the secondary personality trait beta factor, which has been interpreted as a measure of plasticity. No significant associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and indicators of impaired mental health were observed.

ConclusionWe did not find evidence of an association between lifetime use of psychedelics and poor mental health indicators. Conversely, experience with psychedelic drugs was linked to increased positive affect and to personality traits that favor resilience and stability in the light of the ongoing crisis.

Respondents experienced symptoms in an average of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 9.04 to 9.13) organ systems. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were: fatigue (77.7%, 74.9% to 80.3%), post-exertional malaise (72.2%, 69.3% to 75.0%), and cognitive dysfunction (55.4%, 52.4% to 58.8%). These three symptoms were also the three most commonly reported overall. In those who recovered in less than 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at week 2 (11.4, 9.4 to 13.6), and in those who did not recover in 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at month 2 (17.2, 16.5 to 17.8). Respondents with symptoms over 6 months experienced an average of 13.8 (12.7 to 14.9) symptoms in month 7. 85.9% (84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 45.2% (42.9% to 47.2%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 22.3% (20.5% to 24.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.

66,Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England,"A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.",Nicholas G Davies; Rosanna C. Barnard; Christopher I.

67,SARS-CoV-2 infecting the inner ear results in potential hearing damage at the early stage or prognosis of COVID-19 in rodents,"ObjectivesIn order to find out the association between the sensorineural hearing loss and COVID-19, we detected the expression ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mouse the hamster.

DesignUsing the public data from NCBI and GISAID, we assessed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the transcriptomic, DNA, and protein levels of ACE2 in the brain, inner ear, and muscle from the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and mouse (Mus musculus).

ResultsWe identified ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressed at different level in the inner ear and brain at DNA and transcriptomic levels of both mouse and the hamster. The protein expression shows a similar pattern of the brain and inner ear, while the expression of ACE2 from the inner ear was relatively higher than it from the muscle.

68,Patterns of within-host genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2,"Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing transmission chains has become a major public health focus for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1,181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within and between host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.",Gerry Tonkin-Hill; Inigo Martincorena; Roberto Amato; Andrew R J Lawson; Moritz Gerstung; Ian Johnston; David K Jackson; Naomi R Park; Stefanie V Lensing; Michael A Quail; Sónia Gonçalves; Cristina Ariani; Michael Spencer Chapman; William L Hamilton; Luke W Meredith; Grant Hall; Aminu S Jahun; Yasmin Chaudhry; Myra Hosmillo; Malte L Pinckert; Iliana Georgana; Anna Yakovleva; Laura G Caller; Sarah L Caddy; Theresa Feltwell; Fahad A Khokhar; Charlotte J Houldcroft; Martin D Curran; Surendra Parmar; - The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium; Alex Alderton; Rachel Nelson; Ewan Harrison; John Sillitoe; Stephen D Bentley; Jeffrey C Barrett; M.

69,A SARS-CoV-2 spike binding DNA aptamer that inhibits pseudovirus infection in vitro by an RBD independent mechanism,"The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2-S) binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2-S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2-S and does not block the interaction of CoV2-S with ACE2. Notwithstanding, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS-CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.",Anton Schmitz; Anna Weber; Mehtap Bayin; Stefan Breuers; Michael Famulok; Gunter Mayer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424171,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424171,2020-12-25,2020-12-25,,False

There is an urgent need for novel antiviral drugs for therapeutic or prophylactic application. Cathepsin L is a key host cysteine protease utilized by coronaviruses for cell entry and is recognized as a promising drug target. The marine natural product, gallinamide A and several synthetic analogues, were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin L activity with IC50 values in the picomolar range. Lead molecules possessed selectivity over cathepsin B and other related human cathepsin proteases and did not exhibit inhibitory activity against viral proteases Mpro and PLpro.

71,Detection and molecular characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed mink (Neovision vision) in Poland,"SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of COVID-19 disease and has been spreading worldwide since December 2019. The virus has been shown to infect different animal species under experimental conditions. Also, minks have been found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in fur farms in Europe and the USA. Here we investigated 91 individual minks from a farm located in Northern Poland. Using RT-PCR, antigen detection and NGS, we confirmed 15 animals positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result was verified by sequencing of full viral genomes, confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection in Polish mink. Country-scale monitoring conducted by veterinary inspection so far has not detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on other mink farms. Taking into consideration that Poland has a high level of positive diagnostic tests among its population, there is a high risk that more Polish mink farms become a source for SARS-CoV-2. Findings reported here and from other fur producing countries urge the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in animals bred in Polish fur farms.",Lukasz Rabalski; Maciej Kosinski; Teemu Smura; Kirsi Aaltonen; Ravi Kant; Tarja Sironen; Boguslaw Szewczyk; Maciej Grzybek,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.422670,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.422670,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,False

73,Real-time monitoring epidemic trends and key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 evolution by an automated tool,"With the global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to monitor the variation, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations of SARS-CoV-2 over time effectively, which is of great significance to the development of new vaccines, the update of therapeutic drugs, and the improvement of detection reagents. The AutoVEM tool developed in the present study could complete all mutations detections, haplotypes classification, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations analysis for 131,576 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in 18 hours on a 1 core CPU and 2G internal storage computer. Through haplotype subgroup epidemic trends analysis of 131,576 genome sequences, the great significance of the previous 4 specific sites (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) was further revealed, and 6 new mutation sites of highly linked (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) were discovered for the first time that might be related to the infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. In brief, we proposed an integrative method and developed an efficient automated tool to monitor haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and screen out the key mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time for the first time, and all data could be updated quickly to track the prevalence of previous key mutations and new key mutations because of high efficiency of the tool.

74,Cell-type apoptosis in lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has inspired renewed interest in understanding the fundamental pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following infection because fatal COVID-19 cases are commonly linked to respiratory failure due to ARDS. The pathologic alteration known as diffuse alveolar damage in endothelial and epithelial cells is a critical feature of acute lung injury in ARDS. However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRAS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown.

In the present study, we examined apoptosis in post-mortem lung sections from COVID-19 patients and lung tissues from a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a cell-type manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and T cells. Multiple-target immunofluorescence (IF) assays and western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (i.e., BEAS2B cells) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infection of co-cultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECs/BEAS2B cells, but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus. Post-exposure treatment of the co-culture of Vero cells and HUVECs with an EPAC1-specific activator ameliorated apoptosis in HUVECs. These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Yakun Liu; Tania M. Garron; Qing Chang; Zhengchen Su; Changcheng Zhou; Eric C.

75,Berberine and obatoclax inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human nasal epithelial cells in vitro,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in late 2019 and has infected an estimated 10% of the global population in less than a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that could be considered for further efficacy testing.",Finny S. Varghese; Esther van Woudenbergh; Gijs J.

76,Exploring epitope and functional diversity of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies using AI-based methods,"Since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemics, an unprecedented research effort has been conducted to analyze the antibody responses in patients, and many trials based on passive immunotherapy -- notably monoclonal antibodies -- are ongoing. Twenty-one antibodies have entered clinical trials, 6 having reached phase 2/3, phase 3 or having received emergency authorization. These represent only the tip of the iceberg, since many more antibodies have been discovered and represent opportunities either for diagnosis purposes or as drug candidates. The main problem facing laboratories willing to develop such antibodies is the huge task of analyzing them and choosing the best candidate for exhaustive experimental validation. In this work we show how artificial intelligence-based methods can help in analyzing large sets of antibodies in order to determine in a few hours the best candidates in few hours. The MAbCluster method, which only requires knowledge of the amino acid sequences of the antibodies, allows to group the antibodies having the same epitope, considering only their amino acid sequences and their 3D structures (actual or predicted), and to infer some of their functional properties. We then use MAbTope to predict the epitopes for all antibodies for which they are not already known. This allows an exhaustive comparison of the available epitopes, but also gives a synthetic view of the possible combinations. Finally, we show how these results can be used to predict which antibodies might be affected by the different mutations arising in the circulating strains of the virus, such as the N501Y mutation that has started to spread in Great-Britain.",Christophe Dumet; Yann Jullian; Astrid Musnier; Philippe Rivière; Nicolas Poirier; Hervé Watier; Thomas Bourquard; Anne Poupon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424199,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424199,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,False

We captured thermal images of the back of individuals with and without COVID-19 using a portable thermal camera that connects directly to smartphones. Our novel image processing algorithms automatically extracted multiple texture and shape features of the thermal images and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 in detecting COVID-19 with up to 92% sensitivity. Thermal imaging scores were inversely correlated with clinical variables associated with COVID-19 disease progression.

In Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung injury by SARS-CoV-2 and impaired immune response can provide a favorable environment for microorganism growth and colonization in hospitalized individuals. Recent studies suggest that secondary bacterial pneumonia is a risk factor associated with COVID-19. In Brazil, knowledge about microbiota present in COVID-19 patients is incipient. This work describes the microbiota of 21 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units from two Brazilian centers. We identified respiratory, nosocomial and bacterial pathogens as prevalent microorganisms. Other bacterial opportunistic and commensal species are also represented. Virulence factors of these pathogenic species, metabolic pathways used to evade and modulate immunological processes and the interconnection between bacterial presence and virulence in COVID-19 progression are discussed.

80,"Real-world clinical performance of commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in suspected COVID-19: A systematic meta-analysis of available data as per November 20, 2020","BackgroundImmunochromatographic rapid antigen tests (RATs) emerged onto the COVID-19 pandemic testing landscape to aid in the rapid diagnosis of people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RATs are particularly useful where RT-PCR is not immediately available and symptoms suggestive of a high viral load and infectiousness are assumed. Several lateral flow immunoassays have been authorized for use under EUA and/or the CE mark, presenting varying overall clinical performance data generated by the manufacturer or by independent investigators. To compare the real-world clinical performance of commercially available rapid chromatographic immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of published data.

MethodsWe searched the MEDLINE(R), Embase, BIOSIS and Derwent Drug File (ProQuest)for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR assays. Only studies on lateral flow assays not needing a separate reader for retrieving the result were included, if data were available on viral load, patients symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used. For better data comparability, recalculation of the studies single performance data confidence intervals using the exact Clopper-Pearson method was applied.

ResultsWe could include 19 studies (ten peer-reviewed) presenting detailed clinical performance data on 11,209 samples with 2449 RT-PCR-positives out of study prevalence rates between 1.9-100 % and between 50- 100% symptomatic samples. Four studies directly compared two to three different RATs and 15 studies compared one RAT to RT-PCR. Overall specificity ranged, with one test outlier, between 92.4% (87.4- 95.9) and 100% (99.7-100), and overall clinical sensitivity varied between 28.9% (16.4-44.3) and 98.3% (91.1-99.7), depending on assay, population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold [&le;]25) showed a considerable heterogeneity among the assays ranging from 66.7% to 100%.

ConclusionOnly two RATs offered sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data supporting use for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic or high-viral-load patient populations. Reliable positive predictive values require testing of symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals only in case of a high pre-test probability. If RATs are used for screening of asymptomatic cases in low-prevalence scenarios, a lower positive predictive value of the result has to be considered.",Johannes Hayer; Dusanka Kasapic; Claudia Silke Zemmrich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248614,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248614,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
81,Predicting the Evolution of COVID-19 Mortality Risk: a Recurrent Neural Network Approach,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe propagation of COVID-19 in Spain prompted the declaration of the state of alarm on March 14, 2020. On 2 December 2020, the infection had been confirmed in 1,665,775 patients and caused 45,784 deaths. This unprecedented health crisis challenged the ingenuity of all professionals involved. Decision support systems in clinical care and health services management were identified as crucial in the fight against the pandemic.

MethodsThis study applies Deep Learning techniques for mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients. Two datasets with clinical information (medication, laboratory tests, vital signs etc.) of 2,307 and 3,870 COVID-19 infected patients admitted to two Spanish hospital chains were used. Firstly, we built a sequence of temporal events gathering all the clinical information for each patient. Next, we used the temporal sequences to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with an attention mechanism exploring interpretability. We conducted extensive experiments and trained the RNNs in different settings, performing hyperparameter search and cross-validation. We ensembled resulting RNNs to reduce variability and enhance sensitivity.

ResultsWe assessed the performance of our models using both global metrics, by averaging the performance across all the days in the sequences. We also measured day-by-day metrics starting from the day of hospital admission and the outcome day and evaluated the daily predictions. Regarding sensitivity, when compared to more traditional models, our best two RNN ensemble models outper-form a Support Vector Classifier in 6 and 16 percentage points, and Random Forest in 23 and 18 points. For the day-by-day predictions from the outcome date, the models also achieved better results than baselines showing systems ability towards early predictions.

ConclusionsWe have shown the feasibility of our approach to predict the clinical outcome (i.e. discharged alive or death) of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The result is a time series model that can support decision-making in healthcare systems and aims at interpretability. Despite the low-resource scenario, the results achieved are promising and suggests that more data will further increase the performance of the model.",Marta Villegas; Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre; Asier Gutiérrez-Fandiño; Jordi Armengol-Estapé; Casimiro Pio Carrino; David Pérez Fernández; Felipe Soares; Pablo Serrano; Miguel Pedrera; Noelia García; Alfonso Valencia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20244061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20244061,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
82,Hospitalization for self-harm during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France: a nationwide study,"IntroductionLittle is known to date about the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on self-harm incidence.

MethodsThe number of hospitalizations for self-harm in France (mainland and overseas) from January to August 2020 (which includes the first confinement from March 17th to May 11th) was compared to the same period in 2019-2017. Hospital data with the ICD-10 codes X60-84 were extracted from the national administrative database (PMSI).

ResultsThere were 53,583 hospitalizations for self-harm in France between January and August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 8.5% decrease. This decrease started the first week of the confinement and the number of hospitalizations remained at lower levels relative to 2019 until the end of August. The decrease was more marked in women (-9.8%) than men (-6.4%). However, an increase in hospitalizations was observed in individuals aged 75 and older (+5.3 to +11.6%). Moreover, the number of self-harm by firearm (+20.3%), jumping from height (+10.5%), and drowning (+4.7%) increased between 2019 and 2020, as well as the number of hospitalizations in intensive care (+3.5%) and deaths at discharge from hospital (+8.0%). No correlation was found between the evolution in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm and the number of severe cases of Covid-19 (hospitalization and mortality rates) across administrative departments.

DiscussionDuring the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France - including the first confinement -, a general decrease in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm was observed. However, an increase was found among elderly, a population at higher Covid 19-related mortality risk, and in the number of more severe suicidal acts. These results, therefore, shed light on a complex relationship between the pandemic and self-harm occurrence. This situation may change with time, which requires active suicide prevention strategies.",Fabrice Jollant; Adrien Roussot; Emmanuelle Corruble; Jean-Christophe CHAUVET-GELINIER; Bruno Falissard; Yann Mikaeloff; Catherine Quantin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248480,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248480,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
83,Coronavirus GenBrowser for monitoring adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 has widely spread across the world, and much research is being conducted on the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. To help control the infection, we developed the Coronavirus GenBrowser (CGB) to monitor the pandemic. CGB allows visualization and analysis of the latest viral genomic data. Distributed genome alignments and an evolutionary tree built on the existing subtree are implemented for easy and frequent updates. The tree-based data are compressed at a ratio of 2,760:1, enabling fast access and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CGB can effectively detect adaptive evolution of specific alleles, such as D614G of the spike protein, in their early stage of spreading. By lineage tracing, the most recent common ancestor, dated in early March 2020, of nine strains collected from six different regions in three continents was found to cause the outbreak in Xinfadi, Beijing, China in June 2020. CGB also revealed that the first COVID-19 outbreak in Washington State was caused by multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2. To encourage data sharing, CGB credits the person who first discovers any SARS-CoV-2 variant. As CGB is developed with eight different languages, it allows the general public in many regions of the world to easily access pre-analyzed results of more than 132,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. CGB is an efficient platform to monitor adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Dalang Yu; Xiao Yang; Bixia Tang; Yi-Hsuan Pan; Jianing Yang; Junwei Zhu; Guangya Duan; Zi-Qian Hao; Hailong Mu; Long Dai; Wangjie Hu; - Language translation team; Xiao Su; Guo-Qing Zhang; Wenming Zhao; Haipeng Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248612,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248612,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
84,Identifying communities at risk for COVID-19-related burden across 500 U.S. Cities and within New York City,"BackgroundWhile it is well-known that older individuals with certain comorbidities are at highest risk for complications related to COVID-19 including hospitalization and death, we lack tools to identify communities at highest risk with fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Information collected at a county level obscures local risk and complex interactions between clinical comorbidities, the built environment, population factors, and other social determinants of health.

MethodsWe develop a robust COVID-19 Community Risk Score (C-19 Risk Score) that summarizes the complex disease co-occurrences for individual census tracts with unsupervised learning, selected on their basis for association with risk for COVID complications, such as death. We mapped the C-19 Risk Score onto neighborhoods in New York City and associated the score with C-19 related death. We further predict the C-19 Risk Score using satellite imagery data to map the built environment in C-19 Risk.

ResultsThe C-19 Risk Score describes 85% of variation in co-occurrence of 15 diseases that are risk factors for COVID complications among 26K census tract neighborhoods (median population size of tracts: 4,091). The C-19 Risk Score is associated with a 40% greater risk for COVID-19 related death across NYC (April and September 2020) for a 1SD change in the score (Risk Ratio for 1SD change in C19 Risk Score: 1.4, p < .001). Satellite imagery coupled with social determinants of health explain nearly 90% of the variance in the C-19 Risk Score in the United States in held-out census tracts (R2 of 0.87).

ConclusionsThe C-19 Risk Score localizes COVID-19 risk at the census tract level and predicts COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.",Chirag J Patel; Andrew Deonarine; Genevieve Lyons; Chirag Lakhani; Arjun K Manrai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248360,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248360,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
85,"Risk factors for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A cross-sectional study in 116,678 people.","BackgroundThe risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well characterised in Western populations. We sought to identify potential risk factors for transmission and actionable information to prevent for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsIndividuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 at four major laboratories were invited. In addition, participants were sampled by convenience after a media campaign. Self-reported test results were compared with laboratory results, demographic data and behavioural facts were collected using a digital platform. In a cross-sectional design positive cases were compared with negative and untested control groups.

FindingsApproximately 14 days after a countrywide lockdown in Norway, 116,678 participants were included. Median age was 46 years, 44% had children in preschool or in school; 18% were practicing health professionals. International flights, contact with infected, and gatherings of more than 50 people, were associated with high risk. Health professionals who used public transport were at higher risk of testing positive than those who did not. Having undergone light infections, the last six months was strongly associated with lower odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Contact with children, use of hand sanitiser and use of protective gloves in private were also associated with lower odds ratio of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.

InterpretationFurther research is needed to explore if being a parent or looking after children is associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the next phases of the pandemic. Immunological research should be done to determine the effects of prior trivial infections on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirm that large gatherings during the pandemic should be avoided and those who are infected, or under suspicion thereof, posed very high risks to others this population.",Eyrun F Kjetland; Karl Trygve Kalleberg; Camilla Lund Soraas; Bato Hammarstrom; Tor Age Myklebust; Synne Jenum; Eyvind Axelsen; Andreas Lind; Roar Bevre-Jensen; Silje Bakken Jorgensen; Frank Olav Pettersen; Lene B Solberg; Cathrine Lund Hadley; Mette Stausland Istre; Knut Liestol; John Arne Dahl; Giske Ursin; Arne Soraas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248514,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248514,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
86,"Reducing contacts to stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the second pandemic wave in Brussels, Belgium","BackgroundReducing contacts is a cornerstone of containing SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the effect of physical distancing measures and of school reopening on contacts and consequently on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brussels, a hotspot during the second European wave.

MethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 case reports and contact tracing data during August-November 2020, we estimated changes in the age-specific number of reported contacts. We associated these trends with changes in the instantaneous reproduction number Rt and in age-specific transmission-events during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region. Furthermore, we analysed trends in age-specific case numbers, pre- and post-school opening.

FindingsWhen schools reopened and physical distancing measures relaxed, the weekly mean number of reported contacts surged from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) to 3.04 (95%CI 2.93-3.15), increasing across all ages. The fraction of cases aged 10-19 years started increasing before school reopening, with no further increase following school reopening (risk ratio 1.23, 95%CI 0.79-1.94). During the subsequent month, 8.9% (67/755) of infections identified were from teenagers to other ages, while 17.0% (131/755) from other ages to teenagers. Rt peaked mid-September at 1.48 (95%CI 1.35-1.63). Reintroduction of physical distancing measures reduced reported contacts to 1.85 (95%CI 1.78-1.91), resulting in Rt dropping below 1 within 3 weeks.

InterpretationThe second pandemic wave in Brussels was the result of increased contacts across all ages following school reopening. Stringent physical distancing measures, including closure of bars and limiting close contacts while schools remain open, reduced social mixing, in turn controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

87,Adenovirus and RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines: perceptions and acceptance among healthcare workers,"ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy, and acceptance rate of various COVID-19 vaccine types among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience.

DesignNational cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire.

SettingOnline, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs.

ParticipantsA total of 2,007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 75.3% completed the survey and were included in the analysis.

InterventionData were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during November 1-15, 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD7) scale.

ResultsAmong the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccines efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%), and the vaccines manufacturing country (28.6%).

ConclusionsAwareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination.

88,Toward a COVID-19 testing policy: where and how to test when the purpose is to isolate silent spreaders,"BackgroundTo stop pandemics, such as COVID-19, infected individuals should be detected, treated if needed, and -to prevent contacts with susceptible individuals-isolated. Because most infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when testing misses such cases, epidemics may growth exponentially, inducing a high number of deaths. In contrast, a relatively low number of COVID-19 related deaths may occur when both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are tested.

MethodsTo evaluate these hypotheses, a method composed of three elements was evaluated, which included: (i) county- and country-level geo-referenced data, (ii) cost-benefit related considerations, and (iii) temporal data on mortality or test positivity (TP). TP is the percentage of infections found among tested individuals. Temporal TP data were compared to the tests/case ratio (T/C ratio) as well as the number of tests performed/million inhabitants (tests/mi) and COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi).

FindingsTwo temporal TP profiles were distinguished, which, early, displayed low ([~] 1 %) and/or decreasing TP percentages or the opposite pattern, respectively. Countries that exhibited >10 TP % expressed at least ten times more COVID-19 related deaths/mi than low TP countries. An intermediate pattern was identified when the T/C ratio was explored. Geo-referenced, TP-based analysis discovered municipalities where selective testing would be more cost-effective than alternatives.

InterpretationsWhen TP is low and/or the T/C ratio is high, testing detects asymptomatic cases and the number of COVID-19 related deaths/mi is low. Geo-referenced TP data can support cost-effective, site-specific policies. TP promotes the prompt cessation of epidemics and fosters science-based testing policies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo map this field, bibliographic searches were conducted in the Web of Science, which included the following results: (i) COVID-19 (95,133 hits), (ii) SARS COV-2 (33,680 hits), (iii) testing policy and COVID-19 (939 hits), (iv) testing policy and SARS COV-2 (340 hits), (v) testing policy and COVID-19 and asymptomatic (80 hits), (vi) testing policy and SARS COV-2 and asymptomatic (54 hits); (vii) test positivity and COVID-19 and validation (7 hits), and (viii) test positivity and SARS CoV-2 and validation (5 hits). Therefore, before this study, testing policy in relation to asymptomatic cases as well as test positivity represented a very low proportion (between [~]1 thousandth to [~] 1 ten thousandth) of all publications. While many articles distinguished between diagnostic and screening tests, no paper was found in which testing policy is mentioned as part of a process ultimately designed to isolate all infected individuals. The few articles that mentioned test positivity only investigated symptomatic cases. These quanti/qualitative assessments led the authors to infer that neither testing policy nor test positivity had been adequately validated and/or investigated.

Added value of this studyWe provide the first validation of test positivity as an estimate of disease prevalence under rapidly changing conditions: in pandemics, disease prevalence may vary markedly within short periods of time. We also address a double limitation of control campaigns against COVID-19, namely: it is unknown who and where to test. Asymptomatic cases are not likely to seek medical assistance: while they feel well, they silently spread this pandemic. Because they represent approximately half of all infected individuals, they are a large, moving, and invisible target. Where to find them is also unknown because (i) randomized testing is likely to fail and (ii) testing is very limited. Usually, the locations where infected people reside are not randomly distributed but geographically clustered, and, up to now less than four persons per thousand inhabitants are tested on a given day. However, by combining geo-referenced test positivity data with cost-benefit considerations, we generate approaches not only likely to induce high benefits without increasing costs but also free of assumptions: we measure bio-geography as it is.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe fact that asymptomatic cases were not tested in many countries may explain the exponential growth and much higher number of deaths observed in those countries. Ineffective testing (and, therefore, ineffective isolation) can also result from the absence of geo-referenced data analysis. Because the geographical location where people reside, work, study, or shop is not a random event, the analysis of small greographical areas is essential. Only when actual geographical relationships are observed, optimal (cost-benefit oriented) testing policies can be devised.",Ariel L Rivas; Almira L Hoogesteijn; James Hittner; Marc HV van Regenmortel; Prakasha Kempaiah; Paris Vogazianos; Athos Antoniades; Jose PL Febles; Folorunso Oludayo Fasina,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20223651,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20223651,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
89,Analysis of genome characteristics and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 strains in North-East of Romania during the first COVID-19 outbreak,"Romania officially declared its first SARS-CoV-2 case on February 26, 2020. The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation.

To address this gap, we conducted a systematic post-mortem surveillance study to directly measure the fatal impact of CV19 in an urban African population.

DesignWe enrolled deceased individuals at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Morgue in Lusaka, Zambia. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs for testing via reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) against the SARS-2 Coronavirus. We stratified deaths by CV19 status, by location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors.

SettingUTH is Zambias largest tertiary care referral hospital and its morgue registers [~]80% of Lusakas deaths.

ParticipantsParticipants of all ages were enrolled if within 48 hours of death and if the next of kin or representative provided written informed consent.

ResultsWe enrolled 372 participants between June and September 2020, and had PCR results for 364 (99.5%). CV19 was detected in 70/364 (19.2%). The median age for CV19+ deaths was 48 years (IQR 36-72 years) and 70% were male. Most CV19+ deaths (51/70, 72.8%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for CV19 antemortem. Among the 19/70 facility deaths, six were tested antemortem. Among the 52/70 CV19 deaths with symptoms data, 44/52 had typical symptoms of CV19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested antemortem. We identified CV19 among seven children; only one had been tested antemortem. The proportion of CV19+ deaths increased with age, but 75.7% of CV19+ deaths were aged <60 years. The five most common co-morbidities among CV19+ deaths were: tuberculosis (31.4%); hypertension (27.1%); HIV/AIDS (22.9%); alcohol use (17.1%); and diabetes (12.9%).

ConclusionsContrary to expectations, CV19+ deaths were common in Lusaka. The majority occurred in the community where testing capacity is lacking. Yet few who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of CV19. Therefore, CV19 cases were under reported because testing was rarely done, not because CV19 was rare.

Blood tests on admission to the hospital can be useful for stratification of patients and timely correction. Our study investigated the clinical features of COVID-19 patients in Latvia and differences in blood tests in groups with different disease severity.

MethodsThe retrospective study included 100 patients hospitalized in Riga East Clinical University Hospital in Spring 2020. The severity of the disease course was classified by the presence of pneumonia and its combination with respiratory failure. We have assessed blood cells count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin T, electrolytes, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), D-dimer, prothrombin time, prothrombin index, oxygen saturation, and temperature on admission to the hospital.

ResultsPatients were from 18 to 99 (57{+/-}18 years, 57% males). Comorbidities were found in 74% of patients. The mild, moderate, and severe groups included 35, 44, and 16 patients, respectively. In the severe group, the mortality rate was 50%. The progression to severe COVID-19 was associated positively with temperature, ESR, CRP, creatinine, LDH, and troponin T and negatively associated with oxygen saturation, eosinophils, and GFR on admission to the hospital.

There is however little evidence for its usefulness. To test the effectiveness of such a device, we built a manikin that can expire micron-sized aerosols at flow rates close to physiological conditions. We then placed the manikin inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with sufficient suction, it is possible to effectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow rates (up to 60 L min-1) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%.

93,Emotional Adaptation During A Crisis: Decline in Anxiety and Depression After the Initial Weeks of COVID-19 in the United States,"ObjectiveCrises such as the COVID-19 pandemic are known to exacerbate depression and anxiety, though their temporal trajectories remain unclear. The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using COVID-19 as a model crisis.

Methods1,512 adults living in the U.S. enrolled in this online study on April 2nd, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4th, 2020; final n=537). Depression and anxiety were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related questions. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety.

ResultsDepression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time (F(9,4824)=17.53, p<.001 and F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, respectively). In addition to demographic factors such as sex, age, income, and psychiatric diagnoses, we identified some overlapping and some distinct dynamic factors contributing to changes in depression and anxiety: worsening of weekly individual economic impact of COVID-19 increased both depression and anxiety, while increased seven-day change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected pandemic duration were positively associated with anxiety, but not depression.

ConclusionsAlongside evidence for overall emotional adaptation, these findings highlight overlapping (economic), yet distinct (change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected COVID-19 duration) factors contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of COVID-19.

The aim was to compare anxiety, depression and coping styles between patients infected with COVID-19 disease with and without CMI during the peak of COVID-19 disease in Egypt. This is a cross sectional study, that included an online survey consisting of Arabic versions of General Health Questionnaire-12, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Brief-COPE scale. Questionnaires were distributed to adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during their quarantine in Egypt. One hundred ninety-nine patients responded to the survey, where 46.73% of them had CMI. Religion, emotional support, use of informational support and acceptance were the most used coping strategies by participants. Avoidant coping strategies were frequently used by divorced patients, home quarantined individuals, patients who developed COVID-19 related anxiety/depression and patients who didnt receive hydroxyl-chloroquine. Approach strategies were frequently used by patients with mild COVID-19. Understanding the used coping strategies has implications for how individuals might be helped to manage their illness during the current presentation and intervene with development of serious long-term mental health conditions.",hend Ibrahim Shousha; Nagwan Madbouly; Shimaa Afify; Noha Asem; Rabab Maher; suaad Moussa; Amr Abdalazeem; Eslam Nageb; Khaled harhira; Hazem Elmorsy; Hassan Elgarem; Dalia Omran; mohamed hassany; Basem elsayed; Mohamed El kassas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248379,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248379,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
95,"How the COVID-19 pandemic affects transgender health care in upper-middle income and high income countries - A worldwide, cross-sectional survey","BackgroundSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to medical care was restricted for nearly all non-acute medical conditions. Due to their status as a vulnerable social group and the inherent need for transition-related treatments (e.g., hormone treatment), transgender people are assumed to be affected particularly severely by the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and health care of transgender people.

Methods and findingsAs an ad hoc collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and 23 community organizations, we developed a web-based survey. The survey was translated into 26 languages, and participants were recruited via various social media and LGBTIQ-community sources. Recruitment started in May 2020. We assessed demographical data, physical and mental health problems (e.g., chronic physical conditions), risk factors (e.g., smoking), COVID-19 data (symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19), and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to transgender health care and health-related supplies. To identify factors associated with the experience of restrictions to transgender health care, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis.

5267 transgender people from 63 higher-middle income and high-income countries participated in the study. Over 50% of the participants had risk factors for a severe course of a COVID-19 infection and were at a high risk of avoiding testing or treatment of a COVID-19 infection due to the fear of mistreatment or discrimination. Access to transgender health care services was restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic for 50% of the participants. Male sex assigned at birth and a lower monthly income were significant predictors for the experience of restrictions to health care. 35.0% of the participants reported at least one mental health conditions. Every third participant had suicidal thoughts, and 3.2% have attempted suicide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A limitation of the study is that we did not analyze data from low-income countries and access to the internet was necessary to participate.

ConclusionsTransgender people are assumed to suffer under the severity of the pandemic even more than the general population due to the intersections between their status as a vulnerable social group, their high amount of medical risk factors, and their need for ongoing medical treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic can potentiate these vulnerabilities, add new challenges for transgender individuals, and, therefore, can lead to devastating consequences, like severe physical or mental health issues, self-harming behaviour, and suicidality.",Andreas Koehler; Joz Motmans; Leo Mulio Alvarez; David Azul; Karen Badalyan; Koray Basar; Cecilia Dhejne; Dragana Duisin; Bartosz Grabski; Aurore Dufrasne; Natasa Jokic-Begic; Antonio Prunas; Christina Richards; Kirill Sabir; Jaimie Vaele; Timo Ole Nieder,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248794,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248794,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
96,Environmental scan of provincial and territorial planning for COVID-19 vaccination programs,"BackgroundPublic health departments in Canada are currently facing the challenging task of planning and implementing COVID-19 vaccination programs.

ObjectiveTo collect and synthesize information regarding COVID-19 vaccination programs in each of the provinces and territories (P/Ts).

MethodsProvincial/territorial public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics, drawn from scientific literature and media: unique factors for COVID-19 vaccination, adoption of National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommendations, priority groups for early vaccination, and vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring. Data were grouped according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed.

ResultsEighteen interviews occurred with 25 participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. Factors unique to COVID-19 vaccination included prioritizing groups for early vaccination (n=7), public perception of vaccines (n=6), and differing eligibility criteria (n=5). Almost all P/Ts (n=10) reported reliance on NACI recommendations. Long-term care residents (n=10) and health care workers (n=10) were most frequently prioritized for early vaccination, followed by people with chronic medical conditions (n=9) and seniors (n=8). Most P/Ts (n=9) are planning routine adverse event monitoring to assess vaccine safety. Evaluation of effectiveness was anticipated to occur within public health departments (n=3), by researchers (n=3), or based on national guidance (n=4).

ConclusionPlans for COVID-19 vaccination programs in the P/Ts exhibit some similarities and are largely consistent with NACI guidelines, with some discrepancies.

97,Acceptance and Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccines: A Cross-Sectional Study from Jordan,"BackgroundVaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in Jordan.

MethodsAn online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines acceptability.

ResultsA total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR=2.488, 95CI%=1.834-3.375, p<.001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR=2.036, 95CI%=1.306-3.174, p=.002) were more likely to accept Covid-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed that vaccines are generally safe (OR=9.258, 95CI%=6.020-14.237, p<.001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR=19.223, 95CI%=13.665-27.042, p<.001), once available, were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR=0.376, 95CI%=0.233-0.607, p<.001) and employed participants (OR=0.542, 95CI%=0.405-0.725, p<.001) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR=0.502, 95CI%=0.356- 0.709, p<.001) and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19 vaccines (OR=0.271, 95CI%=0.183 - 0.400, p<.001), were less likely to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers.

ConclusionSystematic interventions are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of vaccines hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was utilized in their production.",Tamam El-Elimat; Mahmoud M.

98,Introduction into the Marseille geographical area of a mild SARS-CoV-2 variant originating from sub-Saharan Africa,"BACKGROUNDIn Marseille, France, the COVID-19 incidence evolved unusually with several successive epidemic episodes. The second outbreak started in July, was associated with North Africa, and involved travelers and an outbreak on passenger ships. This suggested the involvement of a new viral variant.

METHODSWe sequenced the genomes from 916 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in our institute. The patients demographic and clinical features were compared according to the infecting viral variant.

RESULTSFrom June 26th to August 14th, we identified a new viral variant (Marseille-1). Based on genome sequences (n=89) or specific qPCR (n=53), 142 patients infected with this variant were detected. It is characterized by a combination of 10 mutations located in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp12, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N/ORF14 genes. We identified Senegal and Gambia, where the virus had been transferred from China and Europe in February-April as the sources of the Marseille-1 variant, which then most likely reached Marseille through Maghreb when French borders reopened. In France, this variant apparently remained almost limited to Marseille. In addition, it was significantly associated with a milder disease compared to clade 20A ancestor strains.

99,"Evaluation of the Effect of Zinc, Quercetin, Bromelain and Vitamin C on COVID-19 Patients","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. There are three phases of COVID-19: early infection stage, pulmonary stage and hyper-inflammation stage respectively. It is important to prevent lung or other organs injuries by preventing phase-II and phase-III via pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments. This was a case series study done on twenty-two patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients in this study have been used quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as supplements for 3 to 5 days during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid combination supplements on patients with COVID-19. The mean levels of WBC, ANC, ALC, AMC and AST were normal among all included patients before and after taking quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid supplements (P-value > 0.05). Quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily supplements were safe for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may prevent poor prognosis.

100,Hydrating the Respiratory Tract: An Alternative Explanation Why Masks Lower Severity of COVID-19 Disease,"Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFacemasks are the most widely used tool for mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased disease severity by the wearer has also been linked to the use of cloth facemasks. This well-documented finding is surprising considering that such masks are poor at filtering the smallest aerosol particles, which can reach the lower respiratory tract and have been associated with severe disease. We show that facemasks strongly increase the effective humidity of inhaled air, thereby promoting hydration of the respiratory epithelium which is known to be beneficial to the immune system. Increased humidity of inspired air could be an alternate explanation for the now well-established link between mask wearing and lower disease severity.",Adriaan Bax; Joseph M Courtney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248671,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248671,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
101,The experience of European hospital-based healthcare workers on following infection prevention and control procedures for COVID-19,"BackgroundWorking under pandemic conditions exposes health care workers (HCWs) to infection risk and psychological strain. Protecting the physical and psychological health of HCWs is a key priority. This study assessed the perceptions of European hospital HCWs of local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on their emotional wellbeing.

MethodsWe performed two rounds of an international cross-sectional survey, between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks (round 1), and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling (round 2). Main outcome measures were (1) behavioural determinants of HCW adherence with IPC procedures, (2) WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0-100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression.

Results2,289 HCWs (round 1: n=190, round 2: n=2,099) from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age of respondents was 42 ({+/-}11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n=1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n=527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value <.01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.8).

ConclusionsIn Europe, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on those providing direct COVID-19 patient care, junior staff and women.

102,Engineered CRISPR/Cas12a Enables Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP pre-amplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12aD156R, engineered chimeric DNA-extended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 L of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute pre-amplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.",Long T.

103,Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences in a national cohort in the United States,"In order to understand preferences about SARS-CoV-2 testing, we conducted a discrete choice experiment among 4793 participants in the Communities, Households, and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING COVID) Cohort Study from July 30-September 8, 2020. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of preferences related to testing and conducted a simulation to predict testing uptake if additional testing scenarios were offered. Five distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing emerged. ""Comprehensive testers"" (18.9%) ranked specimen type as most important and favored less invasive specimen types, with saliva most preferred, and also ranked venue and result turnaround time as highly important, with preferences for home testing and fast result turnaround time. ""Fast track testers"" (26.0%) ranked result turnaround time as most important and favored immediate and same day turnaround time. ""Dual testers"" (18.5%) ranked test type as most important and preferred both antibody and viral tests. ""Non-invasive dual testers"" (33.0%) ranked specimen type and test type as similarly most important, preferring cheek swab specimen type and both antibody and viral tests. ""Home testers"" (3.6%) ranked venue as most important and favored home-based testing. By offering less invasive (saliva specimen type), dual testing (both viral and antibody tests), and at home testing scenarios in addition to standard testing scenarios, simulation models predicted that testing uptake would increase from 81.7% to 98.1%. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing and found that offering additional testing options, which consider this heterogeneity, would likely increase testing uptake.

SIGNIFICANCEDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic testing has allowed for early detection of cases and implementation of measures to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding individuals preferences about testing and the service models that deliver tests are relevant in efforts to increase and sustain uptake of SARS-CoV-2 testing, which, despite vaccine availability, will be required for the foreseeable future. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a discrete choice experiment among a large national cohort of adults in the US. Offering additional testing options that account for or anticipate this heterogeneity in preferences (e.g., both viral and antibody tests, at home testing), would likely increase testing uptake.

104,Spotlight on the dark figure: Exhibiting dynamics in the case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections in Germany,"The case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections varies over time due to changing testing capacities, modified testing strategies and also, apparently, due to the dynamics in the number of infected itself. In this paper we investigate these dynamics by jointly looking at the reported number of detected COVID-19 infections with non-fatal and fatal outcomes in different age groups in Germany. We propose a statistical approach that allows us to spotlight the case detection ratio and quantify its changes over time. With this we can adjust the case counts reported at different time points so that they become comparable. Moreover we can explore the temporal development of the real number of infections, shedding light on the dark number. The results show that the case detection ratio has increased and, depending on the age group, is four to six times higher at the beginning of the second wave compared to what it was at the peak of the first wave. The true number of infection in Germany in October was considerably lower as during the peak of the first wave, where only a small fraction of COVID-19 infections were detected. Our modelling approach also allows quantifying the effects of different testing strategies on the case detection ratio. The analysis of the dynamics in the case detection rate and in the true infection figures enables a clearer picture of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Marc Schneble; Giacomo De Nicola; Goeran Kauermann; Ursula Berger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248763,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248763,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True

We investigated the incubation period of COVID-19 with regard to age, biological sex, location, and severity of the disease. Based on the data extracted, we report an overall mean and median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.894 days and 5.598 days, respectively. The incubation period did not statistically vary for biological sex or age, but some studies suggest a longer incubation period in the young and elderly. Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei Province of China may have a shorter incubation period for COVID-19 but the shorter incubation period may be due to an increase in viral load. In studying coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS, researchers have discovered an inverse relationship between incubation period length and virus severity.

106,REAL-TIME MECHANISTIC BAYESIAN FORECASTS OF COVID-19 MORTALITY,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late December 2019. In the first six months of the global outbreak, the US reported more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. Effective modeling of the course of the pandemic can help assist with public health resource planning, intervention efforts, and vaccine clinical trials. However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR model. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model and show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top 2 models out of 10 submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.",Graham C Gibson; Nicholas G Reich; Daniel Sheldon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248736,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248736,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
107,Unravelling the early warning capability of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19: A temporal study on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and need for the escalation,"Wastewater-based Epidemiological (WBE) surveillance offers a promising approach to assess the pandemic situation covering pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in highly populated area under limited clinical tests. In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N ([~]120%) and ORF 1ab ([~]38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September ([~]924.5 copies/ L) than August ([~]897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a [~] 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.

HIGHLIGHTS{square} Study unravels the early warning potential of wastewater based surveillance of COVID-19.
{square}Adequate SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected despite of limited reported case in the vicinity.
{square}Up to 2 weeks of lead is possible from a regular wastewater based COVID-19 surveillance.

MethodsWe recruited participants from Florida, Illinois, and Maryland ([~]1000/state) for an online survey September 16 - October 15, 2020. The survey covered demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and experiences around SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in the prior 2 weeks. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations with outcomes of interest.

ResultsOverall, 316 (10%) of 3,058 respondents wanted/needed a test in the two weeks prior to the survey. Of these, 166 (53%) were able to get tested and 156 (94%) received results; 53% waited [&ge;] 8 days to get results from when they wanted/needed a test. There were no significant differences by state. Among those wanting/needing a test, getting tested was significantly less common among men (aOR: 0.46) and those reporting black race (aOR: 0.53) and more common in those reporting recent travel (aOR: 3.35).

ConclusionsThere is an urgent need for a national communication strategy on who should get tested and where one can get tested. Additionally, measures need to be taken to improve access and reduce turn-around-time.",Steven J. Clipman; Amy Wesolowski; Shruti H. Mehta; Smisha Agarwal; Sarah E. Cobey; Derek A.T.

109,Forecasting intensive care unit demand during the COVID-19 pandemic: A spatial age-structured microsimulation model,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk of overburdening health care systems, and in particular intensive care units (ICUs). Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), ranging from wearing masks to (partial) lockdowns have been implemented as mitigation measures around the globe. However, especially severe NPIs are used with great caution due to their negative effects on the economy, social life and mental well-being. Thus, understanding the impact of the pandemic on ICU demand under alternative scenarios reflecting different levels of NPIs is vital for political decision-making on NPIs.

ObjectiveThe aim is to support political decision-making by forecasting COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID-19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. Substantial sub-national variation in COVID-19-related ICU demand requires a spatially disaggregated approach. This should not only take sub-national variation in ICU-relevant disease dynamics into account, but also variation in the population at risk including COVID-19-relevant risk characteristics (e.g. age), and factors mitigating the pandemic. The forecast provides indications for policy makers and health care stakeholders as to whether mitigation measures have to be maintained or even strengthened to prevent ICU demand from exceeding supply, or whether there is leeway to relax them.

MethodsWe implement a spatial age-structured microsimulation model of the COVID-19 pandemic by extending the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework. The model accounts for regional variation in population age structure and in spatial diffusion pathways. In a first step, we calibrate the model by applying a genetic optimization algorithm against hospital data on ICU patients with COVID-19. In a second step, we forecast COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID 19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. We apply the model to Germany and provide state-level forecasts over a 2-month period, which can be updated daily based on latest data on the progression of the pandemic.

ResultsTo illustrate the merits of our model, we present here ""forecasts"" of ICU demand for different stages of the pandemic during 2020. Our forecasts for a quiet summer phase with low infection rates identified quite some variation in potential for relaxing NPIs across the federal states. By contrast, our forecasts during a phase of quickly rising infection numbers in autumn (second wave) suggested that all federal states should implement additional NPIs. However, the identified needs for additional NPIs varied again across federal states. In addition, our model suggests that during large infection waves ICU demand would quickly exceed supply, if there were no NPIs in place to contain the virus.

ConclusionOur results provide evidence for substantial spatial variation in (1) the effect of the pandemic on ICU demand, and (2) the potential and need for NPI adjustments at different stages of the pandemic. Forecasts with our spatial age-structured microsimulation model allow to take this spatial variation into account. The model is programmed in R and can be applied to other countries, provided that reliable data on the number of ICU patients infected with COVID-19 are available at sub-national level.",Sebastian Kluesener; Ralf Schneider; Matthias Rosenbaum-Feldbruegge; Christian Dudel; Elke Loichinger; Nikola Sander; Andreas Backhaus; Emanuele Del Fava; Janina Esins; Martina Fischer; Linus Grabenhenrich; Pavel Grigoriev; Andre Grow; Jason Hilton; Bastian Koller; Mikko Myrskyla; Francesco Scalone; Martin Wolkewitz; Emilio Zagheni; Michael M.

It focuses on the spread dynamics between Phase I (from March 23th to May 31st, 2020) and II (from June 1st to August 22th, 2020) of the social distancing measures. It also examines municipal-level factors associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic. The analysis of the geographic pattern of the pandemic via Space-Time Scan Statistics (SaTScan) revealed fast spread among municipalities. During Phase I, clusters of infections and deaths were mainly located at the center of the country, while in Phase II, these clusters dispersed to the rest of the country. The regression results from the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression analysis suggested that income inequality, prevalence of obesity and diabetes, and concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) are strongly positively associated to confirmed cases and deaths regardless of lockdown.",Francisco Benita; Francisco Gasca-Sanchez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248716,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248716,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
111,On an optimal testing strategy for workplace settings operating during the COVID-19 pandemic,"High quality daily testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in workplace settings has become part of the standard and mandatory protection measures implemented widely in response to the current pandemic. Such tests are often limited to a small fraction of the attending personnel due to cost considerations, limited availability and processing capabilities and the often cumbersome requirements of the test itself. A maximally efficient use of such an important and frequently scarce resource is clearly required. We here present an optimal testing strategy which minimises the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic members of the population, derived under a series of simplifying assumptions, which however retain many of the generalities of the problem and yield robust results, as verified through a number of numerical simulations. We show that reduction in overall infected-person-days, IPD, by significant percentages can be achieved, for fixed numbers of tests per day of 5% and 10% of the population, of 30% and 50% in the IPD numbers, respectively.",Xavier Hernandez; Sergio Valentinotti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248752,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248752,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
112,"""There's No Place Like Home for The Holidays:"" Travel and SARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity Following Thanksgiving Weekend","In the US, public health officials discouraged travel and social gatherings for Thanksgiving. Data suggests that many individuals did travel over the holidays, albeit in smaller numbers than previous years. Using an online panel survey of individuals across ten US states, we found that many individuals reported spending Thanksgiving outside of their home (25.9%) or at home with at least one non-household member (27.3%). Among those who were tested, those who had Thanksgiving outside their home were significantly more likely to self-report a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior two weeks compared to those who had Thanksgiving at home with non-household members or with household members only (41.7% vs. 21.4% and 13.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Persons who had Thanksgiving outside their home and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 participated in a median 35 (IQR: 21 - 53). non-essential activities compared to those who had Thanksgiving at home and tested positive (median 3 activities, IQR 0-13). Notably, planned travel over the December holidays was most common among those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the prior 2 weeks (66.5%) compared with 25.4% of those who tested negative in the prior 2 weeks and 11.0% among those who were not tested. While public health authorities should continue promoting messages to dissuade travel and social gatherings over the holidays, as supported by these data, it is equally important to promote messaging on how to get together in a ""low-risk"" manner for those who travel and plan gatherings. In particular, it is critical that those who do travel or visit with others outside their household do so cautiously and avoid or significantly minimize all other activities where they may potentially acquire and transmit infection in the weeks prior to and after their visit.",Shruti H.

113,HLA-C* 04:01 is a Genetic Risk Allele for Severe Course of COVID-19,"BackgroundSince the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been increasing demand to identify predictors of severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study using HLA sequencing with subsequent independent validation.

MethodsWe analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19 were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts (n=240).

ResultsWe identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036). Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis.

ConclusionsHLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify high-risk patients and individualize management.",January Weiner III; Phillip Suwalski; Manuel Holtgrewe; Charlotte Thibeault; Melina Mueller; Dimitri Patriki; Claudia Quedenau; Ulrike Krueger; Elisa Theresa Helbig; Lena Lippert; Paula Stubbemann; Luis Miguel Real; Juan Macias Sanchez; Juan A.

114,Inferring Toll-Like Receptor induced epitope subunit vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2: A Reverse Vaccinology approach,"Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are a group of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) which bind to the exogenous pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like other PRRs; hence the main function is to sense the harmness and mediate the innate immune response to pathogens. TLRs play an important role in innate immune responses to infection. The host has evolved to use other TLR and PAMP agonists as agents to stimulate a protective inflammatory immune response against infection. Because only a small number of doses are given, TLR agonists appear to have greater potential and fewer safety concerns than other uses as vaccine adjuvants. In the present days, development of peptides targeting immune response can be approved for survival in biological monitoring systems before vaccine exposures. Peptide vaccines are easy to synthesize, more stable and relatively safe. In addition, production of peptides becomes simple, easily reproducible, fast and cost effective. Getting vaccinated against Covid-19, which has become a pandemic in the human population, is the most practical way to control the outbreak. The new coronavirus does not contain a drug or vaccine to prevent it from spreading to humans. To getting a proper vaccine candidate against the novel coronavirus, the present study used the reverse vaccinology approach by using a complete set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; such as: Spike, Envelope, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, NSPs, and ORFs to extract the antigenic elements that produce B-cell, T-cell and IFN positive epitopes. These epitopes with precise binding to the Toll-Like receptors (1-10) have developed epitope based vaccine candidates. We have prioritized a set of epitopes based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, sequence conservation and projected population coverage world-wide. The selected epitopes were employed for in-silico docking interactions with Toll-Like receptors and molecular dynamic simulation confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidates resulting epitope of spike proteins with both the TLR 7 and 8 shows the best binding affinity. We believe that this ideal epitope vaccine candidate could enhance the immune response of the host and reduce the reinfection risk.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424322,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424322,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,False

Drug combination strategies of repurposed drugs offer a number of advantages to monotherapies including the potential to achieve greater efficacy, the potential to increase the therapeutic index of drugs and the potential to reduce the emergence of drug resistance. Combination of agents with antiviral mechanisms of action with immune-modulatory or anti-inflammatory drug is also worthy of investigation. Here, we report on the in vitro synergistic interaction between two FDA approved drugs, remdesivir (RDV) and ivermectin (IVM) resulting in enhanced antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19.

116,SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification using droplet digital RT-PCR,"Quantitative viral load assays have transformed our understanding of - and ability to manage - viral diseases. They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), yield semi-quantitative results only. Reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), a technology that partitions each reaction into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets prior to amplification, offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. We evaluated eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for use in RT-ddPCR, and identified three (Charite-Berlin E-Sarbeco and Pasteur Institute IP2 and IP4) as the most efficient, precise and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. Analytical efficiency of the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set, for example, was ~83%, while assay precision, as measured by the coefficient of variation, was ~2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo. We further calibrated RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers against cycle threshold (Ct) values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform. The resulting log-linear relationship can be used to mathematically derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers from Ct values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology.",Natalie N.

117,Combined RT-qPCR and Pyrosequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Polybasic Cleavage Motif Uncovers Rare Pediatric COVID-19 Spectrum Diseases of Unusual Presentation,"BackgroundSurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is essential for the global containment measures with regard to the ongoing pandemic. Diagnostic gold standard is currently reverse transcription of the (+)RNA genome and subgenomic RNAs and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens, we propose the combination of the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This extension might add important value mainly in cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results.s

ResultsWe successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics or for epidemiologic studies. This allows a more reliable interpretation of conflicting RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR (CT values >30). After laboratory implementation and characterization of a best practice protocol we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 6 previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 associated diseases, partially exhibiting unusual and heterogeneous presentation. Moreover, it is notable that in the course of RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing method establishment we did not observe any case of false-positive diagnosis when confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were used from foregoing routine testing.

ConclusionsThe proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. Combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing does not negatively affect preceding RT-qPCR pipeline in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and can be optionally applied in routine to inspect conflicting RT-qPCR results.",Patrick Philipp Weil; Jacqueline Hentschel; Frank Schult; Anton Pembaur; Beniam Ghebremedhin; Olivier Mboma; Andreas Heusch; Anna-Christin Reuter; Daniel Mueller; Stefan Wirth; Malik Aydin; Andreas C.

118,Identification of COVID-19-relevant transcriptional regulatory networks and associated kinases as potential therapeutic targets,"Identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and signaling networks involved in the response of host to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is a powerful approach that provides a systems biology view of gene expression programs involved in COVID-19 and may enable identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease. In this study, we combined a series of recently developed computational tools to identify transcriptional regulatory networks involved in the response of epithelial cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and particularly regulatory mechanisms that are specific to this virus. In addition, using network-guided analyses, we identified signaling pathways that are associated with these networks and kinases that may regulate them. The results identified classical antiviral response pathways including Interferon response factors (IRFs), interferons (IFNs), and JAK-STAT signaling as key elements upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to mock-treated cells. In addition, comparing SARS-Cov-2 infection of airway epithelial cells to other respiratory viruses identified pathways associated with regulation of inflammation (MAPK14) and immunity (BTK, MBX) that may contribute to exacerbate organ damage linked with complications of COVID-19.

119,No evidence for human monocyte-derived macrophage infection and antibody-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Vaccines are essential to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to protect the vulnerable population. However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in human macrophages. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.",Obdulio Garcia-Nicolas; Ferdinand Zettl; Gert Zimmer; Volker Thiel; Artur Summerfield,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423940,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423940,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
120,Host Cell Proteases Drive Early or Late SARS-CoV-2 Penetration,"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) that spread through human populations worldwide in early 2020. CoVs rely on host cell proteases for activation and infection. The trypsin-like protease TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, cathepsin L in endolysosomes, and furin in the Golgi have all been implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic processing. Whether SARS-CoV-2 depends on endocytosis internalization and vacuolar acidification for infectious entry remains unclear. Here, we examined the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 activation during the cell entry process in tissue culture. Using four cell lines representative of lung, colon, and kidney epithelial tissues, we found that TMPRSS2 determines the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. In TMPRSS2-positive cells, infection was sensitive to aprotinin, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, but not to SB412515, a drug that impairs cathepsin L. Infectious penetration was marginally dependent on endosomal acidification, and the virus passed the protease-sensitive step within 10 min. In a marked contrast, in TMPRSS2-negative cells cathepsin L and low pH were required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The cathepsin L-activated penetration occurred within 40-60 min after internalization and required intact endolysosomal functions. Importantly, pre-activation of the virus allowed it to bypass the need for endosomal acidification for viral fusion and productive entry. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other CoVs a strategy of differential use of host cell proteases for activation and infectious penetration. This study also highlights the importance of TMPRSS2 in dictating the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2.

SignificancePreventing SARS-CoV-2 spread requires approaches affecting early virus-host cell interactions before the virus enters and infects target cells. Host cell proteases are critical for coronavirus activation and infectious entry. Here, we reconcile apparent contradictory observations from recent reports on endosomal acidification and the role of furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L in the productive entry and fusion process of SARS-CoV-2. Investigating authentic virus in various cell types, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 developed the ability to use different entry pathways, depending on the proteases expressed by the target cell. Our results have strong implications for future research on the apparent broad tropism of the virus in vivo. This study also provides a handle to develop novel antiviral strategies aiming to block virus entry, as illustrated with the several drugs that we identified to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, some with low IC50.",Jana Koch; Zina M Uckeley; Patricio Doldan; Megan L Stanifer; Steeve Boulant; Pierre-Yves Lozach,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423906,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423906,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False

Recent work has shown that the human MARCH1, 2 and 8 are antiretroviral factors that target the Human Immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins by reducing their incorporation in the budding virions. Nevertheless, the dearth of information regarding the antiviral mechanism of this family of proteins necessitates further examination. In this study, using both the human MARCH proteins and their mouse homologues, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the antiretroviral mechanism of this family of proteins.

122,SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) Protein Interacts with PDZ-Domain-2 of Host Tight Junction Protein ZO1,"Newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic leading to severe respiratory disease in humans. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe respiratory dysfunction that leads to morbidity.

The dimeric form of the viral main protease is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein in 11 sites, including its own N and C-terminus. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography to characterize an immature form of the main protease. We propose that this form preludes the cis-cleavage of N-terminal residues within the dimer, leading to the mature active site. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the main protease bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during the formation of the tetramer. This quaternary form is also present in solution, suggesting a transitional state during the C-terminal trans-cleavage.

124,Discovery of Cyclic Peptide Ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein using mRNA Display,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to substantial morbidity, mortality and disruption globally. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the viral spike protein and affinity ligands to this surface protein have the potential for applications as antivirals and diagnostic reagents. Here, we describe the affinity selection of cyclic peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from three distinct libraries (in excess of a trillion molecules each) by mRNA display. We identified six high affinity molecules with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (15-550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could be used as an affinity reagent to detect spike protein in solution by ELISA, and the co-crystal structure of this molecule bound to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site, displacing a {beta}-strand near the C-terminus. Our findings provide key mechanistic insight into the binding of peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the ligands discovered in this work may find future use as reagents for diagnostic applications.",Alexander Norman; Charlotte Franck; Mary Christie; Paige Hawkins; Karishma Patel; Anneliese Ashhurst; Anupriya Aggarwal; Jason KK Low; Rezwan Siddiquee; Caroline Ashley; Megan Steain; James  A Triccas; Stuart Grant Turville; Joel Mackay; Toby Passioura; Richard J Payne,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424069,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424069,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
125,Platycodin D prevents both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by hindering membrane fusion,"An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to the global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat COVID-19, but there has been no natural product showing inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed mechanism. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Tai Young Kim; Sangeun Jeon; Youngho Jang; Lizaveta Gotina; Joungha Won; Yeon Ha Ju; Sunpil Kim; Minwoo Wendy Jang; Woojin Won; Mingu Gordon Park; Ae Nim Pae; Sunkyu Han; Seungtaek Kim; C.

126,mRNA vaccine CVnCoV protects non-human primates from SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines to meet a worldwide need. mRNA-based vaccines are the most promising technology for rapid and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and production. We have designed CVnCoV, a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated, sequence optimised mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that encodes for full length, pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein. Unlike other mRNA-based approaches, CVnCoV exclusively consists of non-chemically modified nucleotides and can be applied at comparatively low doses. Here we demonstrate that CVnCoV induces robust humoral and cellular responses in non-human primates (NHPs). Animals vaccinated with 8 g of CVnCoV were protected from challenge infection with SARS-CoV-2. Comprehensive analyses of pathological changes in challenged animals via lung histopathology and Computed Tomography (CT) scans gave no indication of enhanced disease upon CVnCoV vaccination. These results demonstrate safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of CVnCoV in NHPs that extend our previously published preclinical data and provide strong support for further clinical testing in ongoing phase 2b/3 efficacy studies.",Susanne Rauch; Karen E Gooch; Yper Hall; Francisco J Salguero; Mike J Dennis; Fergus V Gleeson; Debbie Harris; Catherine Ho; Holly E Humphries; Stephanie Longet; Didier Ngabo; Jemma Paterson; Emma L Rayner; Kathryn A Ryan; Sally Sharpe; Robert J Watson; Stefan O Mueller; Benjamin Petsch; Miles W Carroll,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424138,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424138,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False

However, the antibody persistence over 3 months post immunization and the long-term memory have been rarely reported. Here, we report that a ferritin nanoparticle based SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine induced in mice an efficient antibody response which lasts for at least 7 months post immunization. Significantly higher number of memory B cells were maintained and a significantly higher level of recall response was induced upon antigen challenge. Thus, we believe our current study provide the first information about the long-term antibody persistence and memory response of a COVID-19 vaccine.

128,"Development of a novel hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle for rapid in vitro screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies, antiviral drugs, and viral mutations","Timely development of vaccines and antiviral drugs are critical to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic 1-6. Current methods for validation of vaccine efficacy involve the use of pseudoviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) pseudotyped lentivirus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), to quantify neutralizing antibodies for blocking viral infection 7-14. The process of pseudovirus infection and quantification is time consuming and can take days to complete. In addition, pseudoviruses contain structural proteins not native to SARS-CoV-2, which may alter particle properties in receptor binding and responses to antibody neutralization 15. Here we describe the development of a new hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle (Ha-CoV-2) for rapid screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. Ha-CoV-2 is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle, composed of only SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a RNA genome derived from a fast expressing alphavirus vector 16. We demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can rapidly and robustly express reporter genes in target cells within 3-5 hours following viral entry. We further validate the Ha-CoV-2 system for rapid quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. In addition, we assembled a Ha-CoV-2 particle bearing the D614G mutant spike protein, and found that the mutation led to an approximately 200% increase in virion infectivity. These results demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can also be applied for rapid monitoring and quantification of viral mutations for effects on neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines.",Brian Hetrick; Sijia He; Linda D Chilin; Farhang Alem; Aarthi Narayanan; Alessandra Luchini; Tuanjie Li; Xuefeng Liu; Lance Liotta; Yuntao Wu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423965,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423965,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False

A single-dose 24-hour pharmacokinetic study in hamsters, a small animal model for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated that pulmonary delivery of TFF remdesivir can achieve plasma remdesivir and GS-441524 levels higher than the reported EC50s of both remdesivir and GS-441524 (in human epithelial cells) over 20 hours. The half-life of GS-4412524 following dry powder insufflation was about 7 hours, suggesting the dosing regimen would be twice daily administration. Although the remdesivir-Captisol(R) (80/20 w/w) formulation showed faster and greater absorption of remdesivir and GS-4412524 in the lung, remdesivir-leucine (80/20 w/w) exhibited a greater Cmax with shorter Tmax and lower AUC of GS-441524, indicating lower total drug exposure is required to achieve a high effective concentration against SAR-CoV-2.

130,Low vitamin K status predicts mortality in a cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"It has recently been hypothesised that Vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19. We aimed to test the hypothesis that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls; and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 140 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional Vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Fourty-three patients died within 90-days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low Vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.18).

131,Digital proximity tracing app notifications lead to faster quarantine in non-household contacts: results from the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort Study,"BackgroundDigital proximity tracing (DPT) apps may warn exposed individuals faster than manual contact tracing (MCT), leading to earlier interruption of transmission chains through quarantine. However, it is yet unclear whether these apps lead to a reduction in transmissions under real-world conditions. This study aimed at evaluating whether the SwissCovid DPT app is effective in warning close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and prompting them to quarantine earlier.

MethodsA population-based sample of adult index cases and close contacts identified through MCT and enrolled in the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort study were surveyed regarding use of the SwissCovid app and SARS-CoV-2 exposure setting. We analyzed ooutcomes related to app effectiveness and adherence (i.e., receipt and uploading of notification codes by index cases; receipt of app warnings and steps taken by close contacts). Furthermore, we performed adjusted time-to-event analyses stratified by exposure setting to estimate the effect of the app on time between relevant exposure and entering quarantine among close contacts.

FindingsWe included 393 index cases and 261 close contacts in the analysis. Among index cases using SwissCovid, 88% reported receiving and uploading a notification code in the app to trigger a warning among proximity contacts. Among close contacts using the app, 38% reported receiving an app warning due to the risk exposure. We found that non-household contacts who were notified by the app started quarantine at a median of 2 days after exposure, while those not notified started quarantine at a median of 3 days. In stratified multivariable analyses, app notified contacts had a greater probability of going into quarantine earlier than those without app notification (HR 1{middle dot}53, 95% CI 1{middle dot}15-2{middle dot}03).

InterpretationOur study showed that non-household contacts notified by the app started quarantine one day earlier than those not notified by the app. These findings constitute the first evidence that DPT may reach exposed contacts faster than MCT, leading to earlier quarantine and potential interruption of SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains.

132,Rapid COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Deep Learning of the Computerized Tomography Scans,"Several studies suggest that COVID-19 may be accompanied by symptoms such as a dry cough, muscle aches, sore throat, and mild to moderate respiratory illness. The symptoms of this disease indicate the fact that COVID-19 causes noticeable negative effects on the lungs. Therefore, considering the health status of the lungs using X-rays and CT scans of the chest can significantly help diagnose COVID-19 infection. Due to the fact that most of the methods that have been proposed to COVID-19 diagnose deal with the lengthy testing time and also might give more false positive and false negative results, this paper aims to review and implement artificial intelligence (AI) image-based diagnosis methods in order to detect coronavirus infection with zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to examine the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of people living with Spinal cord injury (SCI) towards COVID-19 and their psychological status during in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh.

SettingThe Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), two tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

MethodsFrom July to September 2020, a prospective, cross-sectional survey of SCI subjects, 13-78 years of age, carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. Data has been collected by face to face interview through a pretested, and language validated questionnaire on KAP and Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DASS). Ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively. As all the patients were previously living with Spinal cord injury (SCI), therefore, all the patients admitted/ attend SCI rehab centers were considered as SCI positive samples.

ResultsA total of 207 people with SCI responded, 87%were male, and 13% were female with mean age34.18{+/-}12.9 years. 33.8% was tetraplegic and 66.2% was paraplegic and 63.8% of them were diagnosed ASIA-A, with motor score 45.38{+/-}19.5, sensory score 97.2{+/-}52, SpO2 95.07{+/-}3.3, and Vo2max 35.7{+/-}3.7mL/kg/min. 178 people had at least one health issue. Overall knowledge score was 8.59{+/-}2.3 out of 12, depression 11.18{+/-}8, anxiety 7.72{+/-}5.1, and stress was 9.32{+/-}6.7 from a total of 21 scores each. There was a correlation between Knowledge and DASS with age (P<.05); and Knowledge with gender (P<.05), and education (P<.01). Binary logistic regression found a higher association of Knowledge and DASS with gender (OR 6.6, 6.6, .95, 6.6; P<.01); and young age (OR.418, P<.01), illiterate (OR3.81, P<.01), and rural people (OR.48, P<.05) with knowledge. A linear relation was noted between depression and anxiety scores (r.45, P<.01) and stress scores (r.58, P<.01). A positive attitude was reported for the majority of subjects. SCI Persons reported they and the caregiver followed health advisory in consulting health professionals (65.7%), isolation (63.8%), droplet precaution (87.4%), and hygiene (90.3%).

134,Bringing COVID-19 home for Christmas: a need for enhanced testing in healthcare institutions after the holidays,"Festive gatherings this 2020 holiday season threaten to cause a surge in new cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospitals and long-term care facilities are key hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks, and may be at elevated risk as patients and staff return from holiday celebrations in the community. Some settings and institutions have proposed fortified post-holiday testing regimes to mitigate this risk. We use an existing model to assess whether implementing a single round of post-holiday screening is sufficient to detect and manage holiday-associated spikes in COVID-19 introductions to the long-term care setting. We show that while testing early helps to detect cases prior to potential onward transmission, it likely to miss a substantial share of introductions owing to false negative test results, which are more probable early in infection. We propose a two-stage post-holiday testing regime as a means to maximize case detection and mitigate the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 outbreaks into the start of the new year. Whether all patients and staff should be screened, or only community-exposed patients, depends on available testing capacity: the former will be more effective, but also more resource-intensive.",David RM Smith; Audrey Duval; Jean Ralph Zahar; Lulla Opatowski; Laura Temime,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248460,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248460,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,True
135,"Airflow and air velocity measurements while playing wind instruments, with respect to risk assessment of a SARS-CoV-2 infection","Due to airborne transmission of infection with the coronavirus, the question arose as to how high the risk of spreading infectious particles can be while playing a wind instrument.

To contribute to this question and to help clarify the possible risks, we analyzed 14 wind instruments, first qualitative by making airflows visible while playing and second quantitative by measuring air velocities at three distances (1m, 1.5m and 2m) in direction of the instruments bell.

Measurements took place with wind instrumentalists of the Bamberg Symphony in their concert hall.

Our findings highlight that while playing all wind instruments no airflow escaping from the instruments - from the bell with brass instruments, from the mouthpiece, keyholes and bell with woodwinds - was measured beyond a distance of 1.5m from the instruments bell, regardless of volume, pitch or what was played. With that, air velocity while playing corresponded to the usual value of hall-like rooms, of 0.1 m/s. For air-jet woodwinds, alto flute and piccolo, significant air movements were seen close to their mouthpieces, which escaped directly into the room without passing through the instrument and therefore generating directed air movements.",Claudia Spahn; Anna Maria Hipp; Bernd Schubert; Marcus Rudolf Axt; Markus Stratmann; Christian Schmoelder; Bernhard Richter,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248234,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248234,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,True

We evaluated 529 blood samples and 1051 oronasopharyngeal swabs from 144 cancer patients and 73 HCWs and correlated with >200 clinical variables. In patients with solid cancers and HCWs, S1-reactive and neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detectable five months post-infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were detected, and CD4+ T-cell responses correlated with S1 antibody levels.

137,Dynamics of a dual SARS-CoV-2 strain co-infection on a prolonged viral shedding COVID-19 case: insights into clinical severity and disease duration,"ObjectivesA few molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 cases of symptomatic reinfection are currently known worldwide, with a resolved first infection followed by a second infection after a 48 to 142-day intervening period. We report a multiple-component study of a clinically severe and prolonged viral shedding COVID-19 case in a teenager Portuguese female. She had two hospitalisations, a total of 19 RT-PCR tests, mostly positive, and criteria for releasing from home isolation at the end of 97 days.

MethodsThe viral genome was sequenced in seven serial samples and in the diagnostic sample from an infected close relative. A human genome-wide array (>900K) was screened on the seven samples, and in vitro culture was conducted on isolates from three late samples.

ResultsThe patient had co-infection by two SARS-CoV-2 strains, affiliated in distinct clades and diverging by six variants. The 20A lineage was absolute at the diagnosis (shared with a cohabitating relative), but nine days later the 20B lineage had 3% frequency, and two months later the 20B lineage had 100% frequency. The 900K profiles confirmed the identity of the patient in the serial samples, and allowed us to infer that she had polygenic risk scores for hospitalization and severe respiratory disease within the normal distributions for a Portuguese population cohort.

ConclusionsThe early-on dynamic co-infection was the probable cause for the severity of COVID-19 in this otherwise healthy young patient, and for her prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding profile.",Nicole Pedro; Claudio N Silva; Ana C Magalhaes; Bruno Cavadas; Ana M Rocha; Ana C Moreira; Salome Gomes; Diogo Silva; Joana Sobrinho-Simoes; Angelica Ramos; Maria J Cardoso; Rita Filipe; Pedro Palma; Filipa Ceia; Susana Silva; Joao T Guimaraes; Antonio Sarmento; Veronica Fernandes; Luisa Pereira; Margarida Tavares,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248392,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248392,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,True
138,Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 extracted from critical material from swabs,"BackgroundIn consideration of the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 cases in several countries and the resulting demand for unbiased sequencing approaches, we performed a direct RNA sequencing experiment using critical oropharyngeal swab samples collected from Italian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the Palermo region in Sicily.

MethodsHere, we identified the sequences SARS-CoV-2 directly in RNA extracted from critical samples using the Oxford Nanopore MinION technology without prior cDNA retro-transcription.

ResultsUsing an appropriate bioinformatics pipeline, we could identify mutations in the nucleocapisid (N) gene, which have been reported previously in studies conducted in other countries.

ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, the technique used in this study has not been used for SARS-CoV-2 detection previously owing to the difficulties in the extraction of RNA of sufficient quantity and quality from routine oropharyngeal swabs.

Despite these limitations, this approach provides the advantages of true native RNA sequencing, and does not include amplification steps that could introduce systematic errors.

This study can provide novel information relevant to the current strategies adopted in SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing.

ResultsThis study included 2774 patients. The mortality rate of the COVID-19 positive group was 1.5% (n=42). Those who died had a higher median age (82.3[76.5-89.5] vs. 42.9[28.2-59.5] years old; P<0.0001), more likely to have baseline comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (P<0.0001). They were more frequently prescribed ACEI/ARBs at baseline, and steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine during admission (P<0.0001). They also had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher D-dimer, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that age, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, the use of ACEIs/ARBs and diuretics, and various laboratory tests remained significant predictors of mortality.

ConclusionsWe report that an association between ACEIs/ARBs with COVID-19 related mortality even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use. Patients with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting deranged clotting, renal and liver function, and increased tissue inflammation, and ACEI/ARB use have a higher mortality risk.

140,Macrolevel Association of COVID-19 with Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors in India,"ObjectiveGreater COVID-19 related mortality has been reported among persons with various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We performed an ecological study to determine the association of state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices.

MethodsWe obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics.

ResultsMore than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India at end November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearsons r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), literacy, NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r2=0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r2=0.32, 0.16) and healthcare related factors (r2=0.52, 0.38).

ConclusionsCOVID-19 disease burden and mortality in India is ecologically associated with greater state-level burden of NCDs and risk factors, especially obesity and diabetes.

KEY MESSAGESO_LIThere is significant state-level variability in COVID-19 cases and deaths in India.

141,"Is Fear of COVID-19 Higher among Food-Insecure Households? A Model-Based Study, Mediated by Perceived Stress among Iranian Populations","The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis accompanied with multiple psychological consequences. This cross-sectional study, conducted on 2871 Iranians, examines how food insecurity may be associated with fear of COVID-19. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, COVID-19 fear scale, Cohens Perceived Stress Scale, and Perceived Social Support Questionnaire were used in gathering data. Data analysis was done using SPSS 22 and Amos 22. The results showed that food insecurity has significantly positive direct and indirect (mediated by perceived stress) correlations with fear of COVID-19 (P<0.05). It was also shown that perceived social support could negatively affect fear of COVID-19, through food insecurity or perceived stress (P<0.05). Among women, the presence of a child under 5 had a significant direct impact on fear of COVID-19 (P<0.05). The crisis caused by COVID-19 highlights the need for increasing social resilience through developing and implementing appropriate food security strategies.

O_TEXTBOXStatement of Relevance

The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied with multiple psychological consequences (including the fear of COVID-19), and threatens the food security status of millions of people. In order to assess the food insecurity impact on fear of COVID-19, the present study was conducted on Iranian adults. The proposed model, constructed by structural equation modeling, indicated the direct and indirect effects of food insecurity on fear of COVID-19. It was also shown that perceived social support could affect the fear of COVID-19 through food insecurity or perceived stress. It is concluded that food insecurity imposes further mental burdens during the pandemic, and policymakers should strengthen social resilience against its inter-related health consequences.

142,"Modeling effectiveness of testing strategies to prevent COVID-19 in nursing homes--United States, 2020","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes can be large with high case fatality. Identifying asymptomatic individuals early through serial testing is recommended to control COVID-19 in nursing homes, both in response to an outbreak (""outbreak testing"" of residents and healthcare personnel) and in facilities without outbreaks (""non-outbreak testing"" of healthcare personnel). The effectiveness of outbreak testing and isolation with or without non-outbreak testing was evaluated.

MethodsUsing published SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameters, the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions prevented through serial testing (weekly, every three days, or daily) and isolation of asymptomatic persons compared to symptom-based testing and isolation was evaluated through mathematical modeling using a Reed-Frost model to estimate the percentage of cases prevented through either outbreak testing alone or outbreak plus non-outbreak testing. The potential effect of simultaneous decreases (by 10%) in the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals when instituting testing strategies was also evaluated.

ResultsModeling suggests that outbreak testing could prevent 54% (weekly testing with 48-hour test turnaround) to 92% (daily testing with immediate results and 50% relative sensitivity) of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Adding non-outbreak testing could prevent up to an additional 8% of SARS-CoV-2 infections (depending on test frequency and turnaround time). However, added benefits of non-outbreak testing were mostly negated if accompanied by decreases in infection control practice.

ConclusionsWhen combined with high-quality infection control practices, outbreak testing could be an effective approach to preventing COVID-19 in nursing homes, particularly if optimized through increased test frequency and use of tests with rapid turnaround.",Isaac See; Prabasaj Paul; Rachel Slayton; Molly Steele; Matthew Stuckey; Lindsey Duca; Arjun Srinivasan; Nimalie Stone; John A Jernigan; Sujan Reddy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248255,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248255,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
143,Are college campuses superspreaders? A data-driven modeling study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present enormous challenges for colleges and universities and strategies for save reopening remain a topic of ongoing debate. Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.",Hannah Lu; Cortney Weintz; Joseph Pace; Dhiraj Indana; Kevin Linka; Ellen Kuhl,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248490,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248490,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
144,"Mental Disorder Prevalence Among Populations Impacted by Coronavirus Pandemics: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Study of COVID-19, MERS & SARS","Coronavirus pandemics are associated with a number of well-documented threats, stressors and traumas that vary by impacted population and contribute to mental disorders. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics, we investigated whether mental disorder prevalence: (a) was elevated among populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics (relative to unselected populations reported in the literature), and (b) varied by disorder (undistinguished psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare provider, quarantined). From 60 publications (N=66,190 participants), 725 individual estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. Across disorder and population, the median summary point prevalence was 20% (95%CI=17-25%). Prevalence estimates were generally substantially higher than reported by prior research for unselected samples. Psychiatric morbidity and PTSD were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults. Notably high prevalence was found for (a) psychiatric morbidity, PTSD and depression in infected/recovered adults (25-56%), (b) psychiatric morbidity and PTSD in healthcare providers (21-29%), (c) depression and PTSD in the adults in the community (15-19%), and (d) psychiatric morbidity in quarantined adults (28%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates were higher for studies/estimates: (1) focused on SARS or MERS versus COVID-19, (2) conducted in Hong Kong or Korea versus other locations, obtained (3) via questionnaire versus clinician assessment and (4) with standard versus non-standard scoring, and (5) of moderate or very low versus low quality.

145,Immune-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Severity and Chronicity Decoded Using Machine Learning,"Individuals with systemic symptoms long after COVID-19 has cleared represent approximately ~10% of all COVID-19 infected individuals. Here we present a bioinformatics approach to predict and model the phases of COVID so that effective treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 144 individuals including normal individuals and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum. We collected plasma and isolated PBMCs from 29 normal individuals, 26 individuals with mild-moderate COVID-19, 25 individuals with severe COVID-19, and 64 individuals with Chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine panel were run on all patients. Data was analyzed using machine learning methods to predict and distinguish the groups from each other.Using a multi-class deep neural network classifier to better fit our prediction model, we recapitulated a 100% precision, 100% recall and F1 score of 1 on the test set. Moreover, a first score specific for the chronic COVID-19 patients was defined as S1 = (IFN-{gamma} + IL-2)/ CCL4-MIP-1{beta}. Second, a score specific for the severe COVID-19 patients was defined as S2 = (10*IL-10 + IL-6) - (IL-2 + IL-8). Severe cases are characterized by excessive inflammation and dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While chronic patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract activated T cells.

146,An atlas connecting shared genetic architecture of human diseases and molecular phenotypes provides insight into COVID-19 susceptibility,"While genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) have successfully elucidated the genetic architecture of complex human traits and diseases, understanding mechanisms that lead from genetic variation to pathophysiology remains an important challenge. Methods are needed to systematically bridge this crucial gap to facilitate experimental testing of hypotheses and translation to clinical utility. Here, we leveraged cross-phenotype associations to identify traits with shared genetic architecture, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to accurately capture shared SNPs by proxy, and calculate significance of enrichment. This shared genetic architecture was examined across differing biological scales through incorporating data from catalogs of clinical, cellular, and molecular GWAS. We have created an interactive web database (interactive Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS database (iCPAGdb); http://cpag.oit.duke.edu) to facilitate exploration and allow rapid analysis of user-uploaded GWAS summary statistics. This database revealed well-known relationships among phenotypes, as well as the generation of novel hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of common diseases. Application of iCPAGdb to a recent GWAS of severe COVID-19 demonstrated unexpected overlap of GWAS signals between COVID-19 and human diseases, including with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis driven by the DPP9 locus. Transcriptomics from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that DPP9 was induced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls or those with bacterial infection. Further investigation of cross-phenotype SNPs with severe COVID-19 demonstrated colocalization of the GWAS signal of the ABO locus with plasma protein levels of a reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, CD209 (DC-SIGN), pointing to a possible mechanism whereby glycosylation of CD209 by ABO may regulate COVID-19 disease severity. Thus, connecting genetically related traits across phenotypic scales links human diseases to molecular and cellular measurements that can reveal mechanisms and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.",Liuyang Wang; Thomas J Balmat; Alejandro L Antonia; Florica J Constantine; Ricardo Henao; Thomas W Burke; Andy Ingham; Micah T McClain; Ephraim L Tsalik; Emily R Ko; Geoffrey Ginsburg; Mark DeLong; Xiling Shen; Christopher W Woods; Elizabeth R Hauser; Dennis C Ko,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248572,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
147,Kinetics of antibody responses dictate COVID-19 outcome,"Recent studies have provided insights into innate and adaptive immune dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, the exact feature of antibody responses that governs COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. Here, we analysed humoral immune responses in 209 asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-Spike (S) IgG levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. While high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time-dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than live discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed response, measured by anti-S, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, while sera from 89% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation prior to 14 days of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se, but rather with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.",Carolina Lucas; Jon Klein; Maria Sundaram; Feimei Lu; Patrick Wong; Julio Silva; Tianyang Mao; Ji Eun Oh; Maria Tokuyama; Peiwen Lu; Arvind Venkataraman; Annsea Park; Benjamin Israelow; Anne Wyllie; Chantal Vogels; M.

148,Cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with distinct transcriptomic changes within the heart,"1BackgroundAnalyses in hospitalized patients and small autopsy series suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect the heart. We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19.

MethodsLeft ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected. RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS- CoV-2 and its replication in the heart. A virus load >1000 copies per {micro}g RNA was defined as relevant. Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 age-matched cases without cardiac infection.

ResultsA relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased (43%). The median cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per {micro}g RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In situ hybridization revealed SARS- CoV-2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells. Virus detection was not associated with increased inflammatory cells. Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of the entry factor TMPRSS2. Cardiac virus replication was found in 14/95 hearts (15%). Remarkably, cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death. RNA sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction of cardiomyocytes. Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term ""extracellular exosomes"".

149,Identifying Sequential Complication and Mortality Patterns in Diabetes Mellitus: Comparisons of Machine Learning Methodologies,"BackgroundDiabetes mellitus-related complications adversely affect the quality of life. Better risk-stratified care through mining of sequential complication patterns is needed to enable early detection and prevention.

MethodsUnivariable and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant variables that can predict mortality. A sequence analysis method termed Prefixspan was applied to identify the most common couple, triple, quadruple, quintuple and sextuple sequential complication patterns in the directed comorbidity pathology network. A knowledge enhanced CPT+ (KCPT+) sequence prediction model is developed to predict the next possible outcome along the progression trajectories of diabetes-related complications.

FindingsA total of 14,144 diabetic patients (51% males) were included. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without known ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (odds ratio [OR]: 2.8, 95% CI: [2.3, 3.4]), peripheral vascular disease (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: [1.9, 2.8]), dementia (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: [1.8, 2.4]), and IHD with AMI (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: [2.1, 2.6]) are the most important multivariate predictors of mortality. KCPT+ shows high accuracy in predicting mortality (F1 score 0.90, ACU 0.88), osteoporosis (F1 score 0.86, AUC 0.82), ophthalmological complications (F1 score 0.82, AUC 0.82), IHD with AMI (F1 score 0.81, AUC 0.85) and neurological complications (F1 score 0.81, AUC 0.83) with a particular prior complication sequence.

152,Population risk factors for severe disease and mortality in COVID-19: A global systematic review and meta-analysis,"AimCOVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases. While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsThe systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable.

ResultsSeventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR = 2.65 (1.81-3.90)), male sex (OR = 2.05(1.39-3.04)) and severe obesity (OR = 2.57 (1.31-5.05)). Active cancer (OR = 1.46 (1.04-2.04)) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles.

153,A New Extension of State-Space SIR Model to Account for Underreporting- An Application to the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida,"In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of infecteds are expected to remain undetected. Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they are expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, under the lack of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may be entirely different from that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be considered while estimating the parameters and forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic.

In this paper, we have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) -recovered-deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure.

154,Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on airplanes and high-speed trains,"Modern transportation plays a key role in the long-distance and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, little is known about the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on confined vehicles, such as airplanes and trains. Based on the itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts among 9,265 airline passengers on 291 airplanes and 29,335 passengers on 830 high-speed trains in China from December 20, 2019 to March 17, 2020, we estimated that the upper bound of overall attack rate of COVID-19 among passengers was 0.60% (95% confidence interval: 0.43%-0.84%) for airplanes and 0.35% (0.28%-0.44%) for trains departing from Wuhan before its lockdown, respectively. The reproduction number during travel ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 on airplanes and from 0.07 to 0.12 on trains, with the risk varying by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the difference in risk was not significant between the types of aircraft and train. Overall, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on planes and high-speed trains with high efficiency air filtration devices was relatively low.

155,Airborne Transmission of Virus-Laden Aerosols inside a Music Classroom: Effects of Portable Purifiers and Aerosol Injection Rates,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shifted attention to the airborne transmission of small exhaled droplet nuclei within indoor environments such as classrooms. The spread of aerosols through singing and musical instruments in music performances has necessitated the need for utilizing precautionary methods such as masks and portable purifiers. This study investigates the effects of placing portable air purifiers at different locations inside a classroom, as well as the effects of different aerosol injection rates (e.g., with and without masks, different musical instruments etc.). The time varying deposition of aerosols on the walls and the airborne aerosol concentration are analyzed in this study. It was found that proper placement of purifiers could offer a significant advantage in reducing airborne aerosol numbers (offering orders of magnitude higher aerosol removal when compared to having no purifiers, where the removal is sometimes nearly zero), while improper placement of the purifiers could worsen the situation. It was concluded that in general, the purifier should be placed as close to the injector as possible in order to yield a benefit, and also away from the people to be protected. Moreover, using purifiers could help in achieving ventilation rates close to the prescribed values by WHO, while also achieving aerosol removal times within the CDC recommended guidelines. This could help in deciding effective break periods between classroom sessions, which was found to be around 25 minutes through this study. The injection rate was found to have an almost linear correlation with the average airborne aerosol suspension rate and aerosol surface deposition rate, which could be used to predict the trends for scenarios with other injection rates.",Sai Ranjeet Narayanan; Suo Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248374,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248374,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

Here, we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) characterised by eight lineage-defining mutations in the spike protein, including three at important residues in the receptor-binding domain (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may have functional significance. This lineage emerged in South Africa after the first epidemic wave in a severely affected metropolitan area, Nelson Mandela Bay, located on the coast of the Eastern Cape Province. This lineage spread rapidly, becoming within weeks the dominant lineage in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape Provinces. Whilst the full significance of the mutations is yet to be determined, the genomic data, showing the rapid displacement of other lineages, suggest that this lineage may be associated with increased transmissibility.",Houriiyah Tegally; Eduan Wilkinson; Marta Giovanetti; Arash Iranzadeh; Vagner Fonseca; Jennifer Giandhari; Deelan Doolabh; Sureshnee Pillay; Emmanuel James San; Nokukhanya Msomi; Koleka Mlisana; Anne von Gottberg; Sibongile Walaza; Mushal Allam; Arshad Ismail; Thabo Mohale; Allison J Glass; Susan Engelbrecht; Gert Van Zyl; Wolfgang Preiser; Francesco Petruccione; Alex Sigal; Diana Hardie; Gert Marais; Marvin Hsiao; Stephen Korsman; Mary-Ann Davies; Lynn Tyers; Innocent Mudau; Denis York; Caroline Maslo; Dominique Goedhals; Shareef Abrahams; Oluwakemi Laguda-Akingba; Arghavan Alisoltani-Dehkordi; Adam Godzik; Constantinos Kurt Wibmer; Bryan Trevor Sewell; Jose Lourenco; Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara; Sergei L Kosakovsky Pond; Steven Weaver; Darren Martin; Richard J Lessells; Jinal N Bhiman; Carolyn Williamson; Tulio de de Oliveira,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248640,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248640,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
157,"CovidSIMVL -- Transmission Trees, Superspreaders and Contact Tracing in Agent Based Models of Covid-19","The agent-based model CovidSIMVL (github.com/ecsendmail/MultiverseContagion) is employed in this paper to delineate different network structures of transmission chains in simulated COVID-19 epidemics, where initial parameters are set to approximate spread from a single transmission source, and R0ranges between 1.5 and 2.5.

The resulting Transmission Trees are characterized by breadth, depth and generations needed to reach a target of 50% infected from a starting population of 100, or self-extinction prior to reaching that target. Metrics reflecting efficiency of an epidemic relate closely to topology of the trees.

It can be shown that the notion of superspreading individuals may be a statistical artefact of Transmission Tree growth, while superspreader events can be readily simulated with appropriate parameter settings. The potential use of contact tracing data to identify chain length and shared paths is explored as a measure of epidemic progression. This characterization of epidemics in terms of topological characteristics of Transmission Trees may complement equation-based models that work from rates of infection. By constructing measures of efficiency of spread based on Transmission Tree topology and distribution, rather than rates of infection over time, the agent-based approach may provide a method to characterize and project risks associated with collections of transmission events, most notably at relatively early epidemic stages, when rates are low and equation-based approaches are challenged in their capacity to describe or predict.

MOTIVATION - MODELS KEYED TO CONTEMPLATED DECISIONSOutcomes are altered by changing the processes that determine them. If we wish to alter contagion-based spread of infection as reflected in curves that characterize changes in transmission rates over time, we must intervene at the level of the processes that are directly involved in preventing viral spread. If we are going to employ models to evaluate different candidate arrays of localized preventive policies, those models must be posed at the same level of granularity as the entities (people enacting processes) to which preventive measures will be applied. As well, the models must be able to represent the transmission-relevant dynamics of the systems to which policies could be applied. Further, the parameters that govern dynamics within the models must embody the actions that are prescribed/proscribed by the preventive measures that are contemplated. If all of those conditions are met, then at a formal or structural level, the models are conformant with the provisions of the Law of Requisite Variety1 or the restated version of that law - the good regulator theorem.2

On a more logistical or practical level, the models must yield summary measures that are responsive to changes in key parameters, highlight the dynamics, quantify outcomes associated with the dynamics, and communicate that information in a form that can be understood correctly by parties who are adjudicating on policy options.

If the models meet formal/structural requirements regarding requisite variety, and the parameters have a plausible interpretation in relationship to real-world situations, and the metrics do not overly-distort the data contents that they summarize, then the models provide information that is directly relevant to decision-making processes. Models that meet these requirements will minimize the gap that separates models from decisions, a gap that will otherwise be filled by considerations other than the data used to create the models (for equation-based models) or the data generated by the simulations.

In this work, we present an agent-based model that targets information requirements of decision-makers who are setting policy at a local level, or translate population level directives to local entities and operations. We employ an agent-based modeling approach, which enables us to generate simulations that respond directly to the requirements of the good regulator theorem. Transmission events take place within a spatio-temporal frame of reference in this model, and rates are not conditioned by a reproduction rate (R0) that is specified a priori. Events are a function of movement and proximity. To summarize dynamics and associated outcomes of simulated epidemics, we employ metrics reflecting topological structure of transmission chains, and distributions of those structures. These measures point directly to dynamic features of simulated outbreaks, they operationalize the ""efficiency"" construct, and they are responsive to changes in parameters that govern dynamics of the simulations.",Ernie Chang; Kenneth Andrew Moselle; Ashlin Richardson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248673,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248673,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
158,"When might Host Heterogeneity Drive the Evolution of Asymptomatic, Pandemic Coronaviruses?","For most emerging infectious diseases, including SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pharmaceutical intervensions such as drugs and vaccines are not widely available, and disease surveillance followed by isolating, contact-tracing and quarantining infectious individuals is critical for controlling outbreaks. These interventions often begin by identifying symptomatic individuals. However, by actively removing pathogen strains likely to be symptomatic, such interventions may inadvertently select for strains less likely to result in symptomatic infections. Additionally, the pathogens fitness landscape is structured around a heterogeneous host pool. In particular, uneven surveillance efforts and distinct transmission risks across host classes can drastically alter selection pressures. Here we explore this interplay between evolution caused by disease control efforts, on the one hand, and host heterogeneity in the efficacy of public health interventions on the other, on the potential for a less symptomatic, but widespread, pathogen to evolve. We use an evolutionary epidemiology model parameterized for SARS-CoV-2, as the widespread potential for silent transmission by asymptomatic hosts has been hypothesized to account, in part, for its rapid global spread. We show that relying on symptoms-driven reporting for disease control ultimately shifts the pathogens fitness landscape and can cause pandemics. We find such outcomes result when isolation and quarantine efforts are intense, but insufficient for suppression. We further show that when host removal depends on the prevalence of symptomatic infections, intense isolation efforts can select for the emergence and extensive spread of more asymptomatic strains. The severity of selection pressure on pathogens caused by these interventions likely lies somewhere between the extremes of no intervention and thoroughly successful eradication. Identifying the levels of public health responses that facilitate selection for asymptomatic pathogen strains is therefore critical for calibrating disease suppression and surveillance efforts and for sustainably managing emerging infectious diseases.",Kenichi W.

MethodsA web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 13 to May 5, 2020. Adult residents of Greece anonymously completed an online survey that was distributed through email and social media. A total of 1396 fully complete questionnaires were collected. Demographic questions, questions regarding the knowledge about the disease etiology, diagnosis and prevention, and questions related to the respondents attitude and perception toward the restriction measures and the confidence in different kinds of institutions providing information were included in the survey items. The appropriate statistical analyses were conducted according to the type of variable and the research question.

ResultsThe highest knowledge scores were found in females (74.8%, p = 0.015), individuals over 60 years old (77.3%, p < 0.001) and individuals having completed post-secondary or tertiary education (76.5%, p < 0.001). Five attitude patterns toward the pandemic were identified: ""trust in institutions"", ""trust in the restriction measures"", ""trust in media and the internet"", ""trust in traditional institutions"", and ""measures deniers"".

160,Risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in Egyptian quarantine hospitals,"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Egypt adopted a unique care model based on quarantine hospitals for Covid-19 patients, with dedicated medical teams residing in the hospital days and nights during working shifts. However, the impact of this approach on the infection risk for healthcare workers (HCWs) is uncertain.

Based on data collected within two quarantine hospitals located in Cairo, Egypt, we compute the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers (HCWs) using a model-based approach that accounts for variability in false-negative rates of RT-PCR tests. We estimate the probability for an HCW to be infected at the end of a working shift at 12.8% (95% CrI: 7.6%-19.5%) for a 2- week shift at Hospital 1, whereas a higher probability of 48.2% (95%CrI: 23.8%-74.5%) was found for a 7-day shift at Hospital 2.

The large variation in the infection risk we describe between the two hospitals we studied suggests that HCWs from quarantine hospitals may face a high risk of infection, but that, with sufficient anticipation and infection control measures, this risk can be brought down to levels similar to those observed in standard healthcare settings.",Sofia Jijon; Ahmad Al Shafie; Laura Temime; Kevin Jean; Mohamed El Kassas; - the EMEA-MESuRS working group on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 modelling,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248594,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248594,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
161,Preventing a cluster from becoming a new wave in settings with zero community COVID-19 cases,"In settings with zero community transmission, any new SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are likely to be the result of random incursions. The level of restrictions in place at the time of the incursion is likely to considerably affect possible outbreak trajectories. We used an agent-based model to investigate the relationship between ongoing restrictions and behavioural factors, and the probability of an incursion causing an outbreak and the resulting growth rate. We applied our model to the state of Victoria, Australia, which has reached zero community transmission as of November 2020.

We found that a future incursion has a 45% probability of causing an outbreak (defined as a 7-day average of >5 new cases per day within 60 days) if no restrictions were in place, decreasing to 23% with a mandatory masks policy, density restrictions on venues such as restaurants, and if employees worked from home where possible. A drop in community symptomatic testing rates was associated with up to a 10-percentage point increase in outbreak probability, highlighting the importance of maintaining high testing rates as part of a suppression strategy.

Because the chance of an incursion occurring is closely related to border controls, outbreak risk management strategies require an integrated approaching spanning border controls, ongoing restrictions, and plans for response. Each individual restriction or control strategy reduces the risk of an outbreak. They can be traded off against each other, but if too many are removed there is a danger of accumulating an unsafe level of risk.

162,"COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine after September 1, 2020","BackgroundThe threats of the COVID-19 pandemic require the mobilization of scientists, including mathematicians. To understand how the number of cases increases versus time, various models based on direct observations of a random number of new cases and differential equations can be used. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches should also be used, for example, some smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic in different countries and regions and to make adequate predictions of the duration, hidden periods, reproduction numbers, and final sizes of its waves. In particular, seven waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated.

ObjectiveWe will detect new epidemic waves in Ukraine that occurred after September 1, 2020 and estimate the epidemic characteristics with the use of generalized SIR model. Some predictions of the epidemic dynamics will be presented.

MethodsIn this study we use the smoothing method for the dependence of the number of cases on time; the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before.

ResultsSeventh and eights epidemic waves in Ukraine were detected and the reasons of their appearance were discussed. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated. The prediction for the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine is not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June 2021. Only mass vaccination and social distancing can change this trend.

ConclusionsNew waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical simulations.

163,Optimal strategies for combining vaccine prioritization and social distancing to reduce hospitalizations and mitigate COVID19 progression,"Social distancing is an effective population-level mitigation strategy to prevent COVID19 propagation but it does not reduce the number of susceptible individuals and bears severe economic and psychological consequences. A vaccine has recently been developed but its deployment will be limited and not immediate. Designing an optimal combination of these two intervention strategies is a priority, but a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between these strategies is missing. To tackle this challenge we developed an age-structured deterministic model in which vaccines are deployed during the pandemic to individuals who, in the eye of public health, are susceptible (do not show symptoms). The model allows for flexible and dynamic prioritization strategies with shifts between target groups. We find that social distancing applied uniformly to all ages and with vaccination targeted towards adults (20-59) or elderly (60+) work in synergism but up to a threshold beyond which vaccination is not efficient. The inefficiency threshold can be eliminated by targeting social distancing at the age groups that are not vaccinated and the optimal strategy is to prioritize vaccines to elderly. Nevertheless, while vaccination reduces hospitalizations, it does not affect the time it takes to eliminate the virus from the population, which is affected only by social distancing. Finally, the same reduction in hospitalization can be achieved via different combination of strategies, giving decision makers flexibility in choosing public health policies. Our study provides insights into the factors that affect vaccination success and provides methodology to test different intervention strategies in a way that will align with ethical guidelines.",Sharon Guerstein; Victoria Romeo-Aznar; Ma'ayan Dekel; Oren Miron; Nadav Davidovitch; Rami Puzis; Shai Pilosof,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248622,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248622,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
164,COVID-19 control measure effects suggest excess winter mortality is more sensitive to infection control than warmer temperatures.,"BackgroundExcess winter mortality (EWM) has been attributed to both seasonal cold exposure, and to infectious disease. In 2020, New Zealands border management and lockdown measures successfully eliminated community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and also largely eliminated influenza and many other respiratory viruses. This study investigates the contribution of infections and temperature to EWM and typical extended winter (May to October) deaths in this natural experiment created by New Zealands COVID-19 pandemic response.

MethodsWe used age-standardised weekly deaths to measure EWM 2011 to 2019, then used historical patterns to estimate high, medium and low scenario 2020 EWMs. We then modelled typical year and 2020 heating degree day: mortality relationships to estimate relative contributions of cold temperature and infection to typical EWEDs.

ResultsEWM 2011 to 2019 averaged 14.7% (low 11.4%, high 20.9%). In contrast, 2020 EWM was estimated at 1.6%, 2.7%, or 3.8% under high, medium, and low spring-summer mortality scenarios. Between 2011 and 2019, temperature was estimated to explain 47% of extended winter deaths, and infection 27%, with the remaining 26% attributable to the interaction between infection and temperature.

DiscussionThe society-wide response to COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in a major reduction of winter mortality in this high-income nation with a temperate climate. In addition to influenza, other respiratory pathogens likely also make a significant contribution to EWM. Low cost protection measures such as mask wearing (eg, in residential care facilities), discouragement of sick presenteeism, and increased influenza vaccine coverage, all have potential to reduce future winter mortality.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSExcess winter mortality (EWM) is a widely observed phenomenon, commonly attributed to physiological responses to short and long-term outdoor and indoor cold exposure (and associated increased air pollution); other seasonal physiology changes; and higher incidence of some infectious diseases. Previous estimates of EWM in New Zealand range from 10.3% to 25.6%, with influenza estimated to make up roughly a third of that excess. Internationally, deaths attributable to cold temperatures are also found outside the traditional winter period, with influenza making a large contribution to cold temperature deaths.

Added value of this studyThis study finds that following a successful COVID-19 elimination strategy, which simultaneously prevented the annual winter influenza season, and likely other winter respiratory infections, New Zealand is likely in 2020 to experience less than a third of the usual winter mortality excess. Further, this study for the first time estimates the relative contributions of cold temperature and infection, and the interaction between the two, to New Zealand winter deaths. We estimate that of the 9.5% fewer deaths than in typical years recorded between 1 May and 31 October 2020, 92.5% were prevented by infection control measures; 1.4% by the 1.14{degrees}C warmer than average winter; and 6.1% by the interaction between infection and low temperature.

Implications of all the available evidenceInfluenza and other infectious respiratory pathogens appear to make a much larger contribution to winter mortality than previously recognised. Low cost protection measures such as mask wearing (eg, in residential care facilities), discouragement of sick presenteeism, and increased influenza vaccine coverage, all have potential to reduce future winter deaths, and lower overall annual mortality rates.",Lucy Telfar-Barnard; Michael G Baker; Amanda Kvalsvig; Nick Wilson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248531,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248531,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
165,How optimal allocation of limited testing capacity changes epidemic dynamics,"Insufficient testing capacity continues to be a critical bottleneck in the worldwide fight against COVID-19. Optimizing the deployment of limited testing resources has therefore emerged as a keystone problem in pandemic response planning. Here, we use a modified SEIR model to optimize testing strategies under a constraint of limited testing capacity. We define pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic infected classes, and assume that positively tested individuals are immediately moved into quarantine. We further define two types of testing. Clinical testing focuses only on the symptomatic class. Non-clinical testing detects pre- and asymptomatic individuals from the general population, and an ""information"" parameter governs the degree to which such testing can be focused on high infection risk individuals. We then solve for the optimal mix of clinical and non-clinical testing as a function of both testing capacity and the information parameter. We find that purely clinical testing is optimal at very low testing capacities, supporting early guidance to ration tests for the sickest patients. Additionally, we find that a mix of clinical and non-clinical testing becomes optimal as testing capacity increases. At high but empirically observed testing capacities, a mix of clinical testing and unfocused (information=0) non-clinical testing becomes optimal. We further highlight the advantages of early implementation of testing programs, and of combining optimized testing with contact reduction interventions such as lockdowns, social distancing, and masking.",Justin M Calabrese; Jeffery Demers,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248431,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248431,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

Materials and MethodsIn this modelling exercise, we extracted the number of daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Okinawa from October 1 to November 30, 2020 and explored possible scenarios for decreasing COVID-19 incidence by combining population-wide screening and/or social distancing policy.

ResultsWe reveal that permanent lockdown can be replaced by mass testing that mobilizes sufficient target population at an adequate frequency. In addition, solely imposing a circuit breaker will not bring a favorable outcome in the long-term, and mass testing presents implications for minimizing a period of lockdown.

169,Routine SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance results in Turkey to follow Covid-19 outbreak,"1.A global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) declared by WHO in March 2019 is still ongoing. As of 13th of December 2020, 70 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 1.5 million people lost their lives globally (WHO, 2020). Since March 2019, diagnosis of Covid-19 cases has been done through PCR test of samples from nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. However, in March 2019, it was reported that the faeces [1] and urine [2] of all infected people contain SARS-CoV-2. Later, numerous researchers [3-7] detected SARS-CoV-2 in faeces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Moreover, some studies [1,4,8-12] suggested the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces after the patients respiratory samples tested negative. In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), i.e., wastewater surveillance, aiming to estimate the distribution of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a specific region has received worldwide attention. Various research groups worldwide [1, 13-54] have started SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater since WBE provides tracking whole population by testing a small number of wastewater samples in a specific region and can predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human faeces a few days to a week before onset of symptoms. This makes WBE quite economic tool for continual tracking of decreasing or increasing trend of the Covid-19 in a particular region. However, up to date, almost all of the WBE studies have been performed with samples from a few treatment plants. There was no reported nationwide wastewater surveillance study that has been integrated into a national Covid-19 management strategy by decision makers. Nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies have great potential to reflect the actual distribution of Covid-19 cases in a community by accounting not only symptomatic patients tested but also asymptomatic patients having no or mild symptoms and not been tested. As opposed to clinical surveillance studies, wastewater-based surveillance studies will reflect the number of cases in a community by testing one sample from a treatment plant serving this community instead of performing individual swab tests.

Turkey, which is among the few countries that started wastewater based surveillance studies at the early stages of pandemic is a leading country, performing a nationwide surveillance study. The distribution of Covid-19 cases throughout the country via SARS-CoV-2 measurements in influent, effluent and sludge samples of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in 81 cities through May 2020-June 2020 was conducted [36, 51, 52]. In June 2020, nationwide routine sampling through 22 regional identified cities has been started. However, from June to September 2020 all samples were detected negative due to problems with RT-pCR primer targeting RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Since September 2020, routine sampling from 22 cities of Turkey with 2 weeks sampling period (weekly for mega city Istanbul) has been continued and regional Covid-19 distributions have been reported as viral loads on color-scale maps. To the best our knowledge, this is the first routine nationwide surveillance study indicating Covid-19 distribution regularly using color-scale presentation on a map.",Bilge Alpaslan Kocamemi; Halil Kurt; Ahmet Sait; Hamza Kadi; Fahriye Sarac; Ismail Aydin; Ahmet Mete Saatci; Bekir Pakdemirli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248586,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248586,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
170,"SARS-CoV-2 infections in people with PCD: neither frequent, nor particularly severe","People with pre-existing chronic health conditions are reportedly at high risk of getting the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and of having a severe disease course but little data exist on rare diseases such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). We studied risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections among people with PCD using data from the COVID-PCD, a participatory study that collects data in real-time directly from people with PCD. Data was collected using online questionnaires. A baseline questionnaire collected information on demographic data, information about the PCD diagnosis and severity. A short weekly questionnaire collected information about current symptoms and incident SARS-CoV-2 infections. 578 people participated in the COVID-PCD by December 7, 2020, with a median number of follow-up weeks of 9 (interquartile range: 4-19 weeks). 256 (45%) of the participants had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 12 tested positive prior to study entry or during study follow up (2.1% of the total included population, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-3.6%). 4 people tested positive during the study follow-up, corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.5 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.9-6.5). Overall, reported severity was mild with two reporting no symptoms, eight reporting mild symptoms, one reporting severe symptom without hospitalisation, and one reporting hospitalisation for 9 days. The study suggests that with careful personal protection, people with PCD do not seem to have an increased risk of infection with SARS-COV-2, nor an especially severe disease course.",Eva Sophie Lunde Pedersen; Myrofora Goutaki; Amanda Harris; Lucy Dixon; Michele Manion; Bernhard Rindlisbacher; - COVID-PCD patient advisory group; Jane S Lucas; Claudia E Kuehni,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248420,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248420,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

173,Changes in hospital prescribing activity at a specialist children's hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic - an observational study,"ObjectiveTo compare hospital activity, patient casemix and medication prescribing and administration before and during the COVID-19 emergency.

DesignRetrospective observational study

SettingA specialist childrens hospital in the UK

PatientsInpatients aged 25 and younger treated at a specialist childrens hospital between 29 April 2019 and 6 September 2020

ResultsThere were 21,471 day cases and inpatients treated during the 16 month study period. Day cases (no overnight stay) dropped by around 37% per week. Both admissions and discharges for inpatients (at least one overnight stay) decreased leading to a small reduction in hospital bed days but no reduction in hospital bed nights. The effect on hospital activity on different patient groups varied substantially with some groups such as medical oncology day cases increasing by 13%. As a result, the patient case mix in the hospital was very different during the pandemic. Overall weekly medication administrations decreased for day cases and inpatients, but weekly medication administrations per bed day increased by 10% for day cases and 6% for inpatients.

ConclusionsDespite not being badly affected by the disease itself, specialist paediatric hospital services have been greatly affected by the pandemic. The average number of medications per inpatient bed day increased, likely reflecting changes to the patient population, with only those children with severe conditions being treated during the pandemic. These data demonstrate the complex pattern of implications on specialist services and provide evidence for planning the impact of future emergencies and resolution strategies.",Emma Vestesson; Carlos Alonso; John Booth; Neil J Sebire; Adam Steventon; Steve Tomlin; Joseph F Standing,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248153,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248153,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

Mount Sinai Hospital is in New York City (NYC), an early epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic during the study period. Among 43,963 singleton births, we observed no difference in either outcome after the implementation of lockdown measures when compared to the same trends in prior years (p=0.09-0.35). Of interest, we observed a statistically significant decrease in premature births after NYC phase one reopening compared to those of the same time period in 2012-2019 across all time windows (p=0.0028-0.049), and a statistically significant decrease in NICU admissions over the largest time window (2.75 months) compared to prior years (p=0.0011).",Felix S Richter; Arielle S Strasser; Mayte Suarez Farinas; Shan Zhao; Girish Nadkarni; Ethylin Wang Jabs; Katherine Guttmann; Benjamin S Glicksberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248583,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248583,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
175,Factors Associated with Longitudinal Psychological and Physiological Stress in Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in psychological distress in health care workers (HCWs). There is a need to characterize which HCWs are at increased risk of psychological sequela from the pandemic.

MethodsHCWs across seven hospitals in New York City were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational digital study using the custom Warrior Watch Study App. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study measuring HRV throughout the follow up period. Surveys were obtained daily.

ResultsThree hundred and sixty-one HCWs were enrolled. Multivariable analysis found New York City COVID-19 case count to be significantly associated with increased longitudinal stress (p=0.008). A non-significant decrease in stress (p=0.23) was observed following COVID-19 diagnosis, though there was a borderline significant increase following the 4-week period after a COVID-19 diagnosis via nasal PCR (p=0.05). Baseline emotional support, baseline quality of life and baseline resilience were associated with decreased longitudinal stress (p<0.001). Baseline resilience and emotional support were found to buffer against stressors, with a significant reduction in stress during the 4-week period after COVID-19 diagnosis observed only in participants in the highest tertial of emotional support and resilience (effect estimate -0.97, p=0.03; estimate -1.78, p=0.006). A significant trend between New York City COVID-19 case count and longitudinal stress was observed only in the high tertial emotional support group (estimate 1.22, p=0.005), and was borderline significant in the high and medium resilience tertials (estimate 1.29, p=0.098; estimate 1.14, p=0.09). Participants in the highest tertial of baseline emotional support and resilience had significantly reduced amplitude and acrophase of the circadian pattern of longitudinally collected heart rate variability.

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that low resilience, emotional support, and quality of life identify HCWs at risk of high perceived longitudinal stress secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic and have a distinct physiological stress profile. Assessment of HCWs for these features can identify and permit allocation of psychological support to these at-risk individuals as the COVID-19 pandemic and its psychological effects continue in this vulnerable population.",Robert P Hirten; Matteo Danieletto; Lewis Tomalin; Katie Hyewon Choi; Micol Zweig; Eddye Golden; Sparshdeep Kaur; Drew Helmus; Anthony Biello; Renata Pyzik; Claudia Calcogna; Robert Freeman; Bruce E Sands; Dennis Charney; Erwin P Bottinger; Laurie Keefer; Mayte Suarez Farinas; Girish Nadkarni; Zahi A Fayad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248593,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248593,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
176,Time use and social mixing during and around festive periods: Potential changes in the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from increased intergenerational interactions,"RationaleAmid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in which many countries have adopted physical distancing measures, tiered restrictions, and episodic ""lockdowns,"" the impact of potentially increased social mixing during festive holidays on the age distribution of new COVID-19 cases remains unclear.

ObjectiveWe aimed to gain insights into possible changes in the age distribution of COVID-19 cases in the UK after temporarily increased intergenerational interactions in late December 2020.

MethodWe modelled changes in time use and social mixing based on age-stratified contact rates using historical nationally-representative surveys and up-to-date Google mobility data from four weeks before and after the festive period. We explored changes in the effective reproduction number and the age distribution of cases, in four scenarios: (1) ""normal"": time use and contact patterns as observed historically, (2) ""pre-lockdown"": patterns as seen before the lockdown in November 2020, (3) ""lockdown"": patterns restricted as in November 2020, and (4) ""festive break"": similar to 3 but with social visits over the holiday period as in 1.

ResultsAcross ages, the estimated Reff decreases during the festive break in scenarios 1-3 and returns to pre-holiday levels in scenarios 2-3, while remaining relatively stable in scenario 4. Relative incidence is likely to decrease in children aged 0-15 but increase in other ages. Changes in age distribution were large during the holidays, and are likely to start before the holidays for individuals aged 16-24 years in scenarios 1-3.

ConclusionsOur modelling findings suggest that increased contacts during the festive period may shift the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from children towards adults. Given that COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths rise by age, more intergenerational mixing risks an increased burden in the period following the holidays.

HighlightsO_LIHome visits are associated with increased intergenerational mixing.
C_LIO_LIThe effective reproduction number is likely to remain stable or even reduce slightly due to a reduction in contacts at work and school.
C_LIO_LIRelative incidence is likely to become lower in children, but higher in the

177,Experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analysis of risk perceptions and mental health in a student cohort,"ObjectiveThis study examined the COVID-19 risk perceptions and mental health of university students on returning to campus in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsAn online survey was completed during the first four weeks of the academic year (October 2020) by 897 university students. The survey included demographics and measures of experiences of COVID-19 testing, self-isolation, shielding, perceived risk, mental health and indices capturing related psychological responses to the pandemic.

ResultsWe observed higher levels of depression and anxiety, but not stress, in students compared with pre- pandemic normative data, but lower than levels reported earlier in the pandemic in other similar cohorts. Depression, anxiety and stress were independently associated with greater loneliness and reduced positive mood. Greater worry about COVID-19 was also independently associated with anxiety and stress. Female students and those with pre-existing mental health disorders were at greatest risk of poor mental health outcomes.

ConclusionAlthough students perceived themselves at only moderate risk of COVID-19, the prevalence of depression and anxiety among university students should remain a concern. Universities should provide adequate support for students mental health during term-time.

179,Telehealth Applied to Deliver In Situ Behavioral Skills Training to Reduce Car Seat Misuse During the CovidAcc19 Pandemic,"ObjectiveThe use of telehealth has been a common approach to deliver health education before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its ability to apply behavioral skills training (BST) for CRS education has been undocumented. This study assessed the efficacy of telehealth to deliver in-situ behavioral skills training (BST) to teach expectant parents how to install and use their child restraint system (CRS) to reduce misuse and improve retention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodA repeated measures group design was used to evaluate 171 individual participants, in a 37-step CRS task analysis for baseline, BST, and follow-up. Performance across all participants was aggregated for each task analysis. Participants were recruited from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration car seat fitting stations during the Covid-19 pandemic between March through July, 2020.

ResultsBaseline results identified significant critical misuse across participants. With BST, delivered with telehealth, misuse decreased by 97% among 37 task objectives. A 2-week follow-up evaluation concluded that 100% of participants retained the skills they mastered during BST.

ConclusionsThis study suggests the use of telehealth, as a method of BST delivery for CRS education, is an effective approach to reduce CRS misuse and the burden of child occupant motor vehicle injury. It was found to empower participants and improve their self-confidence, while ensuring the safety of their child occupant.

This study aims to investigate visit to which category of places among grocery, retail, parks, workplaces, residential, and transit stations is more associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in India. A longitudinal analysis of generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a Poisson log-linear model is employed to analyze the daily mobility rate and reported new cases of COVID-19 between March 14 and September 11, 2020. This study finds that mobility to places of grocery (food and vegetable markets, drug stores etc.) and retail (restaurants, cafes, shopping centres etc.) is significantly associated (at p<0.01) with the incidence of COVID-19. In contrast, visits to parks, transit stations and mobility within residential neighbourhoods are not statistically significant (p>0.05) in changing COVID-19 cases over time.

181,"Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.",Michelle N Meyer; Tamara Gjorgjieva; Daniel Rosica,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248555,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248555,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

Four weeks later, a systematic study of testing for past or present infections among healthcare workers in the region was launched. Only a minority of COVID-19 related deaths occurred at hospitals and the study was therefore extended to employees in companies providing home care services for the elderly.

MethodsFive companies offered participation to 438 employees at work and 405 employees (92.5%) were enrolled. Serum samples were analyzed for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and throat swabs were tested by for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR.

ResultsAmong home care employees, 20.1% (81/403) were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n=3,671; 9.7% seropositivity). Only 13/379 employees (3.4%) had evidence of a current infection (PCR positivity). Among these, 5 were also seropositive (a sign of past infection or lingering infection after symptoms have resolved) and 3 were positive with only low amounts of virus. The combination of high amounts of virus and no antibodies, a characteristic for pre-symptomatic COVID-19, was thus present only in 5 employees (1.3%).

ConclusionsPersonnel providing home service for the elderly appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

183,LungAI: A Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Detection of COVID-19 from Posteroanterior Chest X-Rays,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of December 2020, more than 72 million cases have been reported worldwide. The standard method of diagnosis is by Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) from a Nasopharyngeal Swab. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Due to rate of spreading of the disease manual detection among people is becoming more difficult because of a clear lack of testing capability. Thus there was need of a quick and reliable yet non-labour intensive detection technique. Considering that the virus predominantly appears in the form of a lung based abnormality I made use of Chest X-Rays as our primary mode of detection. For this detection system we made use of Posteroanterior (PA) Chest X-rays of people infected with Bacterial Pneumonia (2780 Images), Viral Pneumonia (1493 Images), Covid-19 (729 Images) as well as those of perfectly Healthy Individuals (1583 Images) procured from various Publicly Available Datasets and Radiological Societies. LungAI is a novel Convolutional Neural Network based on a Hybrid of the DarkNet and AlexNet architecture. The network was trained on 80% of the dataset with 20% kept for validation. The proposed Coronavirus Detection Model performed exceedingly well with an accuracy of 99.16%, along with a Sensitivity value of 99.31% and Specificity value of 99.14%.

Methods64 older women (age = 72{+/-}5 ys) who participated in a physical exercise/educational program and adhered to government home confinement recommendations have their levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior and HRQL assessed before and during (11 to 13 weeks after introduction of government recommendations to reduce virus transmission) COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsThere were significant reductions in total physical activity (-259 METs/week, P = 0.02), as a result of a [~]17.0 % reduction in walking (-30.8 min/week, P = 0.004) and [~]41.8 % reduction in vigorous-intensity activity (-29.6 min/week, P < 0.001).

However, no significant change occurred in moderate-intensity physical activity, and HRQL domains and facets, except for an improvement in environment domain.

ConclusionHome confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic decreased levels of physical activity and increased levels of sedentary behavior in previously active older women who participated in an educational program. However, there were no significant changes in HRQL. These results suggest that educational programs promoting healthy behaviors may attenuate the impact of home confinement in older women.",Vanessa Teixeira do Amaral; Isabela Roque Marcal; Thiago da Cruz Silva; Fernanda Bianchi Souza; Yacco Volpato Munhoz; Pedro Henrique Camprigher Witzler; Matheus Monge Soares Correa; Bianca Fernandes; Emmanuel Gomes Ciolac,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248662,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248662,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
185,When months matter; modelling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnostic pathway of Motor Neurone Disease (MND),"BackgroundA diagnosis of MND takes an average 10-16 months from symptom onset. Early diagnosis is important to access supportive measures to maximise quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in NHS pathways; the majority of GP appointments now occur online with subsequent delays in secondary care assessment. Given the rapid progression of MND, patients may be disproportionately affected resulting in late stage new presentations. We used Monte Carlo simulation to model the pre-COVID-19 diagnostic pathway and then introduced plausible COVID-19 delays.

MethodsThe diagnostic pathway was modelled using gamma distributions of time taken: 1) from symptom onset to GP presentation, 2) for specialist referral, and 3) for diagnosis reached after neurology appointment. We incorporated branches to simulate delays: when patients did not attend their GP and when the GP consultation did not result in referral. An emergency presentation was triggered when diagnostic pathway time was within 30 days of projected median survival. Total time-to-diagnosis was calculated over 100,000 iterations. The pre-COVID-19 model was estimated using published data and the Improving MND Care Survey 2019. We estimated COVID-19 delays using published statistics.

ResultsThe pre-COVID model reproduced known features of the MND diagnostic pathway, with a median time to diagnosis of 399 days and predicting 5.2% of MND patients present as undiagnosed emergencies. COVID-19 resulted in diagnostic delays from 558 days when only primary care was 25% delayed, to 915 days when both primary and secondary care were 75%. The model predicted an increase in emergency presentations ranging from 15.4%-44.5%.

InterpretationsThe model suggests the COVID-19 pandemic will result in later-stage diagnoses and more emergency presentations of undiagnosed MND. Late-stage presentations may require rapid escalation to multidisciplinary care. Proactive recognition of acute and late-stage disease with altered service provision will optimise care for people with MND.

186,Minimizing cumulative risk to control airborne transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in schools,"School classrooms, where students and teachers spend prolonged periods of time, are risky environments for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV2. While countries worldwide have been pursuing different school reopening strategies, most EU countries are planning to keep schools open during the whole winter season 2020/21. However, this poses a controversial ""technical"" issue: air ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to lower down sensibly due to colder outdoor temperatures. More specifically, personnel and students will ask for more window closure during winter lessons and regulators will probably allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. A fundamental question arise: to which extent can we contain airborne risk in schools during the cold season? What would be the best mitigation strategy considering also the risk for other seasonal diseases? To try answering these questions the concept of cumulative risk is presented, showing the link between intervals of ventilation (natural or mechanical) and the lowering of aerosol contagion risk. A safety risk-zone and a theoretical optimum are presented based on air change intervals optimization.",Alessandro Zivelonghi; Massimo Lai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248493,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248493,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
187,Spatial Allocation of Scarce Vaccine and Antivirals for COVID-19,"Although the COVID-19 disease burden is heterogeneous across space, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends an equitable spatial allocation of pharmaceutical interventions based, for example, on population size, in the interest of speed and workability. Utilizing economic-epidemiological modeling, we benchmark the performance of ad hoc allocation rules of scarce vaccines and drugs by comparing them to the rules for a vaccine and for a drug treatment that minimize the economic damages and expenditures over time, including a penalty cost representing the social costs of deviating from an ad hoc allocation. Under different levels of vaccine and drug scarcity, we consider scenarios where length of immunity and compliance to travel restrictions vary, and consider the robustness of the rules when assumptions regarding these factors are incorrect. Because drugs and vaccines attack different points in the disease pathology, the benefits from deviating from the ad hoc rule differ. For drug treatment, optimal policies often allocate all available treatments to one jurisdiction for a period of time, while ad hoc rules act to spread out treatments across jurisdictions. For vaccines, the benefits from deviating are especially high when immunity is permanent, when there is compliance to travel restrictions, and when the supply of vaccine is low. Interestingly, a lack of compliance to travel restrictions pushes the optimal allocations of vaccine towards the ad hoc and improves the relative robustness of the ad hoc rules, as the mixing of the populations reduces the spatial heterogeneity in disease burden.",François M.

188,COVID-19 Risk Stratification and Mortality Prediction in Hospitalized Indian Patients,"The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is highly variable with the vast majority recovering uneventfully but a small fraction progressing to severe disease and death. Appropriate and timely supportive care can reduce mortality and it is critical to evolve better patient risk stratification based on simple clinical data, so as to perform effective triage during strains on the healthcare infrastructure. This study presents risk stratification and mortality prediction models based on usual clinical data from 544 COVID-19 patients from New Delhi, India using machine learning methods. An XGboost classifier yielded the best performance on risk stratification (F1 score of 0.81). A logistic regression model yielded the best performance on mortality prediction (F1 score of 0.71). Significant biomarkers for predicting risk and mortality were identified. Examination of the data in comparison to a similar dataset with a Wuhan cohort of 375 patients was undertaken to understand the much lower mortality rates in India and the possible reasons thereof. The comparison indicated higher survival rate in the Delhi cohort even when patients had similar parameters as the Wuhan patients who died. Steroid administration was very frequent in Delhi patients, especially in surviving patients whose biomarkers indicated severe disease. This study helps in identifying the high-risk patient population and suggests treatment protocols that may be useful in countries with high mortality rates.",Shanmukh Alle; Samreen Siddiqui; Akshay Kanakan; Akshit Garg; Akshaya Karthikeyan; Neha Mishra; Swati Waghdhare; Akansha Tyagi; Bansidhar Tarai; Pranjal Pratim Hazarika; Poonam Das; Sandeep Budhiraja; Vivek Nangia; Arun Dewan; Ramanathan Sethuraman; C.

189,How do Covid-19 policy options depend on end-of-year holiday contacts in Mexico City Metropolitan Area? A Modeling Study,"BackgroundWith more than 20 million residents, Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has the largest number of Covid-19 cases in Mexico and is at risk of exceeding its hospital capacity in late December 2020.

MethodsWe used SC-COSMO, a dynamic compartmental Covid-19 model, to evaluate scenarios considering combinations of increased contacts during the holiday season, intensification of social distancing, and school reopening. Model parameters were derived from primary data from MCMA, published literature, and calibrated to time-series of incident confirmed cases, deaths, and hospital occupancy. Outcomes included projected confirmed cases and deaths, hospital demand, and magnitude of hospital capacity exceedance.

FindingsFollowing high levels of holiday contacts even with no in-person schooling, we predict that MCMA will have 1{middle dot}0 million (95% prediction interval 0{middle dot}5 - 1{middle dot}7) additional Covid-19 cases between December 7, 2020 and March 7, 2021 and that hospitalizations will peak at 35,000 (14,700 - 67,500) on January 27, 2021, with a >99% chance of exceeding Covid-19-specific capacity (9,667 beds). If holiday contacts can be controlled, MCMA can reopen in-person schools provided social distancing is increased with 0{middle dot}5 million (0{middle dot}2 - 1{middle dot}0) additional cases and hospitalizations peaking at 14,900 (5,600 - 32,000) on January 23, 2021 (77% chance of exceedance).

InterpretationMCMA must substantially increase Covid-19 hospital capacity under all scenarios considered. MCMAs ability to reopen schools in mid-January 2021 depends on sustaining social distancing and that contacts during the end-of-year holiday were well controlled.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs of mid-December 2020, Mexico has the twelfth highest incidence of confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide and its epidemic is currently growing. Mexicos case fatality ratio (CFR) - 9{middle dot}1% - is the second highest in the world. With more than 20 million residents, Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has the highest number and incidence rate of Covid-19 confirmed cases in Mexico and a CFR of 8{middle dot}1%. MCMA is nearing its current hospital capacity even as it faces the prospect of increased social contacts during the 2020 end-of-year holidays. There is limited Mexico-specific evidence available on epidemic, such as parameters governing time-dependent mortality, hospitalization and transmission. Literature searches required supplementation through primary data analysis and model calibration to support the first realistic model-based Covid-19 policy evaluation for Mexico, which makes this analysis relevant and timely.

Added value of this studyStudy strengths include the use of detailed primary data provided by MCMA; the Bayesian model calibration to enable evaluation of projections and their uncertainty; and consideration of both epidemic and health system outcomes. The model projects that failure to limit social contacts during the end-of-year holidays will substantially accelerate MCMAs epidemic (1{middle dot}0 million (95% prediction interval 0{middle dot}5 - 1{middle dot}7) additional cases by early March 2021). Hospitalization demand could reach 35,000 (14,700 - 67,500), with a >99% chance of exceeding current capacity (9,667 beds). Controlling social contacts during the holidays could enable MCMA to reopen in-person schooling without greatly exacerbating the epidemic provided social distancing in both schools and the community were maintained. Under all scenarios and policies, current hospital capacity appears insufficient, highlighting the need for rapid capacity expansion.

Implications of all the available evidenceMCMA officials should prioritize rapid hospital capacity expansion.

190,Development and Evaluation of Two Rapid Indigenous IgG-ELISA immobilized with ACE-2 Binding Peptides for Detection Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 pandemic situation demands effective serological tests with a view to adopting and developing policy for disease management, determining protective immunity as well as for sero-epidemiological study. Our study aims to develop and evaluate two rapid in-house ELISA assays targeting neutralizing antibodies (IgG) against S1 subunit of spike in SARS-CoV-2 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), as well as comparative analysis with nucleocapsid (NCP) ELISA. The assays were conducted with 184 samples in three panels collected from 134 patients. Panel 1 and 2 consist of RT-PCR positive samples collected within two weeks and after two weeks of symptom onset, respectively. Negative samples are included in panel 3 from healthy donors and pre-pandemic dengue patients. The total assay time has been set 30 minutes for both of the ELISA assays. Results show that S1 and RBD ELISA demonstrates 73.68% and 84.21% sensitivities, respectively for samples collected within two weeks, whereas 100% sensitivities were achieved by both for samples that were collected after two weeks of the onset of symptoms. S1-ELISA shows 0% positivity to panel 3 while for RBD-ELISA the figure is 1%. A strong correlation (rs=0.804, p<0.0001)) has been observed between these two assays. When compared with NCP-ELISA, S1 slightly better correlation (rs=0.800, p<0.0001) than RBD (rs=0.740, p<0.0001). Our study suggests S1-ELISA as more sensitive one than the RBD or nucleocapsid ELISA during the later phase of infection, while for overall sero-monitoring RBD specific IgG ELISA is recommended. Moreover, non-reactivity to dengue emphasize the use of these assays for serosurveillance of COVID-19 in the dengue endemic regions.

HighlightsO_LIThe total assay time of these assays are 30 minutes.

191,Immunogenicity and crossreactivity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein,"COVID-19 patients elicit strong responses to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 but binding antibodies are also detected in prepandemic individuals, indicating potential crossreactivity with common cold human coronaviruses (HCoV) and questioning its utility in seroprevalence studies. We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV. We indentified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with HCoV that was more specific and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N also recognised N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognised SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha-rather than beta-HCoV despite having less sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in rRT-PCR negative individuals, reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer symptoms and in females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster. In conclusion, N is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2-specific and HCoV crossreactive antibodies, both of which may affect the acquisition of immunity to COVID-19.",Carlota Dobano; Rebeca Santano; Alfons Jimenez; Marta Vidal; Jordi Chi; Natalia Rodrigo Melero; Matija Popovic; Ruben Lopez-Aladid; Laia Fernandez-Barat; Marta Tortajada; Francisco Carmona-Torre; Gabriel Reina; Antoni Torres; Alfredo Mayor; Carlo Carolis; Alberto L Garcia-Basteiro; Ruth Aguilar; Gemma Moncunill; Luis Izquierdo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248551,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
192,Predicting intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among the general population using the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior Model,"BackgroundA novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March, 2020. Until such time as a vaccine becomes available, it is important to identify the determining factors that influence the intention of the general public to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine. Consequently, we aim to explore behavioral-related factors predicting intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among the general population using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model.

MethodsAn online survey was conducted among adults aged 18 years and older from May 24 to June 24, 2020. The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to the HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.

ResultsEighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB covariates as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.78). Men (OR=4.35, 95% CI 1.58-11.93), educated respondents (OR=3.54, 95% CI 1.44-8.67) and respondents who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the previous year (OR=3.31, 95% CI 1.22-9.00) stated higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR=4.49, 95% CI 2.79-7.22), of perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (OR=2.36, 95% CI 1.58-3.51) and of cues to action (OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.38-2.87), according to HBM, and if they reported higher levels of subjective norms (OR=3.04, 95% CI 2.15-4.30) and self-efficacy (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.54-2.72) according to TPB. Although half of the respondents reported they had not received influenza vaccine last year, 40% of them intended to receive influenza vaccine in the coming winter and 66% of them intended to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsProviding data on the public perspective and predicting intention for COVID-19 vaccination using HBM and TPB is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers and can help better guide compliance as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to the public.",Liora Shmueli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248587,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248587,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
193,Changes in UK hospital mortality in the first wave of COVID-19: the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol prospective multicentre observational cohort study,"BackgroundMortality rates of UK patients hospitalised with COVID-19 appeared to fall during the first wave. We quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital.

MethodsThe International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort admitted to 247 acute UK hospitals with COVID-19 in the first wave (March to August 2020). Outcome was hospital mortality within 28 days of admission. We performed a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and hospital mortality adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidity, illness severity) and quantifying potential mediators (respiratory support and steroids).

FindingsUnadjusted hospital mortality fell from 32.3% (95%CI 31.8, 32.7) in March/April to 16.4% (95%CI 15.0, 17.8) in June/July 2020. Reductions were seen in all ages, ethnicities, both sexes, and in comorbid and non-comorbid patients. After adjustment, there was a 19% reduction in the odds of mortality per 4 week period (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.79, 0.83). 15.2% of this reduction was explained by greater disease severity and comorbidity earlier in the epidemic. The use of respiratory support changed with greater use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 22.2% (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.94, 0.96) of the reduction in mortality was mediated by changes in respiratory support.

InterpretationThe fall in hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in case mix and illness severity. A significant reduction was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which may partly reflect improved clinical decision making. The remaining improvement in mortality is not explained by these factors, and may relate to community behaviour on inoculum dose and hospital capacity strain.

Key points / Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSRisk factors for mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 have been established. However there is little literature regarding how mortality is changing over time, and potential explanations for why this might be. Understanding changes in mortality rates over time will help policy makers identify evolving risk, strategies to manage this and broader decisions about public health interventions.

Added value of this studyMortality in hospitalised patients at the beginning of the first wave was extremely high. Patients who were admitted to hospital in March and early April were significantly more unwell at presentation than patients who were admitted in later months. Mortality fell in all ages, ethnic groups, both sexes and in patients with and without comorbidity, over and above contributions from falling illness severity. After adjustment for these variables, a fifth of the fall in mortality was explained by changes in the use of respiratory support and steroid treatment, along with associated changes in clinical decision-making relating to supportive interventions. However, mortality was persistently high in patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, and in those patients who received non-invasive ventilation outside of critical care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe observed reduction in hospital mortality was greater than expected based on the changes seen in both case mix and illness severity. Some of this fall can be explained by changes in respiratory care, including clinical learning. In addition, introduction of community policies including wearing of masks, social distancing, shielding of vulnerable patients and the UK lockdown potentially resulted in people being exposed to less virus.

The decrease in mortality varied depending on the level of respiratory support received. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation have persistently high mortality rates, albeit with a changing case-mix, and further research should target this group.

Severe COVID-19 disease has primarily affected older people in the UK. Many of these people, but not all have significant frailty.

194,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein vaccine against COVID-19 in adults: pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials","BackgroundA safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.

MethodsWe did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085.

FindingsBetween June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 g or 50 g dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 g group) and 93% (the 50 g group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 g group and 117.8 for the 50 g group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 g group and 69.1 for the 50 g group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses. The 50 g group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 g group.

InterpretationThe protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 g vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

MethodsA national surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions (DATCOV) was established. Using DATCOV data, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and in-hospital mortality among individuals admitted to public and private hospitals with COVID-19 during 5 March to 11 August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the role of HIV-status, underlying comorbidities and their interaction on in-hospital COVID-19-associated mortality.

FindingsAmong the 41,877 individuals admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, hospital admissions peaked at 1,560 admissions per day, in late July and 7,662 (18.3%) died. Comorbidities were documented in 27,555 (65.8%) individuals, most commonly observed were hypertension (36.8%), diabetes (29.6%), obesity (19.7%), and HIV (8.7%); TB was reported in 0.7% of individuals. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with HIV and TB, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as increasing age, male sex, non-White race (Black, mixed and Indian race), chronic underlying conditions particularly hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In particular, HIV-infected individuals with immunosuppression had increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1). Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes was 39.9%. The effect of one or more comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals.

InterpretationThese data provide a better understanding of the interaction of non-communicable diseases, chronic infectious diseases like HIV and TB and COVID-19. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying comorbidities (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals. HIV- and TB-infected individuals, particularly those with additional comorbidities, would benefit from COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes.

FundingDATCOV is funded by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the South African National Government. No additional funding was obtained towards the completion of this analysis and the development of this manuscript.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in context

Evidence before this studySince the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies from Brazil, China, India, Iran, United States and several countries in Europe have identified older age, male sex and presence of underlying comorbidities including hypertension, heart disease and diabetes as risk factors for severe disease and death. There are very few studies, however, carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Africa, many of whom have high poverty rates, limited access to healthcare, and high prevalence of chronic communicable diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB). Data are also limited from settings with limited access to HIV treatment programmes. Early small cohort studies mainly from high income countries were not conclusive on whether HIV or TB are risk factors for disease severity and death in COVID-19 patients. Recent large studies from South Africas Western Cape province and the United Kingdom (UK) have found HIV-infected individuals to have a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 associated mortality. However, the UK reported risk among all confirmed cases while data from the Western Cape suggested an increase in both all confirmed cases and those admitted to hospital. Of these, only the Western Cape study presented data on mortality risk associated with presence of high viral load or immunosuppression, and found similar levels of severity irrespective of these factors. No studies reported on the interaction between HIV-infection and other non-communicable comorbidities on COVID-19 associated mortality.

We performed separate literature searches on PubMed using the following terms: ""COVID-19"" ""death risk factors"" and ""mortality""; ""HIV"" ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality""; ""TB"", ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality"". All searches included publications from December 2019 until July 12, 2020 without language restrictions. Pooled together, we identified 232 published papers. Additionally, we performed two literature searches on MedRxiv using the terms ""HIV"", ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality"", and ""TB"", ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality"" from April 25 until July 12, 2020 without language restrictions. Pooled together, we identified six pre-prints.

Added value of this studyAmong a large national cohort of over 40,000 individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in a high HIV and TB prevalence setting, we found that HIV and TB were associated with a moderately increased risk of in-hospital mortality. We found increasing risk of mortality among HIV-infected individuals with moderate/severe immunosuppression compared to those without immunosuppression. Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities was high (40%) and the effect of increasing numbers of comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals. Our study included HIV-infected individuals from all provinces in the country with varying levels of access to HIV treatment programmes. Other risk factors described elsewhere in the world such as increasing age, obesity and chronic underlying illness (particularly hypertension and diabetes) were also associated with increased mortality in this cohort.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe evidence suggests that HIV- and TB-infected individuals should be prioritised for COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes, particularly those with additional comorbidities. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying illness (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals.

196,Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations in acutely ill patients,"Dysregulated immune profiles have been described in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Whether the reported immune alterations are specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection or also triggered by other acute illnesses remains unclear. We performed flow cytometry analysis on fresh peripheral blood from a consecutive cohort of i) patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; ii) patients of comparable age/sex hospitalized for other acute disease (SARS-CoV-2 negative); and iii) healthy controls. Using both data-driven and hypothesis-driven analyses, we found several dysregulations in immune cell subsets (e.g. decreased proportion of T cells) that are similarly associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-COVID-19 related acute illnesses. In contrast, we identified specific differences in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 status (e.g. elevated proportion of ICAM-1+ mature/activated neutrophils, ALCAM+ monocytes, and CD38+CD8+ T cells). A subset of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations correlated with disease severity, disease outcome at 30 days and mortality. Our data provides novel understanding of the immune dysregulation that are specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among acute care hospitalized patients. Our study lays the foundation for the development of specific biomarkers to stratify SARS-CoV-2+ patients at risk of unfavorable outcome and uncover novel candidate molecules to investigate from a therapeutic perspective.",Rose-Marie Rebillard; Marc Charabati; Camille Grasmuck; Abdelali Filali-Mouhim; Olivier Tastet; Nathalie Brassard; Audrey Daigneault; Lyne Bourbonniere; Renaud Balthazard; Ana Carmena Moratalla; Yves Carpentier Solorio; Negar Farzam-kia; Antoine Philippe Fournier; Elizabeth Gowing; Helene Jamann; Florent Lemaitre; Victoria Hannah Mamane; Karine Thai; Jean-Franois Cailhier; Nicolas Chomont; Andres Finzi; Michael Chasse; Madeleine Durand; Nathalie Arbour; Daniel E Kaufmann; Alexandre Prat; Catherine Larochelle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248642,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248642,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
197,"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; longevity, breadth, and evasion by emerging viral variants","The SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization response and its evasion by emerging viral variants are unknown. Antibody immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and Spike variants, inhibition of Spike-driven virus-cell fusion, and infectious SARS-CoV-2 neutralization were characterized in 807 serial samples from 233 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 individuals with detailed demographics and followed up to seven months. A broad and sustained polyantigenic immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins, along with high viral neutralization were associated with COVID-19 severity. A subgroup of  high responders maintained high neutralizing responses over time, representing ideal convalescent plasma therapy donors. Antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 during the first COVID-19 wave had reduced immunoreactivity and neutralization potency to emerging Spike variants. Accurate monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses would be essential for selection of optimal plasma donors and vaccine monitoring and design.

198,Clinical outcomes and risk factors for COVID-19 among migrant populations in high-income countries: a systematic review,"BackgroundMigrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, labour migrants, and undocumented migrants, now constitute a considerable proportion of most high-income countries populations, including their skilled and unskilled workforces. Migrants may be at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their health and social circumstances, yet the extent to which they are being affected and their predisposing risk factors are not clearly understood. We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations (cases, hospitalisations, deaths), indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors.

MethodsWe did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222135). We searched databases including PubMed, Global Health, Scopus, CINAHL, and pre-print databases (medRxiv) via the WHO Global Research on COVID-19 database to Nov 18, 2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature pertaining to migrants (defined as foreign born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on our primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts, and risk factors, using narrative synthesis.

Results3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps and labour compounds may have been especially affected. In general, migrants have higher levels of many risk factors and vulnerabilities relevant to COVID-19, including increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to high-risk occupations and overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to health care including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement to healthcare coverage related to their immigration status.

ConclusionsMigrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health responses to the pandemic and should inform policymaking on strategies for reducing transmission of COVID-19 in this population. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.",Sally E Hayward; Anna Deal; Cherie Cheng; Alison F Crawshaw; Miriam Orcutt; Tushna F Vandrevala; Marrie Norredam; Manuel Carballo; Yusuf Ciftci; Ana Requena-Mendez; Chris Greenaway; Jessica Carter; Felicity Knights; Anushka Mehrotra; Farah Seedat; Kayvan Bozorgmehr; Apostolos Veizis; Ines Campos-Matos; Fatima Wurie; Teymur Noori; Martin McKee; Bernadette Kumar; Sally Hargreaves,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248475,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248475,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
199,The first wave of the Spanish COVID-19 epidemic was associated with early introductions and fast spread of a dominating genetic variant,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world since the beginning of 2020. Spain is among the European countries with the highest incidence of the disease during the first pandemic wave. We established a multidisciplinar consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, with the aim of contributing to decision making and stopping rapid spreading across the country. We present the results for 2170 sequences from the first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in Spain and representing 12% of diagnosed cases until 14th March. This effort allows us to document at least 500 initial introductions, between early February-March from multiple international sources. Importantly, we document the early raise of two dominant genetic variants in Spain (Spanish Epidemic Clades), named SEC7 and SEC8, likely amplified by superspreading events. In sharp contrast to other non-Asian countries those two variants were closely related to the initial variants of SARS-CoV-2 described in Asia and represented 40% of the genome sequences analyzed. The two dominant SECs were widely spread across the country compared to other genetic variants with SEC8 reaching a 60% prevalence just before the lockdown. Employing Bayesian phylodynamic analysis, we inferred a reduction in the effective reproductive number of these two SECs from around 2.5 to below 0.5 after the implementation of strict public-health interventions in mid March. The effects of lockdown on the genetic variants of the virus are reflected in the general replacement of preexisting SECs by a new variant at the beginning of the summer season. Our results reveal a significant difference in the genetic makeup of the epidemic in Spain and support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread even for the most successful genetic variants. Finally, earlier control of SEC7 and particularly SEC8 might have reduced the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in our country.",Mariana G.

200,From SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19 disease: a proposed mechanism for viral spread to the lower airway based on in silico estimation of virion flow rates,"While the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory airway is the dominant initial infection site for SARS-CoV-2, the physiologic mechanism that launches the infection in the lower airway is still not well-understood. Based on the rapidity with which SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to the lungs, it has been conjectured that the nasopharynx acts as the seeding zone for subsequent contamination of the lower airway via aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. In this study, we examine the plausibility of this proposed mechanism. To this end, we have developed computational fluid mechanics models of the inhalation process in two medical imaging based airway reconstructions and have quantified the nasopharyngeal liquid volume ingested into the lower airspace during each aspiration. The numerical predictions are validated by comparing the number of projected aspirations (approximately 2 - 4) during an eight-hour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3 aspirations in human subjects. Extending the numerical trends on aspiration volume to earlier records on aspiration frequency for the entire day indicates a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 0.3 - 0.76 ml per day. We then used sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients to estimate the number of virions that are transmitted daily to the lungs via nasopharyngeal liquid boluses. For mean sputum viral load, our modeling projects that the number of virions penetrating to the lower airway per day will range over 2.1 x 106 - 5.3 x 106; for peak viral load, the corresponding number of penetrating virions hovers between 7.1 x 108 - 17.9 x 108. These findings fill in a key piece of the mechanistic puzzle of the progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasopharynx to the development of COVID-19 disease within a patient, and point to dysphagia as a potential underlying risk factor for COVID-19. The findings also have significant practical implications in the design of COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics that aim to constrain the pathogenic progress of the disease within the limits of the upper airway.",Saikat Basu; Arijit Chakravarty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248544,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248544,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
201,A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis for COVID-19 Treatments,"BackgroundNumerous interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been investigated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19.

MethodsWe searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications.

ResultsWe identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta (OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI [1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28, 2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty). About two-thirds of the studies included in this NMA were rated as high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was either low or very low for most of the comparisons.

ConclusionThe Bayesian NMA identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments over SOC in terms of mortality, requirement of MV, hospital discharge and viral clearance.

202,Comparative analysis of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assays for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide and there is an urgent need to increase our diagnostic capacity to identify infected cases. Although RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, this method requires specialised equipment in a diagnostic laboratory and has a long turn-around time to process the samples. To address this, several groups have recently reported development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a simple, low cost and rapid method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Herein we present a comparative analysis of three LAMP-based assays that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab RdRP, ORF1ab nsp3 and Gene N. We perform a detailed assessment of their sensitivity, kinetics and false positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in LAMP or RT-LAMP reactions, using colorimetric or fluorescent detection. Our results independently validate that all three assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 in 30 minutes, with robust accuracy at detecting as little as 1000 RNA copies and the results can be visualised simply by color changes. We also note the shortcomings of these LAMP-based assays, including variable results with shorter reaction time or lower load of SARS-CoV-2, and false positive results in some experimental conditions. Overall for RT-LAMP detection, the ORF1ab RdRP and ORF1ab nsp3 assays have higher sensitivity and faster kinetics for detection, whereas the Gene N assay exhibits no false positives in 30 minutes reaction time. This study provides validation of the performance of LAMP-based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which have important implications in development of point-of-care diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2.",Daniel Urrutia-Cabrera; Roxanne Hsiang-Chi Liou; Jianxiong Chan; Sandy Shen-Chi Hung; Alex W Hewitt; Keith Martin; Patrick Kwan; Raymond Ching-Bong Wong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248288,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248288,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

204,SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia predicts clinical deterioration and extrapulmonary complications from COVID-19.,"BackgroundThe determinants of COVID-19 disease severity and extrapulmonary complications (EPCs) are poorly understood. We characterise the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs.

MethodsWe used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterised the role of RNAaemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression.

Findings23{middle dot}0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1{middle dot}4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAaemia 10 days after onset of symptoms, but took 16 days to reach maximum severity, and 33 days for symptoms to resolve. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6{middle dot}72 [95% CI, 2{middle dot}45 - 19{middle dot}79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2{middle dot}43 [95% CI, 1{middle dot}07 - 5{middle dot}38]), and EPCs (OR 2{middle dot}81 [95% CI, 1{middle dot}26 - 6{middle dot}36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0{middle dot}47 [95% CI, 0{middle dot}20 - 0{middle dot}67]).

InterpretationdPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAaemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe varied clinical manifestations of COVID-19 have directed attention to the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the body. Although most concentrated and tested for in the nasopharynx, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in blood, stool, and numerous tissues, raising questions about dissemination of viral RNA throughout the body, and the role of this process in disease severity and extrapulmonary complications. Recent studies have detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood using either quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (qPCR) or droplet digital PCR (dPCR), and have associated RNAaemia with disease severity and biomarkers of dysregulated immune response.

Added value of this studyWe quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx and plasma of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with COVID-19, and found an array-based dPCR platform to be markedly more sensitive than qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a simplified workflow well-suited to clinical adoption. We collected serial plasma samples during patients course of illness, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia peaks early, while clinical condition often continues to worsen. Our findings confirm the association between RNAaemia and disease severity, and additionally demonstrate a role for RNAaemia in predicting future deterioration and specific extrapulmonary complications.

206,Clustering and longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in school-children: prospective cohort study of 55 schools in Switzerland,"Background and aimsThe facilitating role of schools in SARS-CoV-2 infection spread is still debated and the potential of school closures to mitigate transmission unclear. In autumn 2020, Switzerland experienced one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe while keeping schools open, thus offering a high-exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and the evolution of clustering within classes and schools from June to November, 2020, in a prospective cohort study of school children in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland.

MethodsChildren from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited to participate in serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020. Parents of children filled questionnaires on sociodemographic and health-related questions. 55 schools and 275 classes within them were enrolled, with 2603 children participating in the first, and 2552 in the second testing (age range 6-16 years). We evaluated longitudinal changes of seroprevalence in districts and investigated clustering of seropositive cases within classes and schools.

ResultsOverall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CrI 1.4%-3.6%) in summer and 4.5% (95% CrI 3.2%-6.0%) in not previously seropositive children in late autumn, leading to estimated 7.8% (95% CrI 6.2%-9.5%) of ever seropositive children, without significant differences among lower, middle and upper school levels. Among the 2223 children with serology tested twice, 28 (40%) of previously seropositive were negative, and 109 (5%) previously negative became seropositive. Seroprevalence was not different between school levels or sexes, but varied across districts (1.7% to 15.0%). Between June-July and October-November 2020, the ratio of diagnosed to newly seropositive children was 1 to 8. At least one newly seropositive child was detected in 47 of 55 schools and 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with high participation rate, 0, 1-2 or [&ge;]3 seropositive children were present in 73 (56%), 50 (38%) and 7 (5%) classes, respectively. Class level explained slightly more variation of individual serological results (standard deviation of random effects (SD) 0.97) than school level (SD 0.61) in the multilevel logistic regression models. Symptoms were reported for 22% of seronegative and 29% of newly seropositive children since summer.

ConclusionsUnder a regimen of open schools with some preventive measures in place since August, clustering of seropositive cases occurred in very few classes and not across entire schools despite a clear increase in seropositive children during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

207,A longitudinal seroprevalence study in a large cohort of working adults reveals that neutralising SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies persist for at least six months independent of the severity of symptoms,"BackgroundIn spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wave in Europe, we set up an assay system for large-scale testing of virus-specific and protective antibodies including their longevity.

MethodsWe analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months.

FindingsWe found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG-borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising antibodies.

InterpretationRBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of both seroprevalence and seroprotection.

FundingThis study received funding from the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research within the research framework in relation to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (GZ 2020 0225 104).

Key pointsPersistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depends on their specificity. Total RBD-specific antibodies are those that are stable for up to at least six months and correlate best with neutralisation independent of the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSAt the beginning of the study (early pandemic in April 2020), the SARS-Cov-2 specific seroprevalence was totally unknown. Additionally, S1-specific antibody assays being the first on the market were tested with limited sample size showing a lower sensitivity and specificity at that time. Furthermore, at that time, there were no unambiguous interpretations of antibody test results with regard to immunity/protection against reinfection. It was also not clear whether the detection of different antibody specificities could yield an essential input into the interpretation of the antibodys qualities. Another open question was how long antibodies of the various specificities as well as antibodies with protective capacities would persist.

Added value of this studyWe provide data to confirm the most reliable correlation of RBD-specific antibodies with neutralising antibodies that are stable for at least six months. S1- and NCP-specific antibodies wane more quickly than RBD-specific antibodies, rendering them not as ideal candidates for longitudinal seroprevalence studies. Concerning symptoms, anosmia/dysgeusia was strongly associated with NT-seropositivity and seroprotection in the overall study population.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur data suggest that RBD-specific total antibody measurements with assays of high specificity can be used for cross-sectional as well as longitudinal seroepidemiological studies, even in low-prevalence settings. Detection of these antibodies also indicates robust seroprotection for at least six months. Due to the substantial loss of S1- and NCP-specific antibodies within the first months, assays targeting these antigen specificities - in contrast to RBD-specific antibody measurements - are not optimal to assess the duration of seroprotection. Overall, respiratory symptoms alone were not useful in predicting a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, anosmia/dysgeusia appeared to be a significant diagnostic marker, in particular for mild COVID-19.",Angelika Wagner; Angela Guzek; Johanna Ruff; Joanna Jasinska; Ute Scheikl; Ines Zwazl; Michael Kundi; Hannes Stockinger; Maria R.

208,Several forms of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in wastewaters : implication for wastewater-based epidemiology and risk assessment.,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a public health emergency of international concern. Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be mainly transmitted by inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols, SARS-CoV-2 is also detected in human feces and in raw wastewaters suggesting that other routes of infection may exist. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters has been proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human population connected to wastewater network. The understanding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through wastewater surveillance, the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral RNA genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment. Using an integrity based RT-qPCR assay this study led to the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist under several forms in wastewaters, which provides important information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters and associated risk assessment.

209,Social disparities in the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany: A county-scale explainable machine learning approach,"BackgroundLittle is known about factors correlated with this geographic spread of the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany. Given the lack of individual-level socioeconomic information on COVID-19 cases, we resorted to an ecological study design, exploring regional correlates of COVID-19 diagnoses.

Data and MethodWe used data from the Robert-Koch-Institute on COVID-19 diagnoses by sex, age (age groups: 0-4, 5-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, 80+), county (NUTS3 region) differentiating five periods (initial phase: through 15 March; 1st lockdown period: 16 March to 31 March; 2nd lockdown period: from 1 April to 15 April; easing period: 16 April to 30 April; post-lockdown period: 1 May through 23 July). For each period we calculated age-standardized incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses on the county level, using the German age distribution from the year 2018. We characterized the regions by macro variables in nine domains: ""Demography"", ""Employment"", ""Politics, religion, and education"", ""Income"", ""Settlement structure and environment"", ""Health care"", ""(structural) Poverty"", ""Interrelationship with other regions"", and ""Geography"". We trained gradient boosting models to predict the age-standardized incidence rates with the macro structures of the counties, and used SHAP values to characterize the 20 most prominent features in terms of negative/positive correlations with the outcome variable.

ResultsThe change in the age-standardized incidence rates over time is reflected in the changing importance of features as indicated by the mean SHAP values for the five periods. The first COVID-19 wave started as a disease in wealthy rural counties in southern Germany, and ventured into poorer urban and agricultural counties during the course of the first wave. The negative social gradient became more pronounced from the 2nd lockdown period onwards, when wealthy counties appeared to be better protected. Population density per se does not appear to be a risk factor, and only in the post-lockdown period did connectedness become an important regional characteristic correlated with higher infections. Features related to economic and educational characteristics of the young population in a county played an important role at the beginning of the pandemic up to the 2nd lockdown phase, as did features related to the population living in nursing homes; those related to international migration and a large proportion of foreigners living in a county became important in the post-lockdown period.

DiscussionIn the absence of individual level data, explainable machine learning methods based on regional data may help to better understand the changing nature of the drivers of the pandemic. High mobility of high SES groups may drive the pandemic at the beginning of waves, while mitigation measures and beliefs about the seriousness of the pandemic as well as the compliance with mitigation measures put lower SES groups at higher risks later on.",Gabriele Doblhammer; Constantin Reinke; Daniel Kreft,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248386,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248386,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
210,"Prioritizing Risk Groups for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination ""By the Numbers""","BackgroundGiven the limited supply of two COVID-19 vaccines, it will be important to choose which risk groups to prioritize for vaccination in order to get the most health benefits from that supply.

MethodIn order to help decide how to get the maximum health yield from this limited supply, we implemented a logistic regression model to predict COVID-19 death risk by age, race, and sex and did the same to predict COVID-19 case risk.

ResultsOur predictive model ranked all demographic groups by COVID-19 death risk. It was highly concentrated in some demographic groups, e.g. 85+ year old Black, Non-Hispanic patients suffered 1,953 deaths per 100,000. If we vaccinated the 17 demographic groups at highest COVID-19 death ranked by our logistic model, it would require only 3.7% of the vaccine supply needed to vaccinate all the United States, and yet prevent 47% of COVID-19 deaths. Nursing home residents had a higher COVID-19 death risk at 5,200 deaths/100,000, more than our highest demographic risk group. Risk of prison residents and health care workers (HCW) were lower than that of our demographic groups with the highest risks.

We saw much less concentration of COVID-19 case risk in any demographic groups compared to the high concentration of COVID-19 death in some such groups. We should prioritize vaccinations with the goal of reducing deaths, not cases, while the vaccine supply is low.

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 infection and thus against COVID-19 death per vaccine studies. Allocating at least some of the early vaccine supplies to high risk demographic groups could maximize lives saved. Our model, and the risk estimate it produced, could help states define their vaccine allocation rules.",Clement J McDonald; Seo Hyon Baik; Zhaonian Zheng; Liz Amos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248504,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248504,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
211,A DNA INTERCALATING DYE-BASED RT-QPCR ALTERNATIVE TO DIAGNOSE SARS-COV-2,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEarly detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proven crucial during the efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several diagnostic methods have emerged in the past few months, each with different shortcomings and limitations. The current gold standard, RT-qPCR using fluorescent probes, relies on demanding equipment requirements plus the high costs of the probes and specific reaction mixes. To broaden the possibilities of reagents and thermocyclers that could be allocated towards this task, we have optimized an alternative strategy for RT-qPCR diagnosis. This is based on a widely used DNA-intercalating dye and can be implemented with several different qPCR reagents and instruments. Remarkably, the proposed qPCR method performs similarly to the broadly used TaqMan-based detection, in terms of specificity and sensitivity, thus representing a reliable tool. We think that, through enabling the use of vast range of thermocycler models and laboratory facilities for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the alternative proposed here can increase dramatically the testing capability, especially in countries with limited access to costly technology and reagents.",Federico Fuchs Wightman; Micaela Godoy Herz; Juan Cristobal Munoz; Jose Nicolas Stigliano; Laureano Bragado; Nicolas Nieto Moreno; Marcos Palavecino; Lucas Servi; Gonzalo Cabrerizo; Jose Clemente; Martin Avaro; Andrea Pontoriero; Estefania Benedetti; Elsa Baumeister; Fabian Rudolf; Federico Remes Lenicov; - COVID-19-INBIRS working group; Cybele Garcia; Valeria Buggiano; Alberto R.

212,A Working Model to Inform Risk-Based Back to Work Strategies,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many businesses to close or move to remote work to reduce the potential spread of disease. Employers desiring a return to onsite work want to understand their risk for having an infected employee on site and how best to mitigate this risk. Here, we modelled a range of key metrics to help inform return to work policies and procedures, including evaluating the benefit and optimal design of a SARS-CoV-2 employee screening program.

MethodsWe modeled a range of input variables including prevalence of COVID-19, time infected, number of employees, test sensitivity and specificity, test turnaround time, number of times tested within the infectious period, and sample pooling. We modeled the impact of these input variables on several output variables: number of healthy employees; number of infected employees; number of test positive and test negative employees; number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative employees; positive and negative predictive values; and time an infected, potentially contagious employee is on site.

ResultsWe show that an employee screening program can reduce the risk for onsite transmission across different prevalence values and group sizes. For example, at a pre-test asymptomatic community prevalence of 0.5% (5 in 1000) with an employee group size of 500, the risk for at least one infected employee on site is 91.8%, with 3 asymptomatic infected employees predicted within those 500 employees. Implementing a SARS-CoV-2 baseline screen with an 80% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity would reduce the risk of at least one infected employee on site to 39.4% and the predicted number of infected employees onsite (false negatives) to 1. Repetitive testing is required for ongoing vigilance of onsite employees. The expected number of days an infected employee is on site depends on test sensitivity, testing interval, and turnaround time. If the test interval is longer than the infectious period ([~]14 days for COVID-19), testing will not detect the infected employee. Sample pooling reduces the number of tests performed, thereby reducing testing costs. However, the pooling methodology (eg, 1-stage vs 2-stage pooling, pool size) will impact the number of employees that screen positive, thereby affected the number of employees eligible to return to onsite work.

ConclusionsThe modeling presented here can be used to help employers understand their risk for having an infected employee on site. Further, it details how an employee screening program can reduce this risk and shows how screening performance and frequency impact the effectiveness of a screening program. The primary factors determining the effectiveness of a screening program are test sensitivity and frequency of testing.

213,Development and external validation of a logistic regression derived formula based on repeated routine hematological measurements predicting survival of hospitalized Covid-19 patients,"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has become a global public health crisis and providing optimal patient care while preventing a collapse of the health care system is a principal objective worldwide.

ObjectiveTo develop and validate a prognostic model based on routine hematological parameters to predict uncomplicated disease progression to support the decision for an earlier discharge.

DesignDevelopment and refinement of a multivariable logistic regression model with subsequent external validation. The time course of several hematological variables until four days after admission were used as predictors. Variables were first selected based on subject matter knowledge; their number was further reduced using likelihood ratio-based backward elimination in random bootstrap samples.

SettingModel development based on three Austrian hospitals, validation cohorts from two Austrian and one Swedish hospital.

ParticipantsModel development based on 363 survivors and 78 non-survivors of Covid-19 hospitalized in Austria. External validation based on 492 survivors and 61 non-survivors hospitalized in Austria and Sweden.

OutcomeIn-hospital death.

Main ResultsThe final model includes age, fever upon admission, parameters derived from C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, platelet count and creatinine concentration, approximating their baseline values (CRP, creatinine) and change over time (CRP, platelet count). In Austrian validation cohorts both discrimination and calibration of this model were good, with c indices of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) in a cohort from Vienna and 0.93 (0.88 - 0.98) in one from Linz. The model performance seems independent of how long symptoms persisted before admission. In a small Swedish validation cohort, the model performance was poorer (p = 0.008) compared with Austrian cohorts with a c index of 0.77 (0.67 - 0.88), potentially due to substantial differences in patient demographics and clinical routine.

ConclusionsHere we describe a formula, requiring only variables routinely acquired in hospitals, which allows to estimate death probabilities of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The model could be used as a decision support for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system. The model could further be used to monitor whether patients should be admitted to hospital in countries with health care systems with emphasis on outpatient care (e.g. Sweden).",Stefan Heber; David Pereyra; Waltraud Schrottmaier; Kerstin Kammerer; Jonas Santol; Erich Pawelka; Markus Hana; Alexander Scholz; Markus Liu; Agnes Hell; Klara Heiplik; Benno Lickefett; Sebastian Haverall; Marianna Traugott; Matthias Neuboeck; Christian Schoergenhofer; Tamara Seitz; Christa Firbas; Mario Karolyi; Guenter Weiss; Bernd Jilma; Charlotte Thalin; Rosa Bellmann-Weiler; Helmut Salzer; Michael JM Fischer; Alexander Zoufaly; Alice Assinger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248563,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248563,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
214,How to coordinate vaccination and social distancing to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks,"The world is waiting for a vaccine to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, once it becomes available, there will not be enough to vaccinate everybody at once. Therefore, vaccination and social distancing has to be coordinated. In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision making we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run without overburdening the intensive care units it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group. Furthermore, large amounts of a vaccine with a lower success rate allows for more reduction of the social distancing than smaller amounts of a vaccine with higher success rate.",Sara Grundel; Stefan Heyder; Thomas Hotz; Tobias K.

ResultsStudy participants, particularly female farmworkers, reported adverse effects of the pandemic on their mental health and home environment (e.g., 24% overall reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms). The pandemic also resulted in greater financial burden for many farmworkers, with 37% food insecure and 51% unable to pay bills. Half of respondents reported that they were extremely likely to be vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy was most common in participants who were women, younger, born in the United States, and living in more rural areas.

216,Impact of housing conditions on changes in youth's mental health following the initial national COVID-19 lockdown: A cohort study,"BackgroundYouths mental health has on average declined initially during the pandemic and few studies have investigated whether these declines were dependent on housing conditions.

MethodsWe used data from 7445 youth from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), collected at participants 18th year of life and subsequently three weeks into the initial national lockdown (April 2020). We examined associations between housing conditions (access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition) and changes in mental health parameters (mental well-being, Quality of Life (QoL) and loneliness. We report results from multivariate linear and logistic regression models.

FindingsYouth without access to outdoor spaces had a greater decrease in mental well-being compared to those with a garden, mean difference: -0{middle dot}83 (95 % CI -1{middle dot}19,-0{middle dot}48), and correspondingly greater odds of onset of low mental well-being, OR: 1{middle dot}68 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}15, 2{middle dot}47). Youth in higher density households and those living alone also had greater odds of onset of low mental well-being (OR: 1{middle dot}23 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}05, 1{middle dot}43) and OR: 1{middle dot}47 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}05, 2{middle dot}07), respectively). Onset of low QoL was associated with living in denser households, as well as living alone. Living alone more than doubled odds of onset of loneliness, OR: 2{middle dot}12 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}59, 2{middle dot}82).

InterpretationNot all youth were equally affected by the pandemic and our findings inform policy makers that youth living alone, in denser households, and without direct access to outdoor spaces are especially vulnerable to mental health declines.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMental health is associated with certain housing characteristics, such as access to green space and household composition. Additionally, we know that mental health amongst youth has been especially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and/or social restrictions, at a time where a majority of youth spend more time at home. Cross-sectional studies have indicated that housing conditions during the initial lockdowns were associated with mental health among youth.

Added value to this studyWe are able to provide evidence that housing conditions have been important factors in how youths mental health has changed, due to data collections in our cohort before and during the pandemic. We demonstrate that living alone without access to outdoor spaces and in denser households during lockdown are all associated with deteriorations in mental health in a longitudinal design. The deteriorations in mental well-being are at a level indicative of anxiety and/or depression, indicating that these mental health changes are meaningful from a public health perspective. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine associations longitudinally in a youth cohort.

Implications of all the available evidenceNot all youth will be equally affected by the pandemic and social restrictions. Public health recommendations could be that youth avoid living alone, in dense households and without access to outdoor spaces during a lockdown, if this is at all possible to choose. Additionally, mental health and public health professionals should be aware of these vulnerabilities as they seek to assist youth at times when social restrictions are in place to control community transmission. Additionally, as we look to the future and work towards equitable and health-promoting housing, we must consider aspects that are important to mental health during pandemics and otherwise.",Jonathan Groot; Amélie Cléo Keller; Andrea Joensen; Tri-Long Nguyen; Anne-Marie Nybo Andersen; Katrine Strandberg-Larsen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
217,Population Changes in Seroprevalence among a Statewide Sample in the United States,"Antibody surveillance provides essential information for public health officials to work with communities to discuss the spread and impact of COVID-19 in communities. At the state of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the diagnostic testing was limited with many asymptomatic cases. Irrespective of symptom severity, antibodies develop within two to three weeks after disease onset and may persist 6 months or more, antibody surveillance is an important tool for tracking trends in past infections across diverse populations. This study includes adults and children recruited from a statewide sample of past 2014-2020 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) participants. SHOW, an ongoing population-based health examination study including a randomly selected sample of households, partnered with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene to conduct longitudinal antibody surveillance using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. WAVEs I and II of three planned WAVES were complete in mid-summer to late fall respectively, WAVE III is planned for early 2021. From WAVE I to WAVE II, crude estimates of seroprevalence in the total study population increased four to five-fold from 1.9% to 7.3%. Within the statewide probability sample, weighted estimates increased from an estimated 1.6% (95% CI:0.6-2.5%) seropositivity to 6.8% (95% CI:4.3-9.4%). Seroprevalence varied by health region in both waves, and significant disparities in smaller population groups were identified. Although there was no gender difference observed in WAVE I, seropositivity rates was higher in men 9.4% (95% CI:4.3, 14.3) compared to women 4.3% (2.7-5.3%) in WAVE II.

218,Assessment of effective mitigation and prediction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany using demographic information and spatial resolution,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are important to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases as long as no vaccination or outstanding medical treatments are available. We assess the effectiveness of the sets of non-pharmaceutical interventions that were in place during the course of the Coron-avirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Germany. Our results are based on hybrid models, combining SIR-type models on local scales with spatial resolution. In order to account for the age-dependence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we include realistic pre-pandemic and recently recorded contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions will occur on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. In order to account for spatial heterogeneity, we use a graph approach and we include high-quality information on commuting activities combined with traveling information from social networks. The remaining uncertainty will be accounted for by a large number of randomized simulation runs. Based on the derived factors for the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions over the past months, we provide different forecast scenarios for the upcoming time.

219,COVID-19: An analysis of social media and research publication activity during the early stages of the pandemic,"ObjectivesThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discovery. Social media (SoMe) has become an invaluable platform in science and medicine. This study analyzed activity of SoMe (Twitter), preprints, and publications related to COVID-19 and gastroenterology (GI) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsData from Twitter, preprint servers and PubMed was collected and analyzed from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity; any associations were identified.

ResultsOver the 6-month period, there were 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7,164 publications, and 4,702 preprints. Twitter activity peaked during March while preprints and publications peaked in April 2020. Strong correlations were identified between Twitter and both preprints and publications activity (p<0.001 for both). While COVID-19 data across the 3 platforms concentrated on pulmonology/critical care, the majority of GI tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal GI (LGI). There were significant associations between Twitter activity and research for all GI subfields (p=0.009 for LGI, p=0.006 for hepatology and IBD, p=0.007 for endoscopy), except pancreatology (p=0.2). Twitter activity was highest in the US (7,331 tweets) whereas PubMed activity was highest in China (1,768 publications).

220,Occupational exposures associated with being a COVID-19 case; evidence from three case-control studies,"BackgroundThe evidence on risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings is sparse, yet this information is key to inform public health action. We investigated factors associated with being a COVID-19 case using data collected through contact tracing.

MethodsWe conducted three retrospective, frequency-matched case-control studies between August 2020 and October 2020 using case data from the NHS Test and Trace programme. Controls were obtained through Market Research Panels. Multivariable analyses provided adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for multiple community exposure settings. We analysed the results in meta-analyses using random effects models to obtain pooled odds ratios (pORs).

ResultsAcross all study periods, there was strong statistical evidence that working in healthcare (pOR 2.87, aOR range 2.72-3.08), social care (pOR 4.15, aOR range 2.46-5.41) or hospitality (pOR 2.36, aOR range 2.01-2.63) were associated with increased odds of being a COVID-19 case. There was also evidence that working in warehouse setting was associated with increased odds (pOR 3.86, aOR range 1.06-14.19), with a substantial increase in odds observed over the study periods. A similar pattern was also observed in education and construction.

ConclusionsThe studies indicate that some workplace settings are associated with increased odds of being a case. However, it is not possible to determine how much of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 took place within the workplace, and how much was associated with social, household or transport exposures.",Iina Hiironen; Maria Saavedra-Campos; Jennifer Panitz; Thomas Ma; Olisaeloka Nsonwu; Andre Charlett; Gareth Hughes; Isabel Oliver,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248161,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248161,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
221,In Vitro Safety Clinical Trial of the Cardiac Liability of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as COVID19 Polytherapy,"Despite global efforts, there are no effective FDA-approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential therapeutics focus on repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. Here we report on a preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing.

Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8.. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection.

The cardiac MPS can predict clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities.

223,Transcriptional and epi-transcriptional dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during cellular infection,"SARS-CoV-2 uses subgenomic (sg)RNA to produce viral proteins for replication and immune evasion. We applied long-read RNA and cDNA sequencing to in vitro human and primate infection models to study transcriptional dynamics. Transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent sgRNA was upregulated earlier in infection than TRS-independent sgRNA. An abundant class of TRS-independent sgRNA consisting of a portion of ORF1ab containing nsp1 joined to ORF10 and 3UTR was upregulated at 48 hours post infection in human cell lines. We identified double-junction sgRNA containing both TRS-dependent and independent junctions. We found multiple sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 genome is consistently more modified than sgRNA, and that sgRNA modifications are stable across transcript clusters, host cells and time since infection.

224,Evolutionary tracking of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants highlights intricate balance of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations,"The currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has accounted for millions of infections and deaths across the globe. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are being published daily in various forums and this big data availability has allowed unprecedented access into the mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Genomic information has further been utilised in public health decision making through molecular epidemiology, transmission tracking and vaccine design. We made use of the same sea of genomic information for conducting a detailed phylogenetic analysis and identifying lineage- specific mutations. The catalogued mutations were analysed for their stabilizing or destabilizing impact on E, M, N and S viral proteins that are key for infection, virulence and pathogenesis. The same proteins make crucial components of vaccines recently approved and in development. We recorded positive natural selection of D614G, S477N, A222V V1176F variants and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1. In addition, a positive natural selection of Q57H (B.1.X), R203K/G204R (B.1.1.X), T85I (B.1.2-B.1.3), G15S+T428I (C.X) and I120F (D.X) variants was observed. Overall, we recorded a striking balance between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, therefore incredibly well maintained protein structures. With selection pressures in the form of newly developed vaccines and therapeutics to mount soon in coming months, the task of mapping of viral mutations and recording of their impact on key viral proteins would be crucial to pre-emptively catch any escape mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 may evolve for.",Jobin John Jacob; Karthick Vasudevan; Agila Kumari Pragasam; Karthik Gunasekaran; Gagandeep Kang; Balaji Veeraraghavan; Ankur Mutreja,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423920,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423920,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,False
225,SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance in Costa Rica: Evidence of a Divergent Population and an Increased Detection of a Spike T1117I Mutation,"Genome sequencing is a key strategy in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. Latin America is the hardest hit region of the world, accumulating almost 25% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. Costa Rica was first exemplary for the region in its pandemic control, declaring a swift state of emergency on March 16th that led to a low quantity of cases, until measures were lifted in early May. From the first detected case in March 6th to November 30th almost 140 000 cases have been reported in Costa Rica, 99.5% of them from May onwards. We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 138 sequences, 52 from the first months of the pandemic, and 86 from the current wave.

Three GISAID clades (G, GH, and GR) and three PANGOLIN lineages (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.291) are predominant, with phylogenetic relationships that are in line with the results of other Latin American countries suggesting introduction and multiple re-introductions from other regions of the world. The sequences from the first months of the pandemic grouped in lineage B.1 and B.1.5 mainly, suggesting low undetected circulation and re-introductions of new lineages not detected in the country during early stages of the pandemic due to the extreme lockdown measures. The wholegenome variant calling analysis identified a total of 177 distinct variants. These correspond mostly to non-synonymous mutations (54.8%, 97) but 41.2% (73) corresponded to synonymous mutations. The 177 variants showed an expected power-law distribution: 106 single nucleotide mutations were identified in single sequences, only 16 single nucleotide mutations were found in >5% sequences, and only three single nucleotide mutations in >25% genomes. These mutations were distributed all over the genome. However, 61.5% were present in ORF1ab, and 15.0% in Spike gene and 9.6% in the Nucleocapsid. Additionally, the prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike (98.6% in Costa Rica), ORF8 L84S (1.5%) is similar to what is found elsewhere. Interestingly, the prevalence of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica, reaching 14.5% detection in the full genome analyses in August 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences in other countries. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggest a possible effect on the viral oligomerization needed for cell infection. Nevertheless, in-vitro experiments are required to prove this in-silico analyses. In conclusion, genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggests re-introduction of lineages from other countries as travel bans and measures were lifted, similar to results found in other studies, but the Spike-T1117I variant needs to be monitored and studied in further analyses as part of the surveillance program during the pandemic.",Jose Arturo Molina Mora Sr.; Estela Cordero-Laurent; Adriana Godinez; Melany Calderon; Hebleen Brenes; Claudio Soto-Garita; Cristian Perez-Corrales; - COINGESA-CR Consorcio Interinstitucional de Estudios Genomicos del SARS-CoV-2 Costa Rica; Jan Felix Drexler; Andres Moreira-Soto; Eugenia Corrales-Aguilar; Francisco Duarte-Martinez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423850,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423850,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,False
226,"SARS-CoV-2 testing of 11,884 healthcare workers at an acute NHS hospital trust in England: a retrospective analysis","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are known to be at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, although whether these risks are equal across all roles is uncertain. Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A logistic regression model adjusting for these factors showed significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk.

Many results have been described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized. In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical features and clinical laboratory values of patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets, higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing abrupt change in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity.

229,"Safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 (a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial) and the persistence of immune responses from a phase 1 follow-up report","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 {micro}g or 6 {micro}g) formulated with a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG). Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152: 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG.

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion ([&ge;]4-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT50). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose).

FindingsAmong 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92{middle dot}9% (88{middle dot}2, 96{middle dot}2) and 98{middle dot}3% (95{middle dot}1, 99{middle dot}6) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6{middle dot}9, 13{middle dot}2) and 10.3% (7{middle dot}4, 13{middle dot}8) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73{middle dot}5% (63{middle dot}6, 81{middle dot}9), 81{middle dot}1% (71{middle dot}4, 88{middle dot}1), and 73{middle dot}1% (62{middle dot}9, 81{middle dot}8) of individuals in the 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 {micro}g with Algel groups, respectively.

InterpretationIn the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The safety profile of BBV152 is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates. The 6 {micro}g Algel-IMDG formulation was selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial.

230,"Minimizing exposure to respiratory droplets, 'jet riders' and aerosols in air-conditioned hospital rooms by a 'Shield-and-Sink' strategy","ObjectivesIn COVID-19, transfer of respiratory materials transmits disease but the interplay of droplet and aerosol physics, physiology and environment is not fully understood. To advance understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and to find novel exposure minimization strategies, we studied cough-driven material transport modes and the efficacy of control strategies.

Design and methodsComputer simulations and real-world experiments were used for integrating an intensive care setting, multi- physics, and physiology. Patient-focused airflow management and air purification strategies were examined computationally and validated by submicron particle exhalation imaging in volunteers.

ResultsRespiratory materials ejected by cough exhibited four transport modes: long-distance ballistic, short- distance ballistic, ""jet rider"", and aerosol modes. Interaction with air conditioning driven flow contaminated a hospital room rapidly. Different than large droplets or aerosols, ""jet rider"" droplets travelled with the turbulent air jet initially, but fell out at a distance, were not well eliminated by air conditioning and exposed bystanders at larger distance and longer time; their size predisposes them to preferential capture in the nasal mucosa, the primordial COVID-19 infection site. ""Cough shields"" captured large droplets but induced lateral dispersion of aerosols and jet riders. An air purification device alone had limited efficacy. A ""Shield and Sink"" approach combining ""cough shields"" with ""virus sinks"" miminized exposure to all secretions in modeling and real-life experiments.

Conclusions""Jet riders"" have characteristics of highly efficient respiratory infection vectors and may play a role in Covid- 19 transmission. Exposure to all droplet types can be minimized through an easily implemented ""Shield and Sink"" strategy.

231,Immunological and pathological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 challenge after formalin-inactivated vaccine immunisation of ferrets and rhesus macaques,"There is an urgent requirement for safe and effective vaccines to prevent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. A concern for the development of new viral vaccines is the potential to induce vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). This was reported in several preclinical studies with both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS vaccines but has not been reported with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We have used ferret and rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to assess the potential for VED in animals vaccinated with formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (FIV) formulated with Alhydrogel, compared to a negative control vaccine in ferrets or unvaccinated macaques. We showed no evidence of enhanced disease in ferrets or rhesus macaques given FIV except for mild transient enhanced disease seen at seven days post infection in ferrets. This increased lung pathology was observed early in the infection (day 7) but was resolved by day 15. We also demonstrate that formaldehyde treatment of SARS-CoV-2 reduces exposure of the spike receptor binding domain providing a mechanistic explanation for suboptimal immunity.",Kevin R Bewley; Karen E R Gooch; Kelly M Thomas; Stephanie R Longet; Nathan Wiblin; Laura Hunter; Kin Chan; Phillip Brown; Rebecca A Russell; Catherine Ho; Gillian Slack; Holly E Humphries; Leonie Alden; Lauren Allen; Marilyn Aram; Natalie Baker; Emily Brunt; Rebecca Cobb; Susan Fotheringham; Debbie Harris; Chelsea Kennard; Stephanie Leung; Kathryn A Ryan; Howard Tolley; Nadina Wand; Andrew White; Laura Sibley; Charlotte Sarfas; Geoff Pearson; Emma Rayner; Xiaochao Xue; Teresa Lambe; Sue Charlton; Sarah C Gilbert; Quentin Sattentau; Fergus Gleeson; Yper Hall; Simon G.

232,A recombinant protein SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine elicits high-titer neutralizing antibodies in macaques.,"Vaccines that generate robust and long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently required. We assessed the potential of vaccine candidates based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike in cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) by examining their ability to generate spike binding antibodies with neutralizing activity. Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the NTD alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the RBD but not the NTD had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans. Neutralizing activity persisted for more than 20 weeks. These data support the utility of spike subunit-based antigens as a vaccine for use in humans.",Gary Baisa; David Rancour; Keith Mansfield; Monika Burns; Lori Martin; Daise Cunha; Jessica Fischer; Frauke Muecksch; Theodora Hatziioannou; Paul Bieniasz; Frtiz Schomburg; Kimberly Luke,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.422693,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.422693,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
233,Fatty Acid Synthase inhibition prevents palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 SpikeProtein and improves survival of mice infected with murine hepatitis virus.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the causative agent of COVID19 that has infected >76M people and caused >1.68M deaths. The SARS-CoV2 Spike glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment and infection of target cells. The viral Spike protein serves the basis for many putative therapeutic countermeasures including vaccines, blocking and neutralizing antibodies, and decoy receptors. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. The Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues conserved among coronavirus. Increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper-palmitoylation, while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced the ability of the human CoV 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase using the pharmacological inhibitor TVB-3166 eliminated palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 Spike. Additionally, TVB-3166 attenuated plaque formation and promoted the survival of mice from a lethal murine CoV infection. Thus, inhibition of the Spike protein palmitoylation has the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV infections.",Minhyoung Lee; Katrina Mekhail; Michael Sugiyama; Elyse Latreille; Costin N Antonescu; Greg D Fairn,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423603,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423603,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
234,In vitro measurements of protein-protein interactions show that antibody affinity governs the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 binding in convalescent serum,"The humoral immune response plays a key role in suppressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2-spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the binding energies of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein, and the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential areas of application ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.",Sebastian Fiedler; Monika A.

235,Evidence of a dysregulated Vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infected patient's lung cells,"Although a defective vitamin D pathway has been widely suspected to be associated in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the status of the vitamin D pathway and vitamin D-modulated genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patients cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-{kappa}B/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Bijesh George; Ravikumar Amjesh; Aswathy Mary Paul; Santhosh Kumar TR; Madhavan Radhakrishna Pillai; Rakesh Kumar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423733,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423733,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
236,From infection to immunity: understanding the response to SARS-CoV2 through in-silico modeling,"BackgroundImmune system conditions of the patient is a key factor in COVID-19 infection survival. A growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for therapies.

AimThe dynamics of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of the both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and therapies. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the management of the infection: can we describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19? The in-silico model developed here answers this question at individual (personalized) and population levels.

We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity to the ACE2 receptor and age in the artificially infected population on the course of the disease.

MethodsWe use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of infected individuals with age-dependent varying degree of immune competence. We use a parameter setting to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics.

ResultsWe reproduce in-silico a number of clinical observations and we identify critical factors in the statistical evolution of the infection. In particular we evidence the importance of the humoral response over the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection is a prognostic factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection.

Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of simulating the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed is able to explain and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions.

Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes in a quantitative way that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population.

In this work we i) show the power of model predictions, ii) identify the clinical end points that could be more suitable for computational modeling of COVID-19 immune response, iii) define the resolution and amount of data required to empower this class of models for translational medicine purposes and, iv) we exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important light to discuss hypothesis and design new experiments.",Filippo Castiglione; Debashrito Deb; Anurag P.

237,"Prevalent, protective, and convergent IgG recognition of SARS-CoV-2 non-RBD spike epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent plasma","Although humoral immunity is essential for control of SARS-CoV-2, the molecular composition, binding epitopes and effector functions of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that circulate in blood plasma following infection are unknown. Proteomic deconvolution of the circulating IgG repertoire (Ig-Seq1) to the spike ectodomain (S-ECD2) in four convalescent study subjects revealed that the plasma response is oligoclonal and directed predominantly (>80%) to S-ECD epitopes that lie outside the receptor binding domain (RBD). When comparing antibodies directed to either the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) or the S2 subunit (S2) in one subject, just four IgG lineages (1 anti-S2, 2 anti-NTD and 1 anti-RBD) accounted for 93.5% of the repertoire. Although the anti-RBD and one of the anti-NTD antibodies were equally potently neutralizing in vitro, we nonetheless found that the anti-NTD antibody was sufficient for protection to lethal viral challenge, either alone or in combination as a cocktail where it dominated the effect of the other plasma antibodies. We identified in vivo protective plasma anti-NTD antibodies in 3/4 subjects analyzed and discovered a shared class of antibodies targeting the NTD that utilize unmutated or near-germline IGHV1-24, the most electronegative IGHV gene in the human genome. Structural analysis revealed that binding to NTD is dominated by interactions with the heavy chain, accounting for 89% of the entire interfacial area, with germline residues uniquely encoded by IGHV1-24 contributing 20% (149 [A]2). Together with recent reports of germline IGHV1-24 antibodies isolated by B-cell cloning3,4 our data reveal a class of shared IgG antibodies that are readily observed in convalescent plasma and underscore the role of NTD-directed antibodies in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",William N Voss; Yixuan J Hou; Nicole V Johnson; Jin Eyun Kim; George Delidakis; Andrew P Horton; Foteini Bartzoka; Chelsea J Paresi; Yuri Tanno; Shawn A Abbasi; Whitney Pickens; Katia George; Daniel R Boutz; Dalton M Towers; Jonathan R McDaniel; Daniel Billick; Jule Goike; Lori Rowe; Dhwani Batra; Jan Pohl; Justin Lee; Shivaprakash Gangappa; Suryaprakash Sambhara; Michelle Gadush; Nianshuang Wang; Maria D Person; Brent L Iverson; Jimmy D Gollihar; John Dye; Andrew Herbert; Ralph S Baric; Jason S McLellan; George Georgiou; Jason J Lavinder; Gregory C Ippolito,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423708,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423708,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
238,Binding strength and hydrogen bond numbers between Covid-19 RBD and HVR of antibody,"The global battle against the Covid-19 pandemic relies strongly on the human defence of antibody, which is assumed to bind the antigens Receptor Binding Domain with its Hypervariable Region. Due to the similarity to other viruses such as SARS, however, our understanding of the antibody-virus interaction has been largely limited to the genomic sequencing, which poses serious challenges to the containment, vaccine exploration and rapid serum testing. Based on the physical/chemical nature of the interaction, infrared spectroscopy was employed to reveal the binding disparity, when unusual temperature dependence was discovered from the 1550cm-1 absorption band, attributed to the hydrogen bonds by carboxyl/amino groups, binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. The infrared absorption intensity, associated with the number of hydrogen bonds, was found to increase sharply between 27{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, with the relative absorbance matches at 37{degrees}C the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types (19 vs 12). Meanwhile the ratio of bonds at 27{degrees}C, calculated by thermodynamic exponentials rather than by the laymans guess, produces at least 5% inaccuracy. As a result, the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody will be more conclusive beyond 31{degrees}C, instead of at the usual room temperature of 20{degrees}C - 25{degrees}C, when the vaccine research and antibody diagnosis would likely be undermined. Beyond genomic sequencing, the temperature dependence, as well as the bond number match at 37{degrees}C between relative absorbance and the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types, are not only of clinical significance in particular, but also of a sample for the physical/chemical understanding of the vaccine-antibody interactions in general.",Ryan Taoran Wang; Alex Fan Xu; Qi Zhou; Tinglu Song; Kelvin J.

239,The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein disrupts the cooperative function of human cardiac pericytes - endothelial cells through CD147 receptor-mediated signalling: a potential non-infective mechanism of COVID-19 microvascular disease,"BackgroundSevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests as a life-threatening microvascular syndrome. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction.

MethodsWe investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes (PCs) signalling and function. Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells (ECs) in angiogenesis assays, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs.

FindingsWe show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs. Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein.

InterpretationOur findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implication.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. Co-receptors and host cell proteases may also be involved. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the well-recognized entry receptor used by the virus in respiratory epithelial cells; it is also abundantly expressed in the human heart. Alongside ACE2, CD147 has recently emerged as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, it is not clear if SARS-CoV-2 triggers adverse responses in cardiac vascular mural cells. Likewise, no investigation was devoted to verifying if the recombinant S protein alone can mimic the whole virus signalling.

Added value of this studyThis study provides the first evidence that the recombinant S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is capable of eliciting cellular signalling in human cardiac pericytes, thereby inducing cell dysfunction. In addition, this study proposes CD147 as the leading receptor mediating S protein signalling in cardiac pericytes.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese reports imply that fragments of the S protein might be able to elicit vascular cell dysfunction. Blocking the CD147 receptor may help protect the vasculature not only from infection, but also from the collateral damage caused by the S protein.",Elisa Avolio; Monica Gamez; Kapil Gupta; Rebecca Foster; Imre Berger; Massimo Caputo; Andrew  D.

240,In vitro characterization of engineered red blood cells as potent viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,"Engineered red blood cells (RBCs) expressing viral receptors could be used therapeutically as viral traps as RBCs lack nuclei and other organelles required for viral replication. Here we show that the combination of a powerful erythroid-specific expression system and transgene codon optimization yields high expression levels of the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5, as well as a CD4-glycophorin A (CD4-GpA) fusion protein on enucleated RBCs. Engineered RBCs expressing CD4 and CCR5 were efficiently infected by HIV-1, but CD4 or CD4-GpA expression in the absence of CCR5 was sufficient to potently neutralize HIV-1 in vitro. To facilitate continuous large-scale production of engineered RBCs, we generated erythroblast cell lines stably expressing CD4-GpA or ACE2-GpA fusion proteins, which produced potent RBC viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

241,pH and Receptor Induced Confirmational Changes- Implications Towards S1 Dissociation of SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoprotein,"Viruses, being obligate intracellular parasites, must first attach themselves and gain entry into host cells. Viral fusion machinery is the central player in the viral attachment process in almost every viral disease. Viruses have incorporated an array of efficient fusion proteins on their surfaces to bind efficiently to host cell receptors. They make use of the host proteolytic enzymes to rearrange their surface protein(s) into the form which facilitates their binding to host-cell membrane proteins and subsequently, fusion. This stage of viral entry is very critical and has many therapeutic implications. The current global pandemic of COVID-19 has sparked severe health crisis and economic shutdowns. SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent of the disease has led to millions of deaths and brought the scientific community together in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis and mortality. Like other viral fusion machinery, CoV2 spike (S) glycoprotein-  The Demogorgon poses the same questions about viral-host cell fusion. The intermediate stages of S protein-mediated viral fusion are unclear owing to the lack of structural insights and concrete biochemical evidence. The mechanism of conformational transition is still unclear. S protein binding and fusion with host cell receptors, Eg., angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is accompanied by cleavage of S1/S2 subunits. To track the key events of viral-host cell fusion, we have identified (in silico) that low pH-induced conformational change and ACE-2 binding events promote S1 dissociation.

Here, using an objective analytical method, we present the changes in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19 over time. The virus has mutated in three major directions 2, with three groups remaining to date. The basic structure of the groups was completed by April and shared across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of a second or third peak. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of which the virus overcame previously effective protections. Currently, each country may possess such a unique stronger variant, which may cause another peak in other countries. These viruses could also serve as sources of mutations by exchanging parts of the genome.

We also found that CPC and CPC-containing mouth rinses decreased a thousand times the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, while the corresponding vehicles had no effect.

244,Mutation Landscape of SARS COV2 in Africa,"COVID-19 disease has had a relatively less severe impact in Africa. To understand the role of SARS CoV2 mutations on COVID-19 disease in Africa, we analysed 282 complete nucleotide sequences from African isolates deposited in the NCBI Virus Database. Sequences were aligned against the prototype Wuhan sequence (GenBank accession: NC_045512.2) in BWA v. 0.7.17. SAM and BAM files were created, sorted and indexed in SAMtools v. 1.10 and marked for duplicates using Picard v. 2.23.4. Variants were called with mpileup in BCFtools v. 1.11. Phylograms were created using Mr. Bayes v 3.2.6. A total of 2,349 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles across 294 sites were identified. Clades associated with severe disease in the United States, France, Italy, and Brazil had low frequencies in Africa (L84S=2.5%, L3606F=1.4%, L3606F/V378I/=0.35, G251V=2%). Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) accounted for only 3% of P323L and 4% of Q57H mutations in Africa. Comparatively low infections in SSA were attributed to the low frequency of the D614G clade in earlier samples (25% vs 67% global). Higher disease burden occurred in countries with higher D614G frequencies (Egypt=98%, Morocco=90%, Tunisia=52%, South Africa) with D614G as the first confirmed case. V367F, D364Y, V483A and G476S mutations associated with efficient ACE2 receptor binding and severe disease were not observed in Africa. 95% of all RdRp mutations were deaminations leading to CpG depletion and possible attenuation of virulence.

245,"The challenges of the coming mass vaccination and exit strategy in prevention and control of COVID-19, a modelling study","With success in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, it is urgent and challenging to analyse how the coming large-scale vaccination in the population and the growing public desire of relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) interact to impact the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using mathematical models, we focus on two aspects: 1) how the vaccination program should be designed to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs; 2) how much the vaccination coverage is needed to avoid a second wave of the epidemics when the NPIs exit in stages. We address this issue globally, and take six countries--China, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, UK, and US--in our case study. We showed that a dynamic vaccination program in three stages can be an effective approach to balance the dynamic exit of the NPIs in terms of mitigating the epidemics. The vaccination rates and the accumulative vaccination coverage in these countries are estimated by fitting the model to the real data. We observed that the required effective vaccination coverages are greatly different to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs in these countries, providing a quantitative criterion for the requirement of an integrative package of NPIs. We predicted the epidemics under different vaccination rates for these countries, and showed that the vaccination can significantly decrease the peak value of a future wave. Furthermore, we found that a lower vaccination coverage can result in a subsequent wave once the NPIs exit. Therefore, there is a critical (minimum) vaccination coverage, depending on effectiveness of NPIs to avoid a subsequent wave. We estimated the critical vaccination coverages for China, Brazil, and Indonesia under different scenarios. In conclusion, we quantitatively showed that the dynamic vaccination program can be the effective approach to supplement or even eventually replace NPIs in mitigating the epidemics and avoiding future waves, and we suggest that country level-based exit strategies of the NPIs should be considered, according to the possible quarantine rate and testing ability, and the accessibility, affordability and efficiency of the vaccines.",Biao Tang; Peiyu Liu; Jie Yang; Jianhong Wu; Yanni Xiao; Sanyi Tang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248478,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248478,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True

ParticipantsThe study utilized a national sample to create cohorts from a de-identified dataset composed of commercial laboratory test results, open and closed medical and pharmacy claims, electronic health records, hospital billing (chargemaster) data, and payer enrollment files from the United States. Patients were indexed as antibody-positive or antibody-negative according to their first SARS-CoV-2 antibody test recorded in the database. Patients with more than 1 antibody test on the index date where results were discordant were excluded.

Main Outcomes/MeasuresPrimary endpoints were index antibody test results and post-index diagnostic NAAT results, with infection defined as a positive diagnostic test post-index, as measured in 30-day intervals (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, >90 days). Additional measures included demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics at the time of the index antibody test, such as recorded signs and symptoms or prior evidence of COVID-19 (diagnoses or NAAT+) and recorded comorbidities.

ResultsWe included 3,257,478 unique patients with an index antibody test. Of these, 2,876,773 (88.3%) had a negative index antibody result, 378,606 (11.6%) had a positive index antibody result, and 2,099 (0.1%) had an inconclusive index antibody result. Patients with a negative antibody test were somewhat older at index than those with a positive result (mean of 48 versus 44 years). A fraction (18.4%) of individuals who were initially seropositive converted to seronegative over the follow up period. During the follow-up periods, the ratio (CI) of positive NAAT results among individuals who had a positive antibody test at index versus those with a negative antibody test at index was 2.85 (2.73 - 2.97) at 0-30 days, 0.67 (0.6 - 0.74) at 31-60 days, 0.29 (0.24 - 0.35) at 61-90 days), and 0.10 (0.05 - 0.19) at >90 days.

ConclusionsPatients who display positive antibody tests are initially more likely to have a positive NAAT, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but over time become markedly less likely to have a positive NAAT. This result suggests seropositivity using commercially available assays is associated with protection from infection. The duration of protection is unknown and may wane over time; this parameter will need to be addressed in a study with extended duration of follow up.

247,Public adherence to governmental recommendations regarding quarantine and testing for COVID-19 in two Norwegian cohorts,"BackgroundCombatting the COVID-19 pandemic relies at present on non-pharmacological interventions. Governments are using various approaches from general advice to full lockdown. There is a need to describe and understand adherence to public health actions.

MethodsParticipants from two ongoing cohorts, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and The Norwegian Influenza Pregnancy Cohort (NorFlu), answered questionnaires every 14 days since March 2020. From the summer of 2020, testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 became easily available. Recommendations were that respiratory symptoms should lead to testing, and that confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be followed by quarantine. We estimated the adherence to these guidelines in responses from cohort participants in the period August to October 2020.

ResultsLess than 40% of men who were ill and less than 45% of women who were ill, tested themselves for SARS-CoV-2 during the same 14-day periods. Among subjects tested for COVID-19, about 53% of men and 59% of women reported quarantine. For subjects with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, the proportions quarantined were 65% for men and 72% for women.

ConclusionsPublic adherence to governmental recommendations regarding testing and quarantine were lower than expected in a country with high trust in government.

248,An expedited approach towards the rationale design of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors with in vitro antiviral activity,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. In this study, we report an expedited drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR) reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. The most potent compound 23R had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376. Our designs were guided by overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R), a non-covalent inhibitor derived from Ug-4CR, with the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + calpain inhibitor XII/GC376/UAWJ247. Binding site analysis suggests a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementary with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Lead optimization led to the discovery of 23R, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC50 of 0.31 M and EC50 of 1.27 M, respectively. The binding and specificity of 23R to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were confirmed in a thermal shift assay and native mass spectrometry assay. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed the P2 biphenyl fits snuggly into the S2 pocket and the benzyl group in the -methylbenzyl faces towards the core of the enzyme, occupying a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study revealed the most potent non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors reported to date and a novel binding pocket that can be explored for Mpro inhibitor design.",Naoya Kitamura; Michael Dominic Sacco; Chunlong Ma; Yanmei Hu; Julia Townsend; Xiangzhi Meng; Fushun Zhang; Xiujun Zhang; Adis Kukuljac; Michael Marty; David Schultz; Sara Cherry; Yan Xiang; Yu Chen; Jun Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423537,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423537,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,False
249,"Mental health among pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, a mixed methods approach using data from the Mom2B mobile application for research","Public health emergencies such as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have significant impact on mental health, and have been shown to impact on already prevalent affective disorders during and after pregnancy. The aim of this study was to utilize modern tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as wellbeing and life changes in pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, where no lockdown has been in place.

Data from the Mom2B, a national ongoing mobile application-based study of pregnant and newly-delivered women were utilized. Participants (n= 1345) filled out self-report screeners of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Questions about COVID symptoms and effects on life and health care were added from March 2020. Movement data was collected using the phones GPS sensor. Mood scores were compared with throughout the months of 2020 and to the levels of a previous collected material. Highest levels of depression and anxiety were evident in April and October 2020. Symptoms were higher among those feeling socially isolated, but not for those infected or with symptomatic family members. Wellbeing and mobility were strongly positively correlated and were lowest in April. Women reported on cancelled healthcare appointments and worry about their partners being absent from the delivery.

The Mom2B application enabled gathering information at a national level in real-time as the pandemic has been evolving. Levels of perinatal affective symptoms and low wellbeing were elevated compared with previous years as well as with months with fewer cases of SARS-Cov-2. Similar applications can help healthcare providers and governmental bodies to in real time monitor high-risk groups during crises, as well as to adjust measures and the support offered.

250,Face covering adherence is positively associated with better mental health and wellbeing: a longitudinal analysis of the CovidLife surveys,"Face masks or coverings are effective at reducing airborne infection rates, yet pandemic mitigation measures, including wearing face coverings, have been suggested to contribute to reductions in quality of life and poorer mental health. Longitudinal analyses of more than 11,000 participants across the UK found no association between lower adherence to face covering guidelines and poorer mental health. The opposite appears to be true. Even after controlling for behavioral, social, and psychological confounds, including measures of pre-pandemic mental health, individuals who wore face coverings ""most of the time"" or ""always"" had better mental health and wellbeing than those who did not. These results suggest that wearing face coverings more often will not negatively impact mental health.",Drew M Altschul; Chloe Fawns-Ritchie; Alex Kwong; Louise Hartley; Clifford Nangle; Rachel Edwards; Rebecca Dawson; Christie Levein; Archie Campbell; Robin Flaig; Andrew McIntosh; Ian Deary; Riccardo Marioni; Caroline Hayward; Cathie Sudlow; Elaine Douglas; David Bell; David Porteous,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248477,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248477,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
251,The polybasic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike modulates viral sensitivity to Type I IFN and IFITM2,"The cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses types 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) requires sequential protease processing of the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the S precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons, and more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2 and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH- and cathepsin-dependent in late endosomes where, like SARS-CoV-1 S, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we find that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs.

IMPORTANCEThe furin cleavage site in the S protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2, and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423592,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423592,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,False
252,Sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters conferred by a novel recombinant subunit vaccine,"A safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential to avert the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed a subunit vaccine, which is comprised of CHO-expressed spike ectodomain protein (StriFK) and nitrogen bisphosphonates-modified zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH002C). This vaccine candidate rapidly elicited the robust humoral response, Th1/Th2 balanced helper CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell immune response in animal models. In mice, hamsters, and non-human primates, 2-shot and 3-shot immunization of StriFK-FH002C generated 28- to 38-fold and 47- to 269-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than the human COVID-19 convalescent plasmas, respectively. More importantly, the StriFK-FH002C immunization conferred sterilizing immunity to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which also protected animals from virus-induced weight loss, COVID-19-like symptoms, and pneumonia in hamsters. Vaccine-induced neutralizing and cell-based receptor-blocking antibody titers correlated well with protective efficacy in hamsters, suggesting vaccine-elicited protection is immune-associated. The StriFK-FH002C provided a promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate for further clinical evaluation.",yangtao wu; Xiaofen Huang; Lunzhi Yuan; Shaojuan Wang; Yali Zhang; Hualong Xiong; Rirong Chen; Jian Ma; Ruoyao Qi; Meifeng Nie; Jingjing Xu; Zhigang Zhang; Liqiang Chen; Min Wei; Ming Zhou; Minping Cai; Yang Shi; Liang Zhang; Huan Yu; Junping Hong; Zikang Wang; Yunda Hong; Mingxi Yue; Zonglin Li; Dabing Chen; Qingbing Zheng; Shaowei Li; Yixin Chen; Tong Cheng; Jun Zhang; Tianying Zhang; Huacheng Zhu; Qinjian Zhao; Quan Yuan; Yi Guan; NingShao Xia,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423552,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423552,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,False
253,A comprehensive transcriptome analysis reveals broader but weaker host response of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV,"COVID-19, which has resulted a worldwide health crisis with more than 74.9 million confirmed cases worldwide by December 2020, is caused by a newly emerging coronavirus identified and named SARS-CoV-2 in February in Wuhan, China. Experiences in defeating SARS, which infested during 2002-2003, can be used in treating the new disease. However, comparative genomics and epidemiology studies have shown much difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which underlies the different clinical features and therapies in between those two diseases. Further studies comparing transcriptomes infected by these two viruses to uncover the differences in host responses would be necessary. Here we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infected human cell lines, including Caco-2, Calu-3, H1299. Clustering analysis and expression of ACE2 show that SARS-CoV-2 has broader but weaker infection, where the largest discrepancy occurs in the epithelial lung cancer cell, Calu-3. SARS-CoV-2 genes also show less tissue specificity than SARS-CoV genes. Furthermore, we detected more general but moderate immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected transcriptomes by comparing weighted gene co-expression networks and modules. Our results suggest a different immune therapy and treatment scheme for COVID-19 patients than the ones used on SARS patients.

254,The impact of the first UK Covid-19 lockdown on carers and people living with low prevalence dementia: results from the Rare Dementia Support survey,"IntroductionThe public health measures imposed to contain Covid-19 during the first UK lockdown resulted in significant changes in the provision of community support and care for people with dementia. People with low prevalence and young-onset dementias often experience non-memory, behavioural or neuropsychiatric symptoms that require specialised support.

ObjectiveWe explored the impact of the first Covid-19 lockdown on people living with low prevalence and young-onset dementia and their carers in the UK.

MethodAn online survey, including eleven questions about the impact of the lockdown on both the person with dementia and their family caregivers was conducted. Participants were people living with dementia and caregivers who are members of the UK national-reach organisation Rare Dementia Support.

Results184 carers and 24 people with dementia completed the survey. People with dementia experienced worsening of cognitive symptoms (70%), ability to do things (62%) and well-being (57%) according to their carers. Carers also reported a reduction in the support received for caring (55%). 93% of carers of people living in care homes reported a reduction in their ability to provide care. 26% of carers reported changes in the medication of the person with dementia during the lockdown. 74% of people with dementia reported decreased ability to connect with people socially.

ConclusionsPeople with dementia experienced a worsening of dementia symptoms, removal of support and increased difficulty to connect with other people socially during the 1st wave of Covid-19. Carers encountered barriers to both receiving and providing support and a decline in their own mental health and well-being.

Key pointsO_LI70 % of carers reported cognitive symptoms getting worse during the lockdown (e.g., the person with dementia being more disoriented and finding it more difficult to communicate).
C_LIO_LI26 % of carers reported a change (initiation or increase) in medication in the person with dementia during the lockdown.
C_LIO_LI79 % carers reported their own physical or mental health getting worse due to the lockdown. This increased to 93% when considering responses only from family carers of people living in care homes.
C_LIO_LI93 % of family carers of people living in care homes found it harder to continue providing care and support for their relative due to Covid-19.

However, beyond their protective function, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may also participate in disease pathogenesis. To explore the potential relationship between virus-specific humoral responses and COVID-19 immunopathology, we measured serum antibody classes and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleoprotein in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We found that RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG3 dominated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, were more abundant in severe patients, and positively correlated with several clinical parameters of inflammation. In contrast, a virus-specific IgA2 response skewed toward RBD rather than NP associated with a more favorable clinical course.

In this paper, we have evaluated the effects of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Results have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known effects of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein) and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids).

261,Common variants at 21q22.3 locus influence MX1 gene expression and susceptibility to severe COVID-19,"The COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-Cov-2, presents a heterogeneous clinical spectrum. The risk factors do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, so it is possible that genetic factors could account for novel insights into its pathogenesis.

In our previous study, we hypothesized that common variants on chromosome 21, near TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes, may be genetic risk factors associated to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show suggestive associations (P[&le;]1x10-5) with severe COVID-19.

262,"Epidemiological feature, viral shedding, and antibody seroconversion among asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic/ presymptomatic COVID-19 patients","Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pandemic. However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. We enrolled 193 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 31 were asymptomatic carriers, 149 were symptomatic patients, and 14 were presymptomatic patients. Compared to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower levels of C-reactive protein and viral load, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (P=0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (P=0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic than presymptomatic patients. Viral shedding was longer in presymptomatic patients than in asymptomatic carriers. Conclusively, asymptomatic carriers have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than do symptomatic patients and this antiviral immunity is not contributable to humoral immunity.",Yi Chen; Ping Li; Yibo Ding; Miao Liu; Leijie Liu; Bo Yi; Ting Wu; Hongjun Dong; Xuying Lao; Keqing Ding; Haibo Wang; Dongliang Zhang; Xiaojie Tan; Zhongfa Wang; Guozhang Xu; Guangwen Cao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248447,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
263,Furin cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein at S1/S2 and S2'for viral fusion/entry: indirect role for TMPRSS2,"The Spike (S)-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds host-cell receptor ACE2 and requires proteolytic ""priming"" (S1/S2) and ""fusion-activation"" (S2) for viral entry. The S-protein furin-like motifs PRRAR685{downarrow} and KPSKR815{downarrow} indicated that proprotein convertases promote virus entry. We demonstrate that furin and PC5A induce cleavage at both sites, ACE2 enhances S2 processing, and their pharmacological inhibition (BOS-inhibitors) block endogenous cleavages. S1/S2-mutations (S1/S2) limit S-protein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, similarly to BOS-inhibitors. Unexpectedly, TMPRSS2 does not cleave at S1/S2 or S2, but it can: (i) cleave/inactivate S-protein into S2a/S2b; (ii) shed ACE2; (iii) cleave S1-subunit into secreted S1, activities inhibited by Camostat. In lung-derived Calu-3 cells, BOS-inhibitors and {micro}S1/S2 severely curtail ""pH-independent"" viral entry, and BOS-inhibitors alone/with Camostat potently reduce infectious viral titer and cytopathic effects. Overall, our results show that: furin plays a critical role in generating fusion-competent S-protein, and indirectly, TMPRSS2 promotes viral entry, supporting furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors as potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.",Rachid Essalmani; Jaspreet Jain; Delia Susan-Resiga; Ursula Andreo; Alexandra Evagelidis; Rabeb Mouna Derbali; David Huynh; Frederic Dallaire; Melanie Laporte; Adrien Delpal; Priscila Sutto-Ortiz; Bruno Coutard; Claudine Mapa; Keith Wilcoxen; Etienne Decroly; Tram Pham; Eric A.

264,Identification of NPC1 as a novel SARS-CoV-2 intracellular target,"Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) receptor is an endosomal membrane protein that regulates intracellular cholesterol trafficking, which is crucial in the Ebola virus (EBOV) cycle. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the cell by binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the ACE2 receptor. This requires S-protein processing either by the surface transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion or cathepsin L for endosomal entry. Additional host factors are required for viral fusion at endosomes. Here, we report a novel interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) with the cholesterol transporter NPC1. Moreover, small molecules interfering with NPC1 that inhibit EBOV entry, also inhibited human coronavirus.

265,SARS-CoV-2 protein ORF3a is pathogenic in Drosophila and causes phenotypes associated with COVID-19 post-viral syndrome,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused millions of deaths and will continue to exact incalculable tolls worldwide. While great strides have been made toward understanding and combating the mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, relatively little is known about the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins that contribute to pathogenicity during infection and that cause neurological sequela after viral clearance. We used Drosophila to develop an in vivo model that characterizes mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and found ORF3a adversely affects longevity and motor function by inducing apoptosis and inflammation in the nervous system. Chloroquine alleviated ORF3a induced phenotypes in the CNS, arguing our Drosophila model is amenable to high throughput drug screening. Our work provides novel insights into the pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system that can be used to develop new treatment strategies for post-viral syndrome.

Here, we identified non-synonymous mutations in MHC-I restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes after deep sequencing of 747 SARS-CoV- 2 virus isolates. Mutant peptides exhibited diminished or abrogated MHC-I binding, which was associated with a loss of recognition and functional responses by CD8+ T cells isolated from HLA-matched COVID-19 patients.

267,Fast and scalable lipid nanoparticle formulation of niclosamide (nano NCM) effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro,"As exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, highly infective respiratory viruses can spread rapidly in the population because of lack of effective approaches to control viral replication and spread. Niclosamide (NCM) is an old anthelminthic drug (World Health Organization essential medicine list) with pleiotropic pharmacological activities. Several recent publications demonstrated that NCM has broad antiviral activities and potently inhibits viral replication, including replication of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and dengue viruses. Unfortunately, NCM is almost completely insoluble in water, which limits its clinical use. We developed a highly scalable and cost-effective nanoparticle formulation of NCM (nano NCM) using only FDA-approved excipient and demonstrated potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells (Vero E6 and ACE2-expressing lung epithelium cells).

270,Genetic Conservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Replication Complex in Globally Circulating Isolates from Humans and Minks Predicts Minimal Pre-Existing Resistance to Remdesivir,"Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, > 90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates and >300 from mink isolates collected through early September 2020 were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in [&ge;]0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates.

In addition, among the sequence variants observed in [&ge;]0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition.

271,Oxygen saturation instability in suspected covid-19 patients; contrasting effects of reduced VA/Q and shunt.,"Patients in the UK at risk of Covid-19 pneumonia, but not needing immediate hospital attention, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify at home deterioration in oxygen saturation (SaO2 or SpO2). A recent finding in Covid-19 pneumonia is a dominant reduction in VA/Q. A mathematical model of gas exchange was used to examine the effect of reduction of VA/Q or increase in shunt on SaO2 stability inferred from the slope of the PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersects the line representing ambient PIO2. Reduced VA/Q predicted SpO2 instability breathing air, e.g. a {+/-}1 kPa change in PIO2 gave an 8% change in SpO2 at a VA/Q of 0.4 but a 1.5% change in SpO2 with a 15% shunt. As a consistency check, two patients with pre-existing lung disease and 12 hour continuous SpO2 monitoring breathing air had gas exchange impairment analysed in terms of shunt and reduced VA/Q. The patient with 16% shunt and normal VA/Q had a stable but reduced SpO2 (circa 93%) throughout the 12 hr period. The patient with a VA/Q reduced to 0.48 had SpO2 ranging from 75-95% during the same period. SpO2 monitoring in suspected covid-19 patients should focus on SpO2 varying >5% in 30 minutes. Such instability in at risk patients is not diagnostic of Covid -19 pneumonia but this may be suspected from a dominant reduction in VA/Q if episodic hypoxaemia has progressed from a stable SpO2.",John Gareth Jones; John Gareth Jones,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248126,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248126,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True

273,Risk Factors for SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity in a Health Care Worker Population,"BackgroundProtecting health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is essential. Serologic testing can identify HCWs who had minimally symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that were missed by occupational screening based on daily symptom and temperature checks. Recent studies report conflicting results regarding the impact of occupational factors on SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity amongst HCWs.

MethodsThe study population included all hospital workers at an academic medical center in Orange County, California. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed from a fingerstick blood specimen using a coronavirus antigen microarray, which compares IgM and IgG antibodies against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens with positive and negative controls to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with 98% specificity and 93% sensitivity. Demographic, occupational, and clinical factors were surveyed and their effect on seropositivity estimated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

ResultsAmongst 1,557 HCWs with complete data, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 10.8%. Risk factors for increased seropositivity included male gender, exposure to COVID-19 outside of work, working in food or environmental services, and working in COVID-19 units. Amongst the 1,103 HCW who were seropositive but missed by occupational screening, additional risk factors included younger age and working in administration.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is significantly higher than reported case counts even amongst HCWs who are meticulously screened. Seropositive HCWs missed by occupational screening were more likely to be younger, work roles without direct patient care, or have COVID-19 exposure outside of work.

We investigate immunological changes in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate their potential relationships with persistent symptoms, termed long COVID.

We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise tolerance were assessed and investigated their relationship with convalescent results.

We demonstrate persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance were common but were not associated with immunological changes.

275,Negative vaccine attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 in relation to smoking status: a population survey of UK adults,"IntroductionWe examined differences in negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 specifically, by smoking status in a large sample of adults in the UK.

MethodData were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions.

ResultsRelative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsCurrent smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities.

ImplicationsThese results suggest that without intervention, smokers will be less likely than non-smokers to take up the offer of a Covid-19 vaccine when offered. Targeted policy action may be required to ensure low uptake of Covid-19 vaccination programmes does not compound health inequalities between smokers and non-smokers.",Sarah E Jackson; Elise E Paul; Jamie Brown; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248396,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248396,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
276,Enhancing the estimation of compartmental model parameters for COVID-19 data with a high level of uncertainty,"Research on predictions related to the spread of the novel coronavirus are crucial in decision-making to mitigate the disease. Computational simulations are often used as a basis for forecasting the dynamics of epidemics and, for this purpose, compartmental models have been widely used to assess the situation resulting from the spread of the disease in the population. Reliable data is essential to obtain adequate simulations. However, several political, economic, and social factors have caused inconsistencies in the reported data, which are reflected in the capacity for realistic simulations and predictions. Such uncertainties are mainly motivated by a large-scale underreporting of cases due to the reduced testing capacity in some locations. In order to mitigate the effects of noise in the data used to estimate parameters of compartmental models, we propose strategies capable of improving the ability to predict the spread of the disease. We show that the regularization of data by means of Gaussian Process Regression can reduce the variability of successive forecasts, thus improving predictive ability. We also present the advantages of adopting parameters of compartmental models that vary over time, in detriment to the usual approach with constant values.",Gustavo B Libotte; Lucas Anjos; Regina C Almeida; Sandra M C Malta; Renato S Silva,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248389,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248389,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True

The evaluation of such a global pandemic requires matching reports that follow different procedures and even overcoming some countries censorship that restricts publications.

MethodsThis work proposes a methodology that could assist future studies. Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) is proposed as the proper approach as Covid-19 cases data is compositional in nature. Under this methodology, for each country three attributes were selected: cumulative number of deaths (D); cumulative number of recovered patients(R); present number of patients (A).

ResultsAfter the operation called closure, with c=1, a ternary diagram and Log-Ratio plots, as well as, compositional statistics are presented. Cluster analysis is then applied, splitting the countries into discrete groups.

278,Blood group A Secretors are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 cardiovascular disease complications,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, an infection capable of causing severe disease and death but which may also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic in many individuals. While several risk factors, including age, have been described, the mechanisms of this variation are poorly understood. Several studies have described associations between blood group and COVID-19 severity, while others do not. Expression of ABO glycans on secreted proteins and non-erythroid cells is controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2). Inactivating mutations result in a non-secretor phenotype which is known to protect against some viral infections. We investigated whether ABO or secretor status was associated with COVID-19 severity. Data combined from healthcare records and laboratory tests (n=275) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients hospitalised with COVID-19, confirmed higher than expected numbers of blood group A individuals compared to O (RR=1.24, CI 95% [1.05,1.47], P=0.0111). There was also a significant association between group A and COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications (RR=2.56, CI 95% [1.43,4.55], P=0.0011) which is independent of gender. Molecular analysis of phenotype revealed that group A patients who are non-secretors are significantly less likely to be hospitalised than secretors. In a larger cohort of 1000 convalescent plasma donors, among whom the majority displayed COVID-19 symptoms and only a small minority required hospitalisation, group A non-secretors were slightly over-represented. Our findings indicate that group A non-secretors are not resistant to infection by SARS-CoV-2, but they are likely to experience a less severe form of its associated disease.

279,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk perception, behaviour, and preventive measures at schools in Berlin, Germany, during the early post-lockdown phase: A cross-sectional study","BackgroundBriefly before the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Berlin, Germany, schools closed in mid-March 2020 for six weeks. Following re-opening, schools gradually resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks preceding the summer holidays.

AimDuring this phase, we conducted a situational assessment in schools among students and teachers as to infection status, symptoms, affective, behavioural, educational issues, and preventive measures.

MethodsAt twenty-four randomly selected primary and secondary schools, one class each was examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household and schooling characteristics, leisure time activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and facemask wearing were assessed.

ResultsAmong 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was SARS-CoV-2 infected (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%); 16% reported symptoms upon examination, and 48% in the preceding 14 days. Compared to before the pandemic, the proportion of leisure time spent as screen-time increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity. Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, but acceptance of adapted health behaviours was high. Governmental preventive measures were adequately implemented, with primary schools performing better than secondary schools.

ConclusionIn this phase of rare infection and low seroreactivity, individual and school-level infection prevention and control measures were largely adhered to. Nevertheless, vigilance, continued and proactive preventive measures, and well-rehearsed reaction options are essential to cope with increasing pandemic activity.",Franziska Hommes; Welmoed van Loon; Marlene Thielecke; Igor Abramovich; Sascha Lieber; Ralf Hammerich; Sabine Gehrke-Beck; Elisabeth Linzbach; Angela Schuster; Katja von dem Busche; Stefanie Theuring; Maximilian Gertler; Gabriela Equihua Martinez; Joachim Richter; Clara Bergmann; Alisa Bölke; Falko Böhringer; Marcus A.

280,CRISPR-cas13 enzymology rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 fragments in a clinical setting,"The well-recognized genome editing ability of the CRISPR-Cas system has triggered significant advances in CRISPR diagnostics. This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options in some cases. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence based assay that received EUA authorization from the FDA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 27.6-45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting. These findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in high demand; often with limited resources. This approach highlights new thinking in infectious disease identification and can be expanded to measure nucleic acids in other clinical isolates.",Wahab A. Khan; Rachael E.

281,Detection of SARS-CoV2 antigen in human saliva may be a reliable tool for large scale screening,"IntroductionSARS-CoV2, the aetiological agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, has been detected in saliva and recently implicated in several oral diseases. Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) requires medical / technical expertise. A reliable and easy to handle point-of-care (POC) test is highly desirable, especially to curb transmission. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated a commercially available POC rapid antigen test (RAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV2 antigens in the saliva of RT-PCR confirmed positive and negative patients.

MethodsThirty saliva samples of 10 saliva RT-PCR negative and 20 saliva RT-PCR positive patients were tested by RAT.

ResultsRAT was negative in 10/10 (100%) RT-PCR-negative samples; positive in 9/20 (45%) RT-PCR-positive samples; concordance was 63% (p=0.001). Patients with positive RAT had higher virus copies in their NPS samples compared to the RAT-negative patients. This difference was also statistically significant (p=0.01).

ConclusionThus, the POC RAT may be used to detect SARS-CoV2 as a reliable tool for self-testing, large-scale population screening and emergency medical/dental screening. Patients negative by RAT should be confirmed by RT-PCR.",Priya Kannian; Chandra Lavanya; Krittika Ravichandran; Bagavad Gita Jayaraman; Pasuvaraj Mahanathi; Veeraraghavan Ashwini; Nagalingeswaran Kumarasamy; Gunaseelan Rajan; Kannan Ranganathan; Stephen J Challacombe; Jennifer Webster-Cyriaque; Newell W Johnson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248437,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248437,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
282,Current evidence for COVID-19 therapies: a systematic literature review,"Effective therapeutic interventions for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 are urgently needed. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019 and 14 October 2020. Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively.

In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderate-to-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term; and some included low patient numbers.

This review highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 to increase the quality of available evidence.

284,Excess deaths among Latino people in California during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundLatinos in the US are experiencing higher excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic than any other racial/ethnic group, but it is unclear which subgroups within this diverse population are most affected. Such information is necessary to target policies and programs that prevent further excess mortality and reduce inequities.

MethodsUsing death certificate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latinos in California from March 1 through October 3, 2020. We quantified excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups defined by age, sex, place of birth, education, occupation, and combinations of these factors.

ResultsDuring the first seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded expected deaths by 10,304, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or Central America (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.63), with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in manufacturing (RR 1.62; 95% PI, 1.52, 1.72) or food-and-agriculture occupations (RR 1.50; 95% PI, 1.40, 1.61). Disparities in excess death by place of birth and education were magnified among Latinos in essential occupations.

ConclusionsForeign-birth, low formal education, and work in an essential sector put some Latinos in California at higher risk of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should reduce the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Latino immigrants and Latinos in unsafe working conditions; these may include early vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care.",Alicia R.

From the study subjects (N = 258) retrospectively enrolled when confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive, nasopharyngeal (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), and sputum specimens were restored for retesting SARS-CoV-2 and detecting respiratory pathogens. Majority of the study subjects (95.7%, N = 247) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS/OPS specimens, suggesting that the upper respiratory specimen is most valuable in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Coinfection rates in COVID-19 patients (N = 258) with respiratory pathogens were 9.7% (N = 25); 8.5% (N = 22) respiratory viruses and 1.2% (N = 3) Mycoplasma pneumoniae, an atypical bacterium. Of the respiratory virus coinfection cases (N = 22), 20 (90.9%) were co-infected with a single respiratory virus and 2 (0.8%) (metapneumovirus/adenovirus and rhinovirus/bocavirus 1/2/3/4) with two viruses. Respiratory viruses in single viral coinfection cases with SARS-CoV-2 were as follows: non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43, N = 5, 1.9%), rhinovirus (N = 4, 1.6%), metapneumovirus (N = 3, 1.2%), influenza A (N = 3, 1.2%), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (N = 3, 1.2%), and adenovirus (N = 2, 0.8%). No mixed coinfections with respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae were found.

MethodsData were collated by the hospital epidemiological service for patients admitted from 3/7/2020-9/1/2020. Time until final discharge or death was the outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate time until death among admitted patients.

FindingsIn total, 99.06% of cases had resolved leading to 1,179 discharges and 211 deaths. Length of stay was significantly longer in those who died as compared to those who did not p=0.007). Of patients who had been discharged (n=1,179), 54 were readmitted and 9 subsequently died. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that in addition to older age, male sex, and heart failure, a history of premorbid depression was a risk factor for COVI-19 mortality.

InterpretationWhile an increasing number of studies have shown effects linking cardiovascular risk factors with increased risk of mortality in COVID+ patients, this study reports that history of depression is a risk factor for COVID mortality.

287,Risk of thrombotic complications in influenza versus COVID-19 hospitalized patients,"BackgroundWhereas accumulating studies on COVID-19 patients report high incidences of thrombotic complications, large studies on clinically relevant thrombosis in patients with other respiratory tract infections are lacking. How this high risk in COVID-19 patients compares to those observed in hospitalized patients with other viral pneumonias such as influenza is unknown.

ObjectivesTo assess the incidence of venous and arterial thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients as opposed to that observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study; we used data from Statistics Netherlands (study period: 2018) on thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients. In parallel, we assessed the cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications - adjusted for competing risk of death - in patients with COVID-19 in three Dutch hospitals (February 24th - April 26th 2020).

ResultsOf the 13.217 hospitalized influenza patients, 437 (3.3%) were diagnosed with thrombotic complications, versus 66 (11%) of the 579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The 30-day cumulative incidence of any thrombotic complication in influenza was 11% (95%CI 9.4-12) versus 25% (95%CI 18-32) in COVID-19. For venous thrombotic complications (VTE) and arterial thrombotic complications alone, these numbers were respectively 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.6) and 7.5% (95%CI 6.3-8.8) in influenza versus 23% (95%CI 16-29) and 4.4% (95%CI 1.9-8.8) in COVID-19.

ConclusionsThe incidence of thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients was lower than in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This difference was mainly driven by a high risk of VTE complications in the COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. Remarkably, influenza patients were more often diagnosed with arterial thrombotic complications.

288,The COSEVAST Study: Unravelling the role of Arterial Stiffness in COVID-19 Disease severity.,"BackgroundBased on the detailed review of available research and case studies reported in reputed international journals, it can be concluded that endothelial damage (En-dotheliitis) both in small and large arteries may be an important factor of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Arterial stiffness due to Endothelial Dysfunction has been established as an independent and specific marker of various chronic cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveOur objective was to examine functional impairment of the arteries in COVID-19 disease and establish the non-invasive measurement of Arterial Stiffness as an independent marker of disease severity.

MethodsWe recorded the Arterial Stiffness of 23 Mild, 21 Moderate and 20 Severe COVID-19 patients grouped on latest NIH severity criteria. We observed Arterial Stiffness of COVID-19 patients with standard parameters like non-invasive Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave velocity (cfPWV), Age-Normalized increase in cfPWV (ANI_cfPWV).

ResultsModerate and Severe COVID-19 patients have extremely elevated arterial stiffness than Mild patients. In Mild patients, cfPWV (829.1 {+/-} 139.2 cm/s) was extremely significantly lower than both Moderate (1067 {+/-} 152.5 cm/s, P< 0.0001) and Severe (1416 {+/-} 253.9 cm/s, P < 0.0001) patients.

289,Lessons learned from Vietnam's COVID-19 response: the role of adaptive behavior change and testing in epidemic control,"BackgroundVietnam has emerged as one of the worlds leading success stories in responding to COVID-19. After prolonged zero-low transmission, a summer outbreak of unknown source at Da Nang caused the countrys first COVID-19 deaths, but was quickly suppressed. Vietnam recently reopened its borders to international travelers. Understanding the attendant risks and how to minimize them is crucial as Vietnam moves into this new phase.

MethodsWe create an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Vietnam, using regional testing data and a detailed linelist of the 1,014 COVID-19 cases, including 35 deaths, identified across Vietnam. We investigate the Da Nang outbreak, and quantify the risk of another outbreak under different assumptions about behavioral/policy responses and ongoing testing.

ResultsThe Da Nang outbreak, although rapidly contained once detected, nevertheless caused significant community transmission before it was detected; higher symptomatic testing could have mitigated this. If testing levels do not increase, the adoption of past policies in response to newly-detected cases may reduce the size of potential outbreaks but will not prevent them. Compared to a baseline symptomatic testing rate of 10%, we estimate half as many infections under a 20% testing rate, and a quarter as many with 40-50% testing rates, over the four months following border reopenings.

ConclusionsVietnams success in controlling COVID-19 is largely attributable to its rapid response to detected outbreaks, but the speed of response could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing.",Quang D Pham; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Thuong V Nguyen; Quang C Luong; Dai Q Tran; Thai Q Pham; Lan T Phan; Tan Q Dang; Duong N Tran; Hung T Do; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Romesh G Abeysuriya; Assaf P Oron; Cliff C Kerr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248454,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
290,Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution suggest a possible role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 titers,"BackgroundRecent in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pathogen and one clinical study reported fluoxetine exposure at a median dose of 20mg in patients with the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a significantly lower risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct in silico population dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (EC90) of SARS-Cov-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells.

MethodsPopulation pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for a structural one-compartment model with first-order absorption was used to simulate fluoxetine concentration-time data. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine doses (20mg/day, 40mg/day, and 60mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough level for the EC90 SARS-Cov-2 inhibitory concentration at each day throughout a 10-day treatment period. All analyses were conducted via statistical programming in R.

ResultsStandard fluoxetine antidepressant doses resulted in a range of 79% to 97% of the patient population achieving a trough target plasma concentration of 25.1 ng/ml which translates to lung-tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher (EC90 of 4.02 M). At a dose of 40mg per day, at least 85% of patients will reach the trough target EC90 concentration within 3-days.

292,Household bubbles and COVID-19 transmission: insights from percolation theory,"BackgroundIn the era of social distancing to curb the spread of COVID-19, bubbling is the combining of two or more households to create an exclusive larger group. The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved.

MethodsWe developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number.

ResultsWe find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household has a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household.

ConclusionsBubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission, however under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.",Leon Danon; Lucas Lacasa; Ellen Brooks-Pollock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248311,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248311,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True

294,"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, risk factors for infection and associated symptoms in Geneva, Switzerland: a population-based study","BackgroundPopulation-based serological surveys provide a means for assessing the immunologic landscape of a community, without the biases related to health-seeking behaviors and testing practices typically associated with rt-PCR testing. This study assesses SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over the first epidemic wave in Canton Geneva, Switzerland, as well as biological and socio-economic risk factors for infection and symptoms associated with IgG seropositivity.

Methods and findingsBetween April 6 and June 30, 2020, former participants of a yearly representative cross-sectional survey of the 20-75-year-old population of the canton of Geneva were invited to participate in a seroprevalence study, along with household members five years and older. We collected blood and tested it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG). Questionnaires were self-administered. We estimated seroprevalence with a Bayesian model accounting for test performance and sampling design. We included 8344 participants (53.5% women, mean age 46.9 years). The population-level seroprevalence over the 12-week study period was 7.8 % (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9), accounting for sex, age and household random effects. Seroprevalence was highest among 18-49 year olds (9.5%, 95%CrI 8.1-10.9), with young children (5-9 years) and those >65 years having significantly lower seroprevalence (4.3% and 4.7-5.4% respectively). Men were more likely to be seropositive than women (relative risk 1.2, 95%CrI 1.1-1.4). Odds of seropositivity were reduced for female retirees (0.46, 95%CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (0.35, 95%CI 0.13-1.0) compared to employed individuals, and for current smokers (0.36, 95%CI 0.23-0.55) compared to never-smokers. We found no significant association between occupation, level of education, neighborhood income and the risk of being seropositive. Symptoms most strongly associated with seropositivity were anosmia/dysgeusia, loss of appetite, fever, fatigue and myalgia and/or arthralgia. Thirteen percent of seropositive participants reported no symptoms.

ConclusionsOur results confirm a low population seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first wave in Geneva, a region hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors were not associated with seropositivity in this sample. The elderly and young children were less frequently seropositive, though it is not clear how biology and behaviors shape these differences.

295,No evidence of association between schools and SARS-CoV-2 second wave in Italy.,"During Covid-19 pandemic, school closure has been mandated in analogy to its known effect against influenza, but it is unclear whether schools are early amplifiers of Covid19 cases. By analyzing the case scenario of school reopening across the twenty-one Italian regions, we did not find evidence that schools drove the second SARS-CoV-2 wave. Indeed, from September 12 to November 7 2020, SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students was lower than that in the general population of all but two Italian regions. From August 28 to October 25 in Veneto where school reopened on September 14, the growth of SARS-CoV-2 incidence measured across all age groups was lower in school age individuals, maximal in 20-29 and 45-49 years old individuals. Moreover, the increase in Covid19 reproduction number Rt was not associated with the different school opening dates. Reciprocally, school closures in two regions where they were implemented before other measures did not affect the rate of Rt decline. In schools, despite the high frequency of tests per week, secondary infections were <1%, and clusters in a representative November week infrequent. Thus, our prospective analysis does not support a role for school reopening as a driver of the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Italy.",Sara Gandini; Maurizio Rainisio; Maria Luisa Iannuzzo; Federica Bellerba; Francesco Cecconi; Luca Scorrano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248134,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248134,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
296,International Comparisons of Harmonized Laboratory Value Trajectories to Predict Severe COVID-19: Leveraging the 4CE Collaborative Across 342 Hospitals and 6 Countries: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"ObjectivesTo perform an international comparison of the trajectory of laboratory values among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who develop severe disease and identify optimal timing of laboratory value collection to predict severity across hospitals and regions.

DesignRetrospective cohort study.

SettingThe Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE), an international multi-site data-sharing collaborative of 342 hospitals in the US and in Europe.

ParticipantsPatients hospitalized with COVID-19, admitted before or after PCR-confirmed result for SARS-CoV-2.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresPatients were categorized as ""ever-severe"" or ""never-severe"" using the validated 4CE severity criteria. Eighteen laboratory tests associated with poor COVID-19-related outcomes were evaluated for predictive accuracy by area under the curve (AUC), compared between the severity categories. Subgroup analysis was performed to validate a subset of laboratory values as predictive of severity against a published algorithm. A subset of laboratory values (CRP, albumin, LDH, neutrophil count, D-dimer, and procalcitonin) was compared between North American and European sites for severity prediction.

ResultsOf 36,447 patients with COVID-19, 19,953 (43.7%) were categorized as ever-severe. Most patients (78.7%) were 50 years of age or older and male (60.5%). Longitudinal trajectories of CRP, albumin, LDH, neutrophil count, D-dimer, and procalcitonin showed association with disease severity. Significant differences of laboratory values at admission were found between the two groups. With the exception of D-dimer, predictive discrimination of laboratory values did not improve after admission. Sub-group analysis using age, D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count as predictive of severity at admission showed similar discrimination to a published algorithm (AUC=0.88 and 0.91, respectively). Both models deteriorated in predictive accuracy as the disease progressed. On average, no difference in severity prediction was found between North American and European sites.

ConclusionsLaboratory test values at admission can be used to predict severity in patients with COVID-19. There is a need for prediction models that will perform well over the course of the disease in hospitalized patients.",Griffin M Weber; Chuan Hong; Nathan P Palmer; Paul Avillach; Shawn N Murphy; Alba Gutiérrez-Sacristán; Zongqi Xia; Arnaud Serret-Larmande; Antoine Neuraz; Gilbert S.

297,A recombinant fragment of Human surfactant protein D binds Spike protein and inhibits infectivity and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples,"RationaleCOVID-19 is an acute infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human surfactant protein D (SP-D) is known to interact with spike protein of SARS-CoV, but its immune-surveillance against SARS-CoV-2 is not known.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the potential of a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) as an inhibitor of replication and infection of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsrfhSP-D interaction with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE-2 receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between spike protein and ACE-2 by rfhSP-D was confirmed using direct and indirect ELISA. The effect of rfhSP-D on replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples was studied by measuring the expression of RdRp gene of the virus using qPCR.

Measurements and Main ResultsIn-silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the RBD of spike of SARS-CoV-2 were commonly involved in interacting with rfhSP-D and ACE-2. Studies using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (asymptomatic, n=7 and symptomatic, n=8 and negative controls n=15) demonstrated that treatment with 5M rfhSP-D inhibited viral replication by ~5.5 fold and was more efficient than Remdesivir (100 M). Approximately, a 2-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 5M rfhSP-D.

ConclusionsThese results conclusively demonstrate that the calcium independent rfhSP-D mediated inhibition of binding between the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE-2, its host cell receptor, and a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in-vitro.",Taruna Madan; Barnali Biswas; Praveen Varghese; Rambhadur Subedi; Hrishikesh Pandit; Susan Idicula-Thomas; Indra Kundu; Sheetalnath Babasaheb Rooge; Reshu Aggarwal; Dinesh Tripathi; Savneet Kaur; Ekta Gupta; Sanjeev Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423415,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423415,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False
298,A new concept on anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: strong CD8+ T-cell immune response in both spleen and lung induced in mice by endogenously engineered extracellular vesicles,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 is spreading rapidly in the absence of validated tools to control the growing epidemic besides social distancing and masks. Many efforts are ongoing for the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since there is an imminent need to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread. Essentially all vaccines in most advanced phases are based on the induction of antibody response against either whole or part of spike (S) protein. Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We exploited this technology with the aim to identify a clinical candidate defined as DNA vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens inducing a robust CD8+ T-cell response. This is a new vaccination approach employing a DNA expression vector encoding a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) showing an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells are internalized by antigen-presenting cells leading to cross-presentation of the associated antigens thereby priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we recovered DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and four viral antigens, namely N- and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. All fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity was generated. Most important, high levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells were found in bronchoalveolar lavages of immunized mice. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lung. EVs engineered with SARS-CoV-2 antigens proved immunogenic also in the human system through cross-priming assays carried out with ex vivo human cells. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed as anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.",Flavia Ferrantelli; Chiara Chiozzini; Francesco Manfredi; Patrizia Leone; Maurizio Federico,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423420,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423420,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False
299,Human Surfactant Protein D Binds S1 and Receptor Binding Domain of Spike protein and acts as an entry inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudotyped viral particles in vitro,"Human SP-D is a potent innate immune molecule whose presence at pulmonary mucosal surfaces allows immune surveillance role against pulmonary pathogens. Higher levels of serum SP-D have been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV). Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo models. In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection. rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain. Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2. The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following rfhSP-D treatment (10 g/ml). The results highlight the therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection and merits pre-clinical studies in murine models.",Miao-Hsi Hsieh; Nazar Beirag; Valarmathy Murugaiah; Yu-Chi Chou; Wen-Shuo Kuo; Hui-Fan Kao; Taruna Madan; Uday Kishore; Jiu-Yao Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423418,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423418,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False
300,An infectivity-enhancing site on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is targeted by COVID-19 patient antibodies,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe symptoms in a subset of patients, suggesting the presence of certain unknown risk factors. Although antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been shown prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) dramatically enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2, and thus increased SARS-CoV2 infectivity. Surprisingly, mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the surface of the NTD. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected in all samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study. However, the ratio of infectivity-enhancing antibodies to neutralizing antibodies differed among patients. Furthermore, the antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site were detected in 3 out of 48 uninfected donors, albeit at low levels. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development, especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies.",Yafei Liu; Wai Tuck Soh; Asa Tada; Akemi Arakawa; Sumiko Matsuoka; Emi E Nakayama; Songling Li; Chikako Ono; Shiho Torii; Kazuki Kishida; Hui Jin; Wataru Nakai; Noriko Arase; Atsushi Nakagawa; Yasuhiro Shindo; Masako Kohyama; Hironori Nakagami; Keisuke Tomii; Koichiro Ohmura; Shiro Ohshima; Masato Okada; Yoshiharu Matsuura; Daron M Standley; Tatsuo Shioda; Hisashi Arase,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423358,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423358,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False

We show that a RNAemia occurs more frequently and lasts longer in patients that develop critical disease compared to patients that develop moderate or severe disease. Furthermore we show that concentrations of IL-10 and MCP-1--but not IL-6--are associated with viral load in serum.

303,assayM: a web application to monitor mutations in COVID-19 diagnostic assays.,"SummaryReverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard as diagnostic assays for the detection of COVID-19 and the specificity and sensitivity of these assays depend on the complementarity of the RT-PCR primers to the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

304,Multi-omic profiling reveals widespread dysregulation of innate immunity and hematopoiesis in COVID-19,"Our understanding of protective vs. pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is limited by inadequate profiling of patients at the extremes of the disease severity spectrum. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity, from outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses reveal widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal COVID-19, with the most profound disturbances including a prominent neutrophil hyperactivation signature and monocytes with anti-inflammatory features. We further demonstrate that emergency myelopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19.

305,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with and activates TLR4,"The onset of sepsis is an important feature of COVID19 and a main cause of death. It is unknown how SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral sepsis in human. We recently found that SARS-CoV-2 provoked an anti-bacterial like response and activation of TLR4 pathway at the very early stage of infection in animal models. This abnormal immune response led to emergency granulopoiesis and sepsis. However, the original trigger of TLR4 signaling by SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. We here identified that the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 could bind to TLR4 directly and robustly activate downstream signaling in monocytes and neutrophils. Moreover, specific TLR4 or NFKB inhibitor, or knockout of MyD88 could significantly block IL-1B induction by spike protein. We thus reveal that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a potent stimulus causing TLR4 activation and sepsis related abnormal responses.",Yingchi Zhao; Ming Kuang; Xiangxi Wang; Fuping You,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423427,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423427,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False
306,A human coronavirus evolves antigenically to escape antibody immunity,"There is intense interest in antibody immunity to coronaviruses. However, it is unknown if coronaviruses evolve to escape such immunity, and if so, how rapidly. Here we address this question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous 229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that neutralizing titers are lower against these ""future"" viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8-17 years later. The decreased neutralization of ""future"" viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain.

308,Fundamental Limitations of Contact Tracing for COVID-19,"Contact tracing has played a central role in COVID-19 control in many jurisdictions and is often used in conjunction with other measures such as travel restrictions and social distancing mandates. Contact tracing is made ineffective, however, by delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if delays are minimized, contact tracing can only prevent a fraction of onward transmissions from contacts. Without other measures in place, contact tracing alone is insufficient to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases. Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional bursts in call loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of control. We propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 control that broadly test individuals without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible - either with fast cheap tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with screening of judiciously chosen groups of high-risk individuals. Only by ramping up testing of asymptomatic individuals can we avoid the inherent delays that limit the efficacy of contact tracing.",Paul F Tupper; Sarah Otto; Caroline Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248299,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248299,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
309,"Modelling of COVID-19 vaccination strategies and herd immunity, in scenarios of limited and full vaccine supply in NSW, Australia.","Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is likely to be limited, and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile of 1 million doses in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control.

311,SARS-CoV-2 shifting transmission dynamics and hidden reservoirs limited the efficacy of public health interventions in Italy,"We investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Italy, one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, using phylodynamic analysis of viral genetic and epidemiological data. We observed the co-circulation of at least 13 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time, which were linked to multiple importations and characterized by large transmission clusters concomitant with a high number of infections. Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as ""hidden reservoirs"" during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave.

312,SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with higher nasopharyngeal viral load is strongly associated with severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19,"ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum and its association with the clinical severity of COVID-19.

MethodsAn analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single tertiary care hospital and included consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables, including required oxygen supplementation, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality, were examined.

ResultsFifty-six patients were included in the study. The median age was 54.5 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those without detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (78 vs. 50 years; P = .0013). RNAemia was detected in 19.6% of patients (11/56) and in 1.0% (1/25), 50.0% (6/12), and 100.0% (4/4) of moderate, severe, and critically ill cases, respectively. Patients with RNAemia required more frequent oxygen supplementation (90.0% vs. 13.3%; P < .0001) and ICU admission (81.8% vs. 6.7%; P < .0001) and required invasive mechanical ventilation (27.3% vs. 0.0%; P < .0001). Among patients with RNAemia, the median viral loads of NP swabs that were collected around the same time as the serum were significantly higher in critically ill cases (5.4 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 4.2-6.3]) than in moderate-severe cases (2.6 Log10 copies/L [1.1-4.5]; P =.030) and were significantly higher in nonsurvivor cases (6.2 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 6.0-6.5]) than in survivor cases (3.9 Log10 copies/L [1.6-4.6]; P =.045).

ConclusionsThis study demonstrated a relatively high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity. Moreover, among the patients with RNAemia, the viral loads of NP swabs were correlated with severity and mortality, thus suggesting the potential utility of combining serum testing with NP tests as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19 with a higher quality than each separate test.",Hitoshi Kawasuji; Yoshitomo Morinaga; Hideki Tani; Yoshihiro Yoshida; Yusuke Takegoshi; Makito Kaneda; Yushi Murai; Kou Kimoto; Akitoshi Ueno; Yuki Miyajima; Koyomi Kawago; Yasutaka Fukui; Miyuki Kimura; Hiroshi Yamada; Ippei Sakamaki; Yoshihiro Yamamoto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248388,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248388,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
313,"Association of working shifts, inside and outside of healthcare, with risk of severe COVID-19: An observational study","BackgroundHealth and key workers are at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; it is not known, however, if this risk is exacerbated in those with irregular work patterns. We aimed to investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers.

MethodsWe included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category), health worker only, shift worker only, or both and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions.

FindingsOf 235,685 participants (81{middle dot}5% neither health nor shift worker, 1{middle dot}4% health worker only, 16{middle dot}9% shift worker only, and 0{middle dot}3% both), there were 580 (0{middle dot}25%) cases of severe COVID-19. The risk of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2.32 [95% CI: 1{middle dot}33, 4{middle dot}05]; shift workers (2{middle dot}06 [1{middle dot}72, 2{middle dot}47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7{middle dot}56 [3{middle dot}86, 14{middle dot}79]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the risk severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals.

InterpretationBoth health and shift work were independently associated with over twice the risk of severe COVID-19; the risk was over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts. Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health and key worker status but also shift worker status.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe risk of developing severe COVID-19 is greater in occupational groups with higher levels of viral exposure, e.g. health and key workers. We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to December 8, 2020 for papers on shift work patterns, health work and incidence of COVID-19 using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""shift work"" ""health worker"". Recent evidence suggests shift workers are also at increased risk of severe COVID-19 but it is not clear if the risk is exacerbated in those who work shifts in healthcare.

Added value of this studyThis study uses data from UK Biobank, a prospective cohort of >500,000 adults aged 40-69 years with baseline assessments between March 2006 and July 2010. Participants occupation was categorised according to whether or not they were health workers and/or shift workers at baseline. Results showed that being a health worker, or working shifts, were similarly and independently associated with over twice the population level risk of severe COVID-19 independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and co-morbidities. The risk was seven times higher in health workers with shift working patterns. The impact of health and shift work tended to be higher in males and in minority ethnic groups, who are already at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. In people over the age of retirement, the risk of developing severe COVID-19 associated with baseline health worker status was no longer apparent, suggesting the risk is likely explained by exposure to the virus. However, the elevated risk associated with baseline shift worker status persisted, albeit attenuated.

Implications of all the available evidenceShift workers are at elevated risk of developing severe COVID-19. The persistence of an elevated risk in people who are now over retirement age, but had a shift worker status at baseline, suggests the risk may not be fully explained by increased exposure to the virus. Vaccination, therapeutic and prevention programmes are being prioritised for health care workers. Our data suggests that shift workers should also be prioritised for these preventive measures.",Alex Rowlands; Clare Gillies; Yogini Chudasama; Melanie Davies; Nazrul Islam; David Kloecker; Claire Lawson; Manish Pareek; Cameron Razieh; Francesco Zaccardi; Thomas Yates; Kamlesh Khunti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248243,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248243,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
314,PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 as a high risk factor for suicide - Key to prevention,"BackgroundRising rates of suicide, the most dreadful consequence of mental health effects elicited by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) are cause for grave concern. However, the exact association between mental health problems and suicide remains largely unknown in relation to COVID-19.

MethodsTo determine the impact of COVID-19 on suicide trajectory, we used an interrupted time-series design to analyze monthly suicides rates extracted from Japans national database. We next used mixed-effects regression models to investigate the relationship between the nationwide suicide increase in August 2020 and psychiatric states of 4,348 individuals from an online survey performed immediately before (December 2019) and during (August 2020) the pandemic. Psychiatric states included depression, anxiety, and COVID-19-related PTSD, a form of severe event-related stress.

FindingsIn Japan, suicides had gradually decreased before COVID-19 ({beta} = -0{middle dot}7x10-3, t57 = -14{middle dot}2, p = 8{middle dot}6x10-46), but increased drastically after a state of emergency was declared in April 2020 ({beta} = 0{middle dot}9x10-2, t57 = 17{middle dot}3, p = 2{middle dot}3x10-67). We found that PTSD symptoms reliably predict COVID-19s impact on suicide rates ({beta} = 6{middle dot}3x10-4, t3936 = 5{middle dot}96, p = 2{middle dot}7x10-9). In contrast, depression scores are a reliable indicator of stress vulnerability (i.e. future suicide increases, {beta} = 0{middle dot}001, t3936 = 6{middle dot}6, p = 4{middle dot}5x10-11). Simulations revealed that a one-point reduction in PTSD score could decrease suicides by up to 3{middle dot}1 per ten million people per month in Japan.

InterpretationPTSD symptoms may help to identify high-risk groups so as to increase efficacy of prevention policies.

315,Sub-national forecasts of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across the UK: a large-scale cross-sectional spatial modelling study,"IntroductionThere is evidence of decreasing uptake of routine immunisations in the UK in recent years. As the United Kingdom begins a mass vaccination campaign with a novel COVID-19 vaccine, it is unclear whether refusal of the vaccine in some regions and among some socio-economic groups will pose challenges for achieving herd/community immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThis study estimates uptake of a COVID-19 at unprecedented spatial resolution across the UK using a large-scale survey and state-of-the-art Bayesian statistical methods for estimating public opinion. Between 24 September and 14 October 2020, 17,684 individuals are surveyed in a cross-sectional online survey design. Regions and socio-economic groups who may be more resistant towards a new vaccine are identified using multilevel regression and poststratification. Gibbs sampling is used for Bayesian model inference, with uncertainty in parameter estimates captured via 95% highest posterior density intervals.

FindingsThis study predicts that clusters of non-vaccinators will likely emerge in many regions across the UK, most notably in London (which has 13 of the 20 lowest ranking regions) and the North West (which has four, including Greater Manchester and Liverpool). Males are much more likely to state intent to accept the vaccine than females (OR 1{middle dot}59, 1{middle dot}47 to 1{middle dot}73); while Muslims are less likely than atheists / agnostics (0{middle dot}75, 0{middle dot}57 to 0{middle dot}96), Black / Black British are less likely than Whites (0{middle dot}47, 0{middle dot}38 to 0{middle dot}60), and Polish speakers (0{middle dot}45, 0{middle dot}31 to 0{middle dot}63) are less likely than those who primarily speak English or Welsh. Across the UK, 8{middle dot}7% (8{middle dot}2 to 9{middle dot}2%) state that they would ""definitely not"" accept a vaccine, but less than half (47{middle dot}5%, 46{middle dot}5 to 48{middle dot}5%) say they would ""definitely"" accept a COVID-19 vaccine, with a substantial proportion unsure.

InterpretationThe study findings are extremely important in the context of achieving herd/community immunity. Low predicted acceptance rates in parts of London and the North West are of particular concern as many of these regions have among the highest rates of COVID-19 infection across the UK: low vaccine uptake in these regions may result in disease ""hotspots"" that amplify the spread of the disease and require increases in vaccination levels in adjacent regions to provide nationwide herd/community immunity. It is therefore extremely important to identify such regions, and to engage with communities within them in advance of vaccination rollout to the population at large. Encouragingly, intent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine is higher among older age-groups, who are among the first to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

316,"SIREN protocol: Impact of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 on the subsequent incidence of COVID-19 in 100,000 healthcare workers: do antibody positive healthcare workers have less reinfection than antibody negative healthcare workers?","BackgroundThe overall risk of reinfection in individuals who have previously had COVID-19 is unknown. To determine if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by at least one positive commercial antibody test performed in a laboratory) in healthcare workers confers future immunity to reinfection, we are undertaking a large-scale prospective longitudinal cohort study of healthcare staff across the United Kingdom.

MethodsPopulation and Setting: staff members of healthcare organisations working in hospitals in the UK

At recruitment, participants will have their serum tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and using these results will be initially allocated to either antibody positive or antibody negative cohorts. Participants will undergo antibody and viral RNA testing at 1-4 weekly intervals throughout the study period, and based on these results may move between cohorts. Any results from testing undertaken for other reasons (e.g. symptoms, contact tracing etc.) or prior to study entry will also be included. Individuals will complete enrolment and fortnightly questionnaires on exposures and symptoms. Follow-up will be for at least 12 months from study entry.

OutcomeThe primary outcome of interest is a reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 during the study period. Secondary outcomes will include incidence and prevalence (both RNA and antibody) of SARS-CoV-2, viral genomics, viral culture, symptom history and antibody/neutralising antibody titres.

ConclusionThis large study will help us to understand the impact of the presence of antibodies on the risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2; the results will have substantial implications in terms of national and international policy, as well as for risk management of contacts of COVID-19 cases.

In Japan, they provided similar services from November, 2020.

ObjectWe compared Google AI forecasting with a statistical model by human intelligence.

MethodWe regressed the number of patients whose onset date was day t on the number of patients whose past onset date was 14 days prior, with information about traditional surveillance data for common pediatric infectious diseases including influenza, and prescription surveillance 7 days prior. We predicted the number of onset patients for 7 days, prospectively. Finally, we compared the result with Googles AI-produced forecast. We used the discrepancy rate to evaluate the precision of prediction: the sum of absolute differences between data and prediction divided by the aggregate of data.

ResultsWe found Google prediction significantly negative correlated with the actual observed data, but our model slightly correlated but not significant. Moreover, discrepancy rate of Google prediction was 27.7% for the first week. The discrepancy rate of our model was only 3.47%.

320,"Internal medicine clerkship amidst COVID-19 pandemic: clinical learning experience of undergraduate medical students at Makerere University, Uganda: a cross-sectional study","BackgroundThe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to impose a significant impact on medical education. We aimed to describe the clinical learning experience of undergraduate medical students undertaking internal medicine clerkship during the COVID-19 pandemic at Makerere University, Uganda.

MethodsA descriptive, cross-sectional study among medical students in clinical years of study pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery undergraduate degree program was conducted in November 2020. Only 3rd (junior clerks) and 5th (senior clerks) year medical students whose internal medicine clerkships were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic were studied.

ResultsData of 188 (95%) eligible clinical year students; junior (101, 54.0%) and senior (86, 46.0%) were analysed. Median age was 24 (range: 22-42) years. Majority (70.1%) were male and Ugandan nationals (94.1%). Sixty-four (30.3%) students reported inadequate personal protective equipment, 152 (81.7%) felt at risk of contracting COVID-19, and 127 (67.9%) said it was difficult to observe COVID-19 standard operating procedures. Twenty-two students (11.9%) were discouraged from pursuing a career in internal medicine. Overall, most students reported good or excellent clinical experience pre-COVID-19 era compared to during the COVID-19 era (4.0 vs. 3.5, p<0.0001). Senior clerks significantly believed that the time allocated for the rotation was adequate (p<0.0001) and they were able to complete their study objectives (p<0.001), compared to the junior clerks. Senior clerks believed that learning was difficult when combined with junior clerks (p=0.013). About half of the students (51.4%, n=95) reported clinical teaching should remain as it was in the pre-COVID-19 era.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significantly negative effect on the clinical learning experience of the students.

321,Effect of COVID-19 on Critical ICU Capacity in US Acute Care Hospitals,"ImportanceThe current wave of COVID-19 infections has led to media reports of ICUs across the country reaching critical capacity. But the degree to which this has happened and community and institutional characteristics of hospitals where capacity limits have been reached is largely unknown.

ObjectiveTo determine changes in intensive care capacity in US acute care hospitals between September and early December, 2020 and to identify whether hospitals serving more vulnerable populations were more likely to exceed critical-levels of ICU occupancy.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective observational cohort of US acute care hospitals reporting to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from September 4, 2020 to December 3, 2020. Hospitals in this cohort were compared to all US acute care hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between community socioeconomic factors and hospital-structural features with a hospital reaching critical ICU capacity.

ExposureCommunity-level socioeconomic status and hospital-structural features

Main Outcomes and MeasuresOur primary outcome was reaching critical ICU capacity (>90%) for at least two weeks since September 4. Secondary outcomes included the weekly capacity and occupancy tabulated by state and by hospital referral region.

Results1,791 hospitals had unsuppressed ICU capacity data in the HHS Protect dataset, with 45% of hospitals reaching critical ICU capacity for at least two weeks during the study period. Hospitals in the South (OR = 2.79, p<0.001), Midwest (OR = 1.76, p=0.01) and West (OR = 1.85, p<0.01) were more likely to reach critical capacity than those in the Northeast. For-profit hospitals (OR = 2.15, p<0.001), rural hospitals (OR = 1.40, p<0.05) and hospitals in areas of high uninsurance (OR = 1.94, p<0.001) were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity, while hospitals with more intensivists (OR = 0.92, p=0.044 and higher nurse-bed ratios (OR = 0.95, p=0.013) were less likely to reach critical capacity.

Conclusions and RelevanceNearly half of U.S. hospitals reporting data to HHS Protect have reached critical capacity at some point since September. Those that are better resourced with staff were less likely to do so while for for-profit hospitals and those in poorer communities were more likely to reach capacity. Continued non-pharmacologic interventions are clearly needed to spread of the disease to ensure ICUs remain open for all patients needing critical care.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWith an increasing number of SARS-CoV2 infections, how has the burden on ICU capacity changed over the past three months and what community and institutional factors are associated with hospitals reaching critical capacity?

Finding45% of US acute care hospitals have reached critical ICU capacity at some point over the past three months. Hospital located in areas with fewer insured people were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity. At an institutional level, for-profit hospitals, rural hospitals, and those that have less baseline staffing of intensivists and nurses were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity.

ObjectiveTo characterize acute renal injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 and their relation with clinical outcomes within the framework of the SENTAD COVID clinical trial at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center.

MethodsAbu Dhabi Stem Cell Center (ADSCC) proposed a prospective clinical trial nebulization treatment with autologous stem cells (Non-Hematopoietic Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (NHPBSC)), at Abu Dhabi hospitals.

Participants20 treated patients were compared with 23 not treated patients. Both groups received COVID 19 standard treatment.

OutcomesAfter the results were collected, this study was created to determine the impact of the disease on the renal function and the efficacy of the therapy on patients outcomes.

ResultsOne third of the critical patients studied suffered kidney failure. Patients in the treated group showed a favorable tendency to improve in contrast to those in the control group. Less patients from group A suffered from sepsis in comparison with the group B (25% vs 65%), HR=0.38, (95% Confidence Interval: 0.16 - 0.86), *p=0.0212. These results suggested a NNT=2.5. An improvement in lymphocyte count, CRP, and shorter hospital stay after treatment was evidenced, which led to less superinfection and sepsis in the treated group.

ConclusionsThe proposed anti-inflammatory effect of the stem cells, offers a great promise for managing the illness, emerging as a crucial adjuvant tool in promoting healing and early recovery in severe COVID-19 infections and other supportive treatments.

323,Optimality in COVID-19 vaccination strategies determined by heterogeneity in human-human interaction networks,"Interactions between humans cause transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that heterogeneity in human-human interactions give rise to non-linear infection networks that gain complexity with time. Consequently, targeted vaccination strategies are challenged as such effects are not accurately captured by epidemiological models assuming homogeneous mixing. With vaccines being prepared for global deployment determining optimality for swiftly reaching population level immunity in heterogeneous local communities world-wide is critical. We introduce a model that predicts the effect of vaccination into an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak using precision simulation of human-human interaction and infection networks. We show that simulations incorporating non-linear network complexity and local heterogeneity can enable governance with performance-quantified vaccination strategies. Vaccinating highly interactive people diminishes the risk for an infection wave, while vaccinating the elderly reduces fatalities at low population level immunity. Interestingly, a combined strategy is not better due to non-linear effects. While risk groups should be vaccinated first to minimize fatalities, significant optimality branching is observed with increasing population level immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that regardless of immunization strategy non-pharmaceutical interventions are required to prevent ICU overload and breakdown of healthcare systems. The approach, adaptable in real-time and applicable to other viruses, provides a highly valuable platform for the current and future pandemics.",Bjoern Goldenbogen; Stephan Oliver Adler; Oliver Bodeit; Judith Wodke; Ximena Escalera-Fanjul; Aviv Korman; Maria Krantz; Lasse Bonn; Rafael Ubaldo Moran Torres; Johanna EL Haffner; Maxim Karnetzki; Ivo Maintz; Lisa Mallis; Hannah Prawitz; Patrick Steven Segelitz; Martin Seeger; Rune Linding; Edda Klipp,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248301,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248301,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
324,"Using Administrative Data to Incorporate Age and Sex-Dependent Resource Use for COVID-19 Acute Care Resource Use Simulations in Ontario, Canada","As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, more local data has become available, enabling a more granular modeling approach. In March 2020, we developed a COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) model to estimate the acute care resource use in Ontario, Canada. In this paper, we describe the evolution of CORE2.0 to incorporate age, sex, and time-dependent acute care resource use, length of stay, and mortality to simulate hospital occupancy. Demographics (e.g., age and sex) of infected cases are informed by 4-month averages between March-June, and July-October using 10-year age groups. The probability of hospitalization, ICU admission, and requiring mechanical ventilation are all age and sex-dependent. LOS for each acute care level ranges from 5.7 to 16.15 days in the ward, 6.5 to 10.7 days in the ICU without ventilation, and 14.8 to 21.6 days on the ventilator, depending on month of infection. We calibrated some LOS components to reported ward and ICU occupancy between June 15 and October 31, 2020. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of CORE2.0 for a regional analysis of Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada to simulate the ward bed, ICU bed, and ventilator occupancies for 30 days starting December 2020 for three case trajectory scenarios. Moving forward, this model has become highly flexible and customizable to data updates, and can better inform acute care planning and public measures as the pandemic progresses.",Stephen Mac; Raphael Ximenes; Kali Barrett; Yasin A Khan; Petros Pechlivanoglou; Juan David Rios; David MJ Naimark; Beate Sander,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248166,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248166,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
325,Understanding the net benefit of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19: An enhanced decision-curve analysis,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) offer the ability to diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and at low cost; however, lower sensitivity has limited adoption of Ag-RDT in clinical settings.

MethodsWe compared Ag-RDT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), and clinical judgment alone for diagnosing COVID-19 among symptomatic patients. We investigated two scenarios: a high-prevalence hospital setting with 24-hour NAAT turnaround, and a lower-prevalence outpatient setting with 3-day NAAT turnaround. We simulated transmission from cases and contacts and relationships between time, viral burden, transmission, and case detection. We used decision curve analysis to compare diagnostic approaches, estimating the time- and infectivity-dependent benefit of each true-positive diagnosis.

ResultsIn the primary analysis comparing Ag-RDT and NAAT, greater net benefit was achieved with Ag-RDT in the outpatient setting and with NAAT in the hospital setting. In the hospital setting, Ag-RDT becomes more beneficial if NAAT turnaround times exceed 2 days or Ag-RDT sensitivity increases to at least 95% (relative to NAAT) during acute illness. Similarly, in the outpatient setting, NAAT could be more beneficial when NAAT turnaround time remains under 2 days or patients strictly isolate while awaiting results. Clinical judgment was preferred only if clinical diagnoses generated a robust clinical and public health response and false-positive diagnoses produced minimal harm.

ConclusionsFor diagnosing symptomatic COVID-19, Ag-RDT may provide greater net benefit than either NAAT or clinical judgment when NAAT turnaround times are more than two days. NAAT is likely to remain optimal for hospitalized patients with prolonged symptoms prior to admission.",Emily A Kendall; Nimalan Arinaminpathy; Jilian A Sacks; Yukari C Manabe; Sabine Dittrich; Samuel G Schumacher; David W Dowdy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248357,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248357,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
326,Impaired ICOS signaling between Tfh and B cells distinguishes hospitalized from ambulatory CoViD-19 patients,"Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by systemic immune responses that appear to be dysregulated with more severe CoViD-19 disease. Lymphopenia and delayed antibody responses are commonly identified in CoViD-19 subjects, and recent reports have demonstrated abrogation of germinal centers in severe CoViD-19. This work assessed a potential mechanistic basis for impaired humoral responses, focusing on the T follicular helper (Tfh) and B cell interface that is critical for germinal center reactions. Here we demonstrated that Tfh activity is impaired in hospitalized relative to ambulatory CoViD-19 subjects, potentially due to decreased expression of the costimulatory molecule ICOS-L on B cells. Functional impairment manifested as a diminished ability to stimulated Tfh derived IFN{gamma} and IL-21, the latter of which is critical for B cell proliferation and differentiation. Activation of Tfh cells by agonism of the ICOS receptor ex vivo by an agonistic antibody stimulated the generation of IFN{gamma}/IL-21 double positive cells from hospitalized CoViD-19 subjects. This report establishes an immunological defect that differentiates ambulatory from hospitalized CoViD and suggests that agents that could restore impaired mechanisms at the Tfh-B cell interface may be of therapeutic value.",Amanda Hanson; Heather Cohen; Hao Wang; Nandini Shekhar; Chinmayee Shah; Abha Dhaneshwar; Bethany W Harvey; Richard Murray; Christopher J Harvey,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248343,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248343,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
327,Antibody responses to endemic coronaviruses modulate COVID-19 convalescent plasma functionality,"COVID-19 convalescent plasma, particularly plasma with high-titer SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibodies, has been successfully used for treatment of COVID-19. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-S titer but that suffer from low neutralizing activity.

Although many point-of-care antibody tests are available globally, they have been subjected to limited clinical validation. This has led to suboptimal outcomes in the field, where antibody tests play a significant role in tracking the immunity of individuals and communities. In this study an antibody test, ImmunoQuick that recognizes antibodies to the Nucleocapsid and Spike proteins of SARS CoV-2 was tested in 100 symptomatic patients with a positive or negative diagnosis of COVID-19, based on RT-PCR results. The overall sensitivity of the test was found to be 86.1% (95% CI: 76.4% to 92.8%) and specificity 100% (95% confidence interval: 73.5% to 100%).

329,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before and after symptom onset: impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as contact tracing and quarantine, are currently the primary means of controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, it remains uncertain which interventions are most effective at reducing transmission at the population level. Using serial interval data from before and after the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China, we estimate that the relative frequency of presymptomatic transmission increased from 34% before the rollout to 71% afterward. The shift touward earlier transmission indicates a disproportionate reduction in transmission post-symptom onset. We estimate that, following the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions, transmission post-symptom onset was reduced by 82% whereas presymptomatic transmission decreased by only 16%. These findings suggest that interventions which limit opportunities for transmission in the later stages of infection, such as contact tracing and isolation, may have been particularly effective at reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Mary Bushman; Colin J.

Data from both hemispheres and the second wave provide opportunities to further examine climatic drivers. With a statistical method designed to detect transitory associations, we show consistent negative effects of temperature and absolute humidity at large spatial scales. At finer spatial resolutions we substantiate these connections during the seasonal rise and fall of COVID-19. Strong disease responses are identified between 12-18{degrees}C for Temperature and 4-12 g/m3 for Absolute Humidity.

331,Large-Scale Measurement of Aggregate Human Colocation Patterns for Epidemiological Modeling,"To understand and model public health emergencies, epidemiologists need data that describes how humans are moving and interacting across physical space. Such data has traditionally been difficult for researchers to obtain with the temporal resolution and geographic breadth that is needed to study, for example, a global pandemic. This paper describes Colocation Maps, which are spatial network datasets that have been developed within Facebooks Data For Good program. These Maps estimate how often people from different regions are colocated: in particular, for a pair of geographic regions x and y, these Maps estimate the probability that a randomly chosen person from x and a randomly chosen person from y are simultaneously located in the same place during a randomly chosen minute in a given week. These datasets are well suited to parametrize metapopulation models of disease spread or to measure temporal changes in interactions between people from different regions; indeed, they have already been used for both of these purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we show how Colocation Maps differ from existing data sources, describe how the datasets are built, provide examples of their use in compartmental modeling, and summarize ideas for further development of these and related datasets. We also conduct the first large-scale analysis of human colocation patterns across the world. Among the findings of this study, we observe that a pair of regions can exhibit high colocation despite few people moving between them. We also find that although few pairs of people are colocated for many days over the course of a week, these pairs can contribute significant fractions of the total colocation time within a region or between pairs of regions.",Shankar Iyer; Brian Karrer; Daniel T.

332,Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to guide vaccination strategy in a city,"Transmission chains within cities provide an important contribution to case burden and economic impact during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and should be a major focus for preventive measures to achieve containment. Here, at very high spatio-temporal resolution, we analysed determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a medium-sized European city. We combined detailed epidemiological, mobility, and socioeconomic data-sets with whole genome sequencing during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave. Both phylogenetic clustering and compartmental modelling analysis were performed based on the dominating viral variant (B.1-C15324T; 60% of all cases). Here we show that transmissions on the city population level are driven by the socioeconomically weaker and highly mobile groups. Simulated vaccination scenarios showed that vaccination of a third of the population at 90% efficacy prioritising the latter groups would induce a stronger preventive effect compared to vaccinating exclusively senior population groups first. Our analysis accounts for both social interaction and mobility on the basis of molecularly related cases, thereby providing high confidence estimates of the underlying epidemic dynamics that may readily be translatable to other municipal areas.",Sarah C.

333,Extraction-free protocol combining Proteinase K and heat inactivation for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR,"Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold-standard technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal swabs specimens. The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT- qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples.

However, the exact mechanisms of thromboembolic events remain elusive. In this work, we show that immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass in patients with COVID-19 trigger the formation of procoagulant PLTs in a Fc-gamma-RIIA (Fc{gamma}RIIA) dependent pathway leading to increased thrombus formation in vitro. Most importantly, these events were significantly inhibited via Fc{gamma}RIIA blockade as well as by the elevation of PLTs intracellular cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) levels by the clinical used agent Iloprost. The novel findings of Fc{gamma}RIIA mediated prothrombotic conditions in terms of procoagulant PLTs leading to higher thrombus formation as well as the successful inhibition of these events via Iloprost could be promising for the future treatment of the complex coagulopathy observed in COVID-19 disease.

335,Accelerated intermittent theta burst as a substitute for patients needing electroconvulsive therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: study protocol for an open-label clinical trial,"BackgroundTreatment resistant depression (TRD) is one of the leading causes of disability in Canada and is associated with significant societal costs. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an approved, safe, and well-tolerated intervention for TRD. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the number of visits to the clinic is a potential approach to significantly minimize exposure and transmission risks to patients. This can be accomplished by administering multiple treatment sessions in a single day, using an rTMS protocol known as accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS). The objective of this novel study is to assess the feasibility, acceptance and clinical outcomes of a practical high-dose aiTBS protocol, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse prevention treatments, in patients with unipolar depression previously responsive to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or patients warranting ECT due to symptom severity.

MethodsAll patients with unipolar depression referred to the brain stimulation service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) who warrant ECT will be offered screening to assess for eligibility to enroll in this trial. This open label, single group trial consists of 3 phases. In the acute treatment phase, treatment will occur 8 times daily for 5 days a week, until symptom remission is achieved or a maximum of 10 days of treatment. In the tapering phase, treatments will be reduced to 2 treatment days per week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 treatment day per week for 2 weeks. Patients will then enter the symptom-based relapse prevention phase including virtual check-ins and a treatment schedule based on symptom level. Remission, response and change in scores on several clinical measures from baseline to the end of the acute, tapering and relapse prevention phases represent the clinical outcomes of interest.

DiscussionFindings from this novel clinical trial may provide support for the use of aiTBS, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse prevention treatments, as a safe and effective alternative intervention for patients needing ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.

336,Exploring patient experiences of video consultations during Covid-19 in an outpatient care setting using routine feedback data from 955 contacts,"ObjectivesVideo consultations (VCs) have been rapidly implemented in response to Covid-19. However, limited research has explored patient experiences of VCs in this context. This research therefore explored patient experiences of VCs during their early stages of implementation in response to Covid-19.

DesignSecondary data analysis of routine patient survey responses using descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis.

Setting and participants955 (22.6%) survey responses following a VC using Attend Anywhere in a rural, aging and outpatient care setting between June and July 2020.

ResultsMost (93.2%) respondents reported having  good (n=210, 22.0%), or  very good (n=680, 71.2%) experiences with VCs. Most respondents accessed their VC alone (n=806, 84.4%), except for those aged 71+ (n=23/58, 39.7%). Most participants reported feeling listened to and understood (n=904, 94.7%), felt their needs had been met (n=860, 90.1%) and were able to communicate everything they wanted (n=848, 88.8%). Satisfaction with communication was very strongly associated with satisfaction with the technical performance of the VC (p<0.001). Free text responses had three key themes: i) barriers to VC use including technological difficulties, quality of patient information and accessibility or suitability concerns; ii) potential benefits including reduced stress and anxiety, enhanced accessibility, cost and time savings; and iii) patient suggested improvements including trial calls, turning music off, facilitating photo uploads, expanding written character limit and supporting other internet browsers. Most (92.1%) participants were likely to choose a VC again in the future.

ConclusionsThe vast majority of respondents reported positive experiences of VCs. Identified benefits of enhanced accessibility, affordability, time, monetary and environmental savings are particularly interesting for future service delivery. Further research is needed, using rapid co-design techniques, to improve feedback methods, patient information and experience to support sustainability and to address accessibility and experience of patients excluded from this work, through lack of VC access.

337,The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on the Behavior of Italian Citizens and Particulate Matter 10 and 2.5 Emissions in Lombardy,"Italy was one of the first nations in the world to have been heavily affected by the first wave of COVID-19. To date, it is among the first countries for both total cases and deaths. Numerous containment measures were taken from February to December 2020 to mitigate the pandemic, including total lockdowns across the entire country. The purpose of this research is to evaluate how these restrictions influenced Italian citizens' consumption habits (like online shopping, smart working and distance learning) and particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5 concentrations in the Lombardy region. In particular, this survey is aimed at assessing the environmental sustainability of the behaviors adopted in response to the limitations of personal freedoms on a regional and national level and quantifying the effect of the latter on particulate concentrations in Lombardy, the region most damaged by both COVID-19 and air pollution. Many tools and online platforms have been used to collect data, such as Google Trends, web portals for sharing statistical and demographic information like the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and AdminStat Italia, and surveys conducted by the Department of Civil Protection, other scientific studies, and the main national newspapers. Technical data on particulate matter was collected from the website of the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment (ARPA). To highlight any significant change, the average daily concentrations of PM10 and 2.5 during 2020 in all the provinces of Lombardy were compared with those of the previous year. The comparison between the mean values was made through the t-test. Two values were considered as statistically confident when t < 1.9 . However, since the real significance of these thresholds is not easily determined, we kept some margins of suspicious confidence. Finally, we looked for possible causal correlations between changes in citizens' behavior and specific key events related to COVID-19. To do this, Pearson and Spearman correlations were used. The P-value threshold was indicatively set at 0.05. Microsoft Excel 2020 and Google Sheets software were used for data analysis. In conclusion, this paper showed a substantial ineffectiveness of total and partial lockdowns in reducing PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Lombardy. Furthermore, it estimates that COVID-19 has strongly changed the consumption habits of Italian citizens, forcing them to use home delivery services more actively which, at present, poses a potential additional threat to the environment. Among the positive aspects of this change there was the learning of the most modern technologies for distance teaching and smart working, a point from which to start for the construction of an energetically and environmentally sustainable policy.",Alessandro Rovetta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248285,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248285,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,True

Unemployment is associated with increased risk of CVD, and so there is concern that the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the CVD burden.

AimsThis modeling study aimed to quantify health loss, health cost burden and health inequities among people with CVD due to additional unemployment caused by COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruption in one high-income country: New Zealand (NZ).

MethodsWe adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD in the national NZ population. We modeled indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) for various scenarios of pandemic-related unemployment projections.

ResultsWe estimated the CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 HALYs (health-adjusted life years) for the different unemployment scenarios. Health inequities for M[a]ori (Indigenous population) were 3.7 times greater compared to non-M[a]ori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people).

Conclusions and policy implicationsUnemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant health loss and health inequities from CVD in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including job creation programs and measures directed towards CVD prevention.",Nhung Nghiem; Nick Wilson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248284,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248284,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,True
340,Covid Fast Fax: A system for real-time triage of Covid-19 case report faxes,"The scale and speed of the COVID-19 pandemic has strained many parts of the national healthcare infrastructure, including communicable disease monitoring and prevention. Many local health departments now receive hundreds or thousands of COVID-19 case reports a day. Many arrive via faxed handwritten forms, often intermingled with other faxes sent to a general fax line, making it difficult to rapidly identify the highest priority cases for outreach and monitoring. We present an AI-based system capable of real-time identification and triage of handwritten faxed COVID-19 forms. The system relies on two models: one model to identify which received pages correspond to case report forms, and a second model to extract information from the set of identified case reports. We evaluated the system on a set of 1,224 faxes received by a local health department over a two-week period. For the 88% of faxes of sufficient quality, the system detects COVID-19 reports with high precision, 0.98, and high recall, 0.91. Among all received COVID-19 faxes, the system identifies high priority cases with a specificity of 0.87, a precision of 0.46 and recall of 0.83. Our system can be adapted to new forms, after a brief training period. Covid Fast Fax can support local health departments in their efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and limit its impact on the community.

341,Exposure to Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors Is Associated with Reduced Mortality of Older Hypertensive Covid-19 Patients,"From a cohort of 1352 consecutive patients admitted with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, between February and April 2020, we selected and studied 688 patients with arterial hypertension (254 deaths) to assess whether use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) prior to hospital admission affects mortality from Covid-19. Prior use of RASIs was associated with a lower mortality in the over-68 group of patients, whereas no evidence of a similar effect (whether protective or adverse) was found in the younger group. There was positive relative excess due to a statistically significant (p =0.001) interaction between prior RASI exposure and an age greater than 68 years, corresponding to a positive relative excess risk. Next we used the subgroup of 411 hypertensive patients older than 68 yrs to separately assess the effects prior use of two RASI drug subclasses, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiogiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), by comparing these two exposures with no exposure to RASIs. We found both prior use of ACEIs and prior use of ARBs to be associated with a lower Covid-19 mortality, after adjusting for 32 medical history variables via propensity score matching.

342,Quantifying the importance and location of SARS-CoV-2 transmission events in large metropolitan areas,"Detailed characterizations of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk across different social settings can inform the design of targeted and less disruptive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), yet these data have been lacking. Here we integrate real-time, anonymous and privacy-enhanced geolocalized mobility data with census and demographic data in the New York City and Seattle metropolitan areas to build a detailed agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The aim is to estimate where, when, and how many transmission events happened in those urban areas during the first wave of the pandemic. We estimate that most infections (80%) are produced by a small number of people (27%), and that about 10% of events can be considered super-spreading events (SSEs), i.e. generating more than eight secondary infections. Although mass gatherings present an important risk for future SSEs, we find that the bulk of transmission in the first wave occurred in smaller events at settings like workplaces, grocery stores, or food venues. We also observe that places where the majority of transmission and SSEs happened changed during the pandemic and are different across cities, a signal of the large underlying behavioral component underneath them. Our results demonstrate that constant real-time tracking of transmission events is needed to create, evaluate, and refine more effective and localized measures to contain the pandemic.",Alberto Aleta; David Martin-Corral; Michiel Bakker; Ana Pastore y Piontti; Marco Ajelli; Maria Litvinova; Matteo Chinazzi; Natalie E Dean; M.

343,"Influence of clinical characteristics and anti-cancer therapy on outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 5,678 cancer patients","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic started a healthcare crisis and heavily impacted cancer services.

MethodsData from cohort studies of COVID-19 cancer patients published up until October 23rd 2020 from PubMed, PubMed Central, medRxiv and Google Scholar were reviewed. Meta-analyses using the random effects model was performed to assess the risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19.

ResultsOur meta-analyses including up to 5,678 patients from 13 studies showed that the following were all statistically significant risk factors for death following SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients: age of 65 and above, presence of co-morbidities, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and hypertension. There was no evidence that patients who had received cancer treatment within 60 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a higher risk of death, including patients who had recent chemotherapy.

ConclusionsCancer patients are susceptible to severe COVID-19, especially older patients and patients with co-morbidities who will require close monitoring. Our findings support the continued administration of anti-cancer therapy during the pandemic. The analysis of chemotherapy was powered at 70% to detect an effect size of 1.2 but all other anti-cancer treatments had lower power.

344,Physiological Effects of Exercising at Different Intensities Wearing TNT or Double-layer Cotton Facemasks Compared to Not Wearing a Mask,"We compared the physiological differences between exercising wearing a TNT or a double-layer-cotton (DLC) facemask (FM) and not wearing a mask (NM). Sixteen volunteers underwent 4 sets (S) of 2 sequential bouts (B). B1 and B2 corresponded to light and moderate intensity cycling, respectively. FMs were used as follows: S1: NM; S2: TNT or DLC; S3: DLC or TNT; and S4: NM. Metabolic, pulmonary, and perceptual variables were collected. The main results are expressed as effect sizes and confidence intervals (ES [95%CI]) for TNT and DLC unless otherwise indicated. Compared to NM, FM increased the duty cycle (B1=1.11[0.58-1.61] and 1.53[0.81-2.18]; B2=1.27[0.63-1.84] and 1.93[0.97-2.68]) and decreased breath frequency (B1=0.59[0.23-0.94] and 1.43[0.79-2.07], B2=0.39[0.05-0.71] and 1.33[0.71-1.94]). Only B1 tidal volume increased (0.33[0.09-0.56] and 0.62[0.18-1.05]) enough to avoid a ventilation reduction with TNT but not with DLC (B1=0.52[0.23-0.79]; B2=0.84[0.44-1.22]). Both FMs reduced oxygen saturation in B1 (0.56 [0.07-1.03] and 0.69 [0.09-1.28]) but only DLC did so in B2 (0.66 [0.11-1.13]). Both end tidal CO2 (B1=0.23[0.05-0.4] and 0.71[0.38-1.02]; B2=0.56[0.2-0.9] and 1.20[0.65-1.68]) and mixed-expired-CO2 (B1=0.74[0.38-1.08] 1.71[1.03-2.37], B2=0.94[0.45-1.38] and 1.78[0.97-2.42]) increased with FMs. Ventilatory adaptations imposed during FM exercising influenced blood-lung gas exchange.

345,Modelling conformational state dynamics and its role on infection for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein needs to be in an open-state conformation to interact with ACE2 and facilitate viral entry. We utilise coarse-grained normal-mode analyses to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on Glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and N501, including the N501Y mutation recently observed. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal-mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations thereon.

346,Suppression of miR-155 attenuates lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in human ACE2-transgenic mice,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent global pandemic. It is a deadly human viral disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a high rate of infection, morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop new therapies to control, treat and prevent this disease. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) of the viral host are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication, and building an antiviral cellular defense. Here, we have analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, we have analyzed the potency of anti-miR-155 therapy in a COVID-19 mouse model (mice transgenic for human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 receptor (tg-mice hACE2)). We report for the first time that miR-155 expression is elevated in COVID-19 patients. Further, our data indicate that the viral load as well as miR-155 levels are higher in male relative to female patients. Moreover, we find that the delivery of anti-miR-155 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 effectively suppresses miR-155 expression, and leads to improved survival and clinical scores. Importantly, anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice hACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2 not only exhibit reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also have increased anti-viral and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in the lungs. Thus, our study suggests anti-miR-155 as a novel therapy for mitigating the lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Dharmendra Kumar Soni; Juan Cabrera-Luque; Swagata Kar; Chaitali Sen; Joseph Devaney; Roopa Biswas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.423130,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.423130,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,False

ObjectiveTo estimate the extent to which the scientific workforce in different fields has been engaged publishing papers relative to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design, setting, and participantsWe evaluated Scopus (data cut, December 1, 2020) for all indexed published papers and preprints relevant to COVID-19. We mapped this COVID-19 literature in terms of its authors across 174 subfields of science according to the Science Metrix classification. We also evaluated the extent to which the most influential scientists across science (based on a composite citation indicator) had published COVID-19-related research. Finally, we assessed the features of authors who published the highest number of COVID-19 publications and of those with the highest impact in the COVID-19 field based on the composite citation indicator limited to COVID-19 publications.

Main outcomes and measuresPublishing scientists (authors) and their published papers and citation impact.

Results84,180 indexed publications were relevant to COVID-19 including 322,279 unique authors. The highest rates of COVID-19 publications were seen for authors classified in Public Health and in Clinical Medicine, where 11.3% (6,388/56,516) and 11.1% (92,570/833,060) of authors, respectively, had published on COVID-19. Almost all (173/174) subfields (except for Automobile Design & Engineering) had some authors publishing on COVID-19. Among active scientists at the top 2% of citation impact, 15,803 (13.3%) had published on COVID-19 in their publications in the first 11 months of 2020.

The rates were the highest in the fields of Clinical Medicine (27.7%) and Public Health (26.8%). In 83 of the 174 subfields of science, at least one in ten active, influential authors in that field had authored something on COVID-19. 65 authors had already at least 30 (and up to 133) COVID-19 publications each. Among the 300 authors with the highest composite citation indicator for COVID-19 publications, 26 were journalists or editors publishing news stories or editorials in prestigious journals; most common countries for the remaining were China (n=77), USA (n=66), UK (n=27), and Italy (n=20).

We leverage an increase in balcony birdwatching, a million eBird entries, and difference-in-difference techniques to test if avian species richness rose during Indias COVID lockdown. We find that birdwatchers in Indias 20 most populous cities observed 8-17% more species during the lockdown. Most additional observations occurred after a two-week lag, signaling greater abundance instead of improved detection. More frequent appearances of at-risk, rare, and common species were recorded, implying that making our cities more wildlife friendly can protect threatened species in addition to urban specialists.

350,Comparison of Healthcare costs and benefits of the UK's Covid-19 response with four European countries: Decision Modelling Study,"BackgroundIn responding to covid-19, governments have tried to balance protecting health while minimising Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses. We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective.

MethodsWe compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under ""mitigation"" to modelled events under ""no mitigation"" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at {pound}20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses.

FindingsThe UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, {pound}33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and {pound}1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at {pound}20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to {pound}1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total {pound}3075 GDP loss.

Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes.

InterpretationThe benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.

FundingElizabeth Blackwell Institute; UK MRC; UK NIHR.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOur research question was how the health-related net benefits and economic impacts of the UK response to the covid-19 epidemic first wave compared to other European countries. We searched PubMed, MedRxiv, and Arxiv for terms related to cost-effectivness, covid-19, and the UK.

Two studies compared predicted lives saved to predicted gross domestic product (GDP) losses. One found that lives saved by a lockdown would outweigh GDP losses, while another found a lockdown to cost {pound}10million per life saved. A later modelling study used quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), going beyond lives saved, and found cost per QALY was below {pound}50,000{middle dot} A fourth, comparing observed to modelled deaths and hospitalisations, found the cost per QALY was at least {pound}220,000, and thus the UK response was not cost-effective. None of these were international comparisons. One international study found good health and economic outcomes to be correlated. Another found global trade reductions and voluntary behavioural changes to have greater impact on economic growth than government measures. Neither considered cost-effectiveness. However, they suggest comparison to GDP loss is naive as this is total loss and not that due to government restrictions.

Added value of this studyWe compare the UK to Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden on health-related net benefits and economic impacts of government response from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. We describe countries response measures. We compared model predictions of outcomes under ""no mitigation"" to observed outcomes under ""mitigation"" up to July 20th 2020. We estimated healthcare costs, QALYs, and health-related net benefit (HRNB) saved. We compared HRBN to GDP losses using Sweden as a ""minimal mitigation"" comparator and calculated the % of total GDP loss they offset.

We found the UK saved 3{middle dot}17 (0{middle dot}32-3{middle dot}65) million QALYs, {pound}33 ({pound}8-38) billion in healthcare costs, and {pound}1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at the NHS threshold of {pound}20,000/QALY. This is comparable to the {pound}1,455 GDP loss per capita using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46{middle dot}1% (7{middle dot}1-53{middle dot}2) of the total estimated {pound}3075 GDP loss per capita. We found that Germany, Spain, and probably Sweden had greater HRNB per capita and offset greater percentages of GDP loss per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. We found countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility (e.g. older and more interpersonal contact) had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe add to growing evidence that the total economic impact of covid-19 exceeds the HRNB of the UKs response. However, using Sweden as comparator and comparing across countries, we argue that GDP loss is not purely due to government restrictions and that due to restrictions may be outweighed by HRNB. We evaluated the extent to which countries have offset GDP losses, and these appear to be higher in countries with more at-risk populations, higher testing, and higher mask wearing, rather than those with most stringent restrictions.",Howard Thom; Josephine Walker; Peter Vickerman; Will Hollingworth,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248201,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248201,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

352,Utility of COVID-19 Decision Rules Related to Consecutive Decline in Positivity or Hospitalizations: A Data-driven Simulation Study,"The White House issued Guidelines for Opening Up America Again to help state and local officials when reopening their economies. These included a ""downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period."" To examine this rule, we computed the probability of observing continuous decline in positivity when true positivity is in decline using data-driven simulation. Data for COVID-19 positivity reported in New York state from April 14 to May 5, 2020, where a clear reduction was observed, were used. First, a logistic regression model was fitted to the data, considering the fitted values as true positivity. Second, we created observed positivity by randomly selecting 25,000 people per day from a population with those true positivity for 14 days. The simulation was repeated 1,000 times to compute the probability of observing a consecutive decline. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the simulation with different daily numbers of tests (10 to 30,000) and length of observation (7 and 21 days). We further used daily hospitalizations as another metric, using data from the state of Indiana. With 25,000 daily tests, the probability of a consecutive decline in positivity for 14 days was 99.9% (95% CI: 99.7% to 100%). The probability dropped with smaller numbers of tests and longer lengths of consecutive observation, because there is more chance of observing an increase in positivity with smaller numbers of tests and longer observation. The probability of consecutive decline in hospitalizations was [~]0.0% regardless of the length of consecutive observation due to large variance. These results suggest that continuous declines in sample COVID-19 test positivity and hospitalizations may not be observed with sufficient probability, even when population probabilities truly decline. Criteria based on consecutive declines in metrics are unlikely to be useful for making decisions about relaxing COVID-19 mitigation efforts.",Keisuke Ejima; Kevin Maki; Lilian Golzarri-Arroyo; David B.

353,The association of covid-19 infection with household food insecurity among Iranian population,"ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the association of food insecurity score with the status of Covid-19 infection.

DesignAn online cross-sectional study. Demographic and socio-economic information were collected by questionnaire. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) was used in assessing household food security status. The analysis data was done by IBM SPSS 22.0, using Chi-square test, ANOVA test and Multinomial logistic regression model.

SettingIran

Participants2871 Iranian adults (over 18 years old)

Resultsfindings indicated that men [OR=0.60, CI= (0.41, 0.87), P<0.05], and healthcare personnel [OR=3.66, CI= (1.90, 7.05), P<0.001] were at higher risk for Covid-19. It was also shown that the food insecurity score is significantly higher among infected people compared to not-infected [OR=1.03, CI= (1.00, 1.05), P<0.05]. The comparison between suspected and not-infected individuals only indicated the significant differences in perceived COVID-19 prevention score, which was higher among not-infected people [OR=0.88, CI=(0.84,0.93), P<0.001].

ConclusionBased on the results, in addition to long-term policies to improve food security, policymakers and planners need to plan and implement short-term policies (financial or food assistance) to reduce society vulnerability to the Covid-19.",Naser Kalantari; Neda Ezzeddin; Hassan Eini-Zinab,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248221,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248221,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
354,"Anosmia and other SARS-CoV-2 positive test-associated symptoms, across three national, digital surveillance platforms as the COVID-19 pandemic and response unfolded: an observation study","BackgroundMultiple participatory surveillance platforms were developed across the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a real-time understanding of community-wide COVID-19 epidemiology. During this time, testing criteria broadened and healthcare policies matured. We sought to test whether there were consistent associations of symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 test status across three national surveillance platforms, during periods of testing and policy changes, and whether inconsistencies could better inform our understanding and future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.

MethodsFour months (1st April 2020 to 31st July 2020) of observation through three volunteer COVID-19 digital surveillance platforms targeting communities in three countries (Israel, United Kingdom, and United States). Logistic regression of self-reported symptom on self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test status (or test access), adjusted for age and sex, in each of the study cohorts. Odds ratios over time were compared to known changes in testing policies and fluctuations in COVID-19 incidence.

FindingsAnosmia/ageusia was the strongest, most consistent symptom associated with a positive COVID-19 test, based on 658,325 tests (5% positive) from over 10 million respondents in three digital surveillance platforms using longitudinal and cross-sectional survey methodologies. During higher-incidence periods with broader testing criteria, core COVID-19 symptoms were more strongly associated with test status. Lower incidence periods had, overall, larger confidence intervals.

InterpretationThe strong association of anosmia/ageusia with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity is omnipresent, supporting its validity as a reliable COVID-19 signal, regardless of the participatory surveillance platform or testing policy. This analysis highlights that precise effect estimates, as well as an understanding of test access patterns to interpret differences, are best done only when incidence is high. These findings strongly support the need for testing access to be as open as possible both for real-time epidemiologic investigation and public health utility.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, testing capacity expanded and governmental guidelines adapted, generally encouraging testing with a broader set of symptoms, not just fever with respiratory symptoms. In parallel, multiple large-scale citizen science digital surveillance platforms launched to complement knowledge from laboratory and somewhat smaller clinical studies. Symptoms such as loss of sense of smell have been identified as strongly predictive of COVID-19 infection in both clinical and syndromic surveillance analyses, and have therefore been used to inform these testing policy changes and access expansion.

Added value of this studyThis study identifies symptoms that are or are not consistently associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity over time and across three country-based COVID-19 surveillance platforms in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. These platforms are website and smartphone based, as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal. The study period of 4 months covers fluctuating COVID-19 prevalence during the fall of the first wave and, in some areas, rise of the second wave. In addition, the study period overlaps expansion of test access and test seeking. Importantly, these analyses track and highlight the value of individual symptoms to predict SARS-CoV-2 test positivity under a range of conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceDespite differences in surveillance methodology, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and disease prevalence, loss of sense of smell or taste was consistently the strongest predictor of COVID-19 infection across all platforms over time. As access to testing broadened, the relevance of COVID-like symptoms and consistency of their predictive ability became apparent. However, confidence bounds generally widened with a fall in COVID-19 incidence. Therefore, for the most robust symptom-based COVID-19 prediction models should consider surveillance data during periods of higher incidence and improved test access, and effect estimates that replicate across different epidemiologic conditions and platforms.",Carole Helene Sudre; Ayya Keshet; Mark S Graham; Amit D Joshi; Smadar Shilo; Hagai Rossman; Benjamin Murray; Erika Molteni; Kerstin Klaser; Liane S Canas; Michela Antonelli; Marc Modat; Joan Capdevila Pujol; Sajaysurya Ganesh; Jonathan Wolf; Tomer Meir; Andrew T Chan; Claire Steves; Timothy Spector; John S Brownstein; Eran Segal; Sebastien Ourselin; Christina Astley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248096,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248096,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

We report a nucleic acid test that integrates distinct mechanisms of DNA and RNA amplification optimized for high sensitivity and rapid kinetics, linked to Cas13 detection for specificity. We paired this workflow, termed Diagnostics with Coronavirus Enzymatic Reporting (DISCoVER), with extraction-free sample lysis using shelf-stable reagents that are widely available at low cost. DISCoVER has been validated on saliva samples to incentivize frequent testing for more widespread community surveillance and robustly detected attomolar levels of SARS-CoV-2 within 30 minutes, while avoiding false positives in virus-negative saliva.

356,The Presence of Ambulatory Hypoxia as an Early Predictor of Moderate to Severe COVID-19 Disease,"BackgroundThe importance of ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia in COVID-19 is unknown. Ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia may help objectively identify high-risk patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Interventions may be initiated earlier with sufficient lead-time between development of ambulatory hypoxia and other outcome measures.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to October 30, 2020 in ten hospitals in an integrated academic medical system in the Chicagoland area. We analyzed patients who had daily ambulatory oximetry measurements, excluding patients who had first ambulatory oximetry measurements after the use of oxygen therapies (nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies). We determined the association of ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia with the eventual need for nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies (defined as high flow nasal cannula, Bi-PAP, ventilator, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). We also calculated the time between development of ambulatory hypoxia and the need for oxygen therapies.

ResultsOf 531 patients included in the study, 132 (24.9%) had ambulatory hypoxia. Presence of ambulatory hypoxia was strongly associated with subsequent use of nasal cannula (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.8 - 8.4) and advanced oxygen therapy (IRR 7.7, 95% CI 3.4 - 17.5). Ambulatory hypoxia preceded nasal cannula use by a median 12.5 hours [IQR 3.25, 29.25] and advanced oxygenation therapies by 54 hours [IQR 25, 82].

ConclusionAmbulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia may serve as an early, non-invasive physiologic marker for the likelihood of developing moderate to severe COVID-19 and help clinicians triage patients and initiate earlier interventions.",Ajay Bhasin; Melissa Bregger; Mark Kluk; Peter Park; Joseph Feinglass; Jeffrey Barsuk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248209,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248209,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
357,A Comprehensive Clinical Description of Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Western Pennsylvania,"ObjectiveWe sought to characterize clinical presentation and healthcare utilization for pediatric COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania (PA).

MethodsWe established and analyzed a registry of pediatric COVID-19 in Western PA that includes cases in patients <22 years of age cared for by the pediatric quaternary medical center in the area and its associated pediatric primary care network from March 11 through August 20, 2020.

ResultsOur cohort included 424 pediatric COVID-19 cases (mean age 12.5 years, 47.4% female); 65% reported exposure and 79% presented with symptoms. The most common initial healthcare contact was through telehealth (45%). Most cases were followed as outpatients, but twenty-two patients (4.5%) were hospitalized: 19 with acute COVID-19 disease, and three for multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Admitted patients were younger (p<0.001) and more likely to have pre-existing conditions (p<0.001). Black/Hispanic patients were 5.8 times more likely to be hospitalized than white patients (p=0.012). Five patients (1.2%) were admitted to the PICU, including all three MIS-C cases; two required BiPAP and one mechanical ventilation. All patients survived.

ConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive snapshot of pediatric COVID-19 disease in an area with low to moderate incidence. In this cohort, COVID-19 was generally a mild disease; however, [~]5% of children were hospitalized.

358,Rapid processing of SARS-CoV-2 containing specimens for direct RT-PCR,"Widespread diagnostic testing is needed to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and manage the pandemic. Effective mass screening requires robust and sensitive tests that reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections with a low viral count. Currently, the most accurate tests are based on detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. We developed a method to process COVID-19 specimens that simplifies and increases the sensitivity of viral RNA detection by direct RT-qPCR, performed without RNA purification. In the method, termed Alkaline-Glycol Processing (AG processing), a SARS-CoV-2-containing biological specimen, such as saliva or a swab-collected suspension, is processed at pH 12.2 to 12.8 for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the AG-processed specimen is used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR. AG processing effectively lyses viruses and reduces the effect of inhibitors of RT-PCR that are present in biological specimens. The sensitivity of detecting viral RNA using AG processing is on par with methods that include a viral RNA purification step. One copy of SARS-CoV-2 virus per reaction, equivalent to 300 copies per ml of saliva, is detectable in the AG-processed saliva. The LOD calculated following U.S. FDA guidelines is 600 viral copies per ml of initial saliva specimen. AG processing works with saliva specimens or swab specimens collected into Universal Transport Medium (UTM), is compatible with heat treatment, and was confirmed to work with a range of CDC-approved RT-qPCR products and kits. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using AG processing with direct RT-qPCR provides a reliable and scalable diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can be integrated into a range of workflows, including automated settings.",Piotr Chomczynski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248183,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248183,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

360,Vaccine Prioritisation Using Bluetooth Exposure Notification Apps,"After vaccinating health care workers and vulnerable groups against COVID-19, authorities will need to decide how to vaccinate everyone else. Prioritising individuals with more contacts can be disproportionately effective, in theory, but identifying these individuals is difficult. Here we show that the technology underlying Bluetooth exposure notification applications, such as used for digital contact tracing, can be leveraged to prioritise vaccination based on individual contact data. Our approach is based on the insight that these apps also act as local sensing devices measuring each users total exposure time to other users, thereby enabling the implementation of a previously impossible strategy that prioritises potential super-spreaders. Furthermore, by generalising percolation theory and introducing a novel measure of vaccination efficiency, we demonstrate that this ""hot-spotting"" strategy can achieve herd immunity with up to half as many vaccines as a non-targeted strategy, and is attractive even for relatively low rates of app usage.",Mark D Penney; Yigit Yargic; Lee Smolin; Edward W Thommes; Madhur Anand; Chris T Bauch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248186,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248186,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
361,"Large differences in community COVID-19 testing across geographic areas in a Swedish region with 385,000 inhabitants","BackgroundSufficient community testing for suspected COVID-19 regardless of residential area is essential for a successful test-trace-isolate strategy.

AimThis study aimed to elucidate area level characteristics linked to testing rates.

MethodsFree-of-charge diagnostic tests (PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 was made available to the general public in late June 2020 in Uppsala County, Sweden, at four main test stations, and to a lesser extent at other health care units. We analysed 35,794 tests performed on individuals from 346 postal codes, from 24 June to 12 October 2020.

ResultsWe observed varying testing rates across postal code areas within Uppsala City as well as in Uppsala County. Testing rates were lower in areas characterized by longer distance to the nearest test station, lower neighbourhood deprivation index indicating higher deprivation (NDI) and higher proportion of inhabitants with foreign background. Multivariable regression models could not separate influences of foreign background and NDI on COVID-19 testing rates as these were collinear. Further, we did not detect any association between COVID-19 hospitalization rates and testing rates, indicating that underlying community infection rates did not substantially affect test frequency during this period.

ConclusionWe observed that testing rates were associated with distance to test station and socioeconomic and demographic circumstances. As lower testing rates can contribute to inequity in pandemic health effects, there is an urgent need to ensure adequate test accessibility in all parts of society.",Beatrice Kennedy; Mats Martinell; Ulf Hammar; Vera van Zoest; Robert S Kristiansson; Hugo Fitipaldi; Neli Tsereteli; Georgios Varotsis; Koen Dekkers; Jonas Bjork; Tove Fall,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248247,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248247,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

Overall, 879 students were randomly sampled and participated in this study. In an online survey, the randomly sampled participants nominated a friend, and reported their own and their nominated friends COVID-19 status. Nominated friends were about 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.00) times more likely to have ever been infected with COVID-19, compared to randomly sampled students. Our study corroborates the effectiveness of acquaintance sampling for identifying members of networks with higher COVID-19 risk.

363,REACT-1 round 7 updated report: regional heterogeneity in changes in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second national COVID-19 lockdown in England,"BackgroundEngland exited a four-week second national lockdown on 2nd December 2020 initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior results showed that prevalence dropped during the first half of lockdown, with greater reductions in higher-prevalence northern regions.

MethodsREACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England, designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 7 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 13th November 2020. A prior interim report included data from 13th to 24th November 2020 for 105,122 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round with swab results obtained up to 3rd December 2020.

ResultsBetween 13th November and 3rd December (round 7) there were 1,299 positive swabs out of 168,181 giving a weighted prevalence of 0.94% (95% CI 0.87%, 1.01%) or 94 per 10,000 people infected in the community in England. This compares with a prevalence of 1.30% (1.21%, 1.39%) from 16th October to 2nd November 2020 (round 6), a decline of 28%. Prevalence during the latter half of round 7 was 0.91% (95% CI, 0.81%, 1.03%) compared with 0.96% (0.87%, 1.05%) in the first half. The national R number in round 7 was estimated at 0.96 (0.88, 1.03) with a decline in prevalence observed during the first half of this period no longer apparent during the second half at the end of lockdown. During round 7 there was a marked fall in prevalence in West Midlands, a levelling off in some regions and a rise in London. R numbers at regional level ranged from 0.60 (0.41, 0.80) in West Midlands up to 1.27 (1.04, 1.54) in London, where prevalence was highest in the east and south-east of the city. Nationally, between 13th November and 3rd December, the highest prevalence was in school-aged children especially at ages 13-17 years at 2.04% (1.69%, 2.46%), or approximately 1 in 50.

ConclusionBetween the previous round and round 7 (during lockdown), there was a fall in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity nationally, but it did not fall uniformly over time or by geography.

We study the effects of the policy actions on the progression of the pandemic in the first containment period in spring 2020 before easing of measures have started to work by the end of April. To exploit both the time and spatial dimension in the dissemination of the virus, we conduct a spatial data panel analysis for German NUTS-3 regions. Specifically, we employ a spatial difference-in-differences approach to identify the effects of individual public health measures. We find that contact restrictions and closure of schools substantially contributed to flattening the infection curve. Additionally, a strong treatment effect of wearing face masks is established in the few treated regions during the containment phase. No incremental effect is evidenced for closure of establishments and shutdown of shopping malls and other stores. These findings prove to be highly robust to changes in model specification.

Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia.

MethodsWe conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from March 2nd to October 26th, 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the hazard risk ratio (HR) by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence, and socioeconomic strata.

ResultsThere were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between March 2nd and October 26th. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR=1.68 95% CI: 1.64-1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR=296.58 95% CI: 199.22-441.51), in indigenous people (HR=1.20 95% CI: 1.08-1.33), in people with subsidized health insurance regime (HR=1.89 95% CI: 1.83-1.96), and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR=1.44 95% CI: 1.24-1.68).

366,Social distancing and preventive practices of government employees in response to COVID-19 in Ethiopia,"BackgroundPublic health measures are critical to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Ethiopia has implemented a variety of essential public health measures in response to the spread of the virus. This study aimed to assess social distancing and preventive practices of government employees in response to COVID-19.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among 1573 government employees selected from 46 public institutions (16 National, 18 from Addis Ababa City Administration, and 12 from Oromia Regional State) located in Addis Ababa. Data were collected from 8th to 19th June 2020 using a paper-based self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. ANOVA and t-tests were applied to assess the difference between groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with outcome variables.

ResultsThe majority of the participants reported wearing of facemask (96%), avoiding close contact with people including handshaking (94.5%), frequent had washing (94.1%), maintaining physical distancing (89.5%), avoiding mass gatherings (88.1%), and restricting movement and travelling (84.1%). More than 80% of the participants perceived that consistently wearing a facemask is highly effective in preventing the transmission of coronavirus. Participants from Oromia reported statistically significantly lower odds of perceived effectiveness of facemask in preventing coronavirus infection (adjusted OR=0.27, 95% CI:0.17-0.45). About 19% of the respondents reported that they had ever tested for COVID-19. Participants within the age groups of 18-29 were more likely to test for coronavirus than the older age groups. Whilst, respondents from Oromia were less likely to test for coronavirus than those from national level (adjusted OR=0.31, 95% CI:0.16-0.60). About one-third (31.3%) of the respondents strongly agreed that the policy responses that the Government had taken to contain the spread of coronavirus were reasonable, and 38.5% agreed with the policy responses.

ConclusionsThe findings showed higher social distancing and preventive practices among the government employees in response to COVID-19. People should properly apply social distancing measures, wearing facemasks, and washing hands frequently with water and soap as a comprehensive package of SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control strategies.

367,Efficacy and Safety of Indomethacin in Covid -19 patients,"BackgroundIndomethacin, a well-known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has in addition broad spectrum anti-viral activity in the laboratory including on SARS-Cov-2 virus. This trial is to observe the likelihood of efficacy and safety of Indomethacin in treating RT-PCR positive Covid patients

Materials and MethodsThe study was done in two groups. In the first group of the study, where mild and moderate patients were involved, Propensity Score Matching was used as a methodology to compare Indomethacin and paracetamol based treatments in addition to the standard protocol for treating covid-19 patients.. Blood chemistry was collected before and after the treatment. The patients were monitored every day for clinical parameters. In this part, a patient developing hypoxia was the end point. In the second group, severe patients admitted with hypoxia were treated with Indomethacin in addition to Remdesivir, and the end point was the requirement of mechanical ventilation/admission to ICU.

ResultsIt was observed that patients treated with Indomethacin had a reduction in the number of days to become afebrile, reduction in cough and myalgia by half compared to the paracetamol set. Only one out of 72 patients in the Indomethacin arm of the first group required supplementary oxygen while 28 of the 72 patients required supplementary oxygen in the paracetamol arm. No one in the second group deteriorated enough to require mechanical ventilation. There wea no evidence of adverse reaction to indomethacin or deterioration of renal or liver function.

368,Uncertainty reduction in logistic regressions: a COVID-19 case-study using surrogate locations' asymptotic values,"Logistic regressions are subject to high uncertainty when the data are not past the inflection point. For example, for logistic regressions estimated with data up to or before inflection point, uncertainties in the upper asymptotic value K can be of the same order of magnitude of the population under analysis. This paper presents a method for uncertainty reduction in logistic regression using data from a surrogate logistic process. We illustrate the procedure using the Richards growth function (Generalized Logistic Function) to make predictions for COVID-19 evolution in Brazilian cities at stages before and during their epidemic inflection points. We constrain the logistic function regression with K calculated from selected surrogate international cities where the epidemic is clearly past its inflection point. Information gained with this constraint stabilizes the logistic regression, reducing the uncertainty in the curves parameters, including the rate of growth at the inflection point. The uncertainty is reduced even when the actual surrogate K is used just as an anchor to simulate different epidemic scenarios. Results predicted for COVID-19 trajectories within Brazil agree with actual data. These results suggest that in the absence of big data, a simple logistic regression may provide low uncertainty if surrogate cities have been identified for estimates of K, even if the specifics of the evolution in the surrogate cities are different. The method may be used for other logistic models and for other logistic processes in other areas such as economics and biology, if surrogate processes can be identified.",Bruno Hebling Vieira; Nathalia Hanna Hiar; George Cunha Cardoso,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248184,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248184,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
369,IMPACT OF A SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE,"ObjectiveThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread across the world causing a dramatic number of infections and deaths. No data are available about the effects of an infection in patients affected by celiac disease (CD) in terms of the development of related symptoms and antibodies. We aimed to investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in celiac patients.

DesignDuring a lockdown, the celiac patients living in the Milan area were contacted and interviewed about the development of COVID-19 symptoms as well as adherence to an anti-virus lifestyle and a gluten-free diet (GFD). They were also given a stress questionnaire to fill in. The development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (anti-RBD and N proteins) and the expression of the duodenal ACE2 receptor were investigated. When available, duodenal histology, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGA), presence of immunologic comorbidities and adherence to the GFD were analysed as possible risk factors.

Results362 celiac patients have been interviewed and 42 (11%) presented with COVID-19 symptoms. The presence of symptoms was not influenced by tTGA positivity, presence of duodenal atrophy or adherence to GFD. 37% of the symptomatic patients presented anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (Ig). Globally, 18% of celiac patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig vs 25% of the non-celiac control (p=0.18). The values of anti-RBD IgG/IgA and anti-N IgG did not differ from the non-celiac controls. Celiac patients had a significant lower level of anti-N IgA. The ACE2 receptor was detected in the non-atrophic duodenal mucosa of celiac patients; atrophy was associated with a lower expression of the ACE2 receptor.

ConclusionCD patients have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig positiveness and profile similar to non-celiac controls, except for anti-N IgA. The main celiac parameters and adherence to the GFD do not influence the development of a different Ig profile.

What is already known about this subject?The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread across the world causing infections and deaths. little is known about the possible relationship between autoimmune comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, and nothing it known about celiac disease.

What are the new findings?In a large cohort of celiac patients living in a high SARS-CoV-2 incidence area in Northern Italy, no difference was observed evidenced in terms of the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig and their IgG and IgA profile compared with the normal population

370,Mental and social health of children and adolescents with pre-existing mental or somatic problems during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 lockdown increases psychological problems in children and adolescents from the general population. Here we investigate the mental and social health during the COVID-19 lockdown in children and adolescents with pre-existing mental or somatic problems.

MethodWe included participants (8-18 years) from a psychiatric (N = 249) and pediatric (N = 90) sample, and compared them to a general population sample (N = 844). Measures were assessed during the first lockdown (April-May 2020) in the Netherlands. Main outcome measures were Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger, and Sleep-Related Impairment. Additionally, socio-demographic variables, COVID-19-related questions, changes in atmosphere at home from a parent and child perspective, and childrens experiences of lockdown regulations were assessed.

ResultsOn all measures except Global Health, the pediatric sample reported least problems. The psychiatric sample reported significantly more problems than the general population sample on all measures except for Anxiety and Peer Relationships. Having a COVID-19 affected friend/relative and a COVID-19 related change in work situation negatively moderated outcome, but not in the samples with pre-existing problems. All parents reported significant decreases in atmosphere at home, as did children from the general population.

ConclusionWe observed significant differences in mental and social health between three child and adolescent samples during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and identified COVID-19-related factors influencing mental and social health.

371,It makes you realise your own mortality: A qualitative study on mental health of older adults in the UK during COVID-19,"BackgroundOlder adults have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with high fatalities and health complications reported. Adults over the age of 70 in the UK were advised to self-isolate for 3 months early during the pandemic and it is unclear which factors influenced their experiences during this time.

ObjectiveThe aim of this qualitative study was to explore factors that threatened and protected the wellbeing of older adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook semi-structured interviews with 20 adults aged over 70. Purposive sampling methods were used to increase diversity within the group. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsParticipants were aged 72-93, 9 women and 11 men, 80% were White British, 40% lived alone. We identified 2 superordinate themes, including (1) Threats to wellbeing: mortality concerns, grief and loss of normal life, restricted health service access, COVID-19 concerns, and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing. (2) Factors protective of wellbeing: slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising, and use of past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that while older adults experienced challenges, many were resilient against COVID-19 restrictions despite early concerns of mental health consequences.

372,Risk of Stress/Depression and Functional Impairment in Denmark Immediately Following a COVID-19 Shutdown,"BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation.

MethodsUsing a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n=2,836) and again in July 2020 (n=1,526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture wellbeing and functioning. Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well to answers in re-interviews in July.

ResultsWe find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home. Measures of functional impairment also decline immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home. Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July, but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July.

Deep classification models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require large-scale datasets in order to be trained and perform properly. Since the number of X-ray samples related to COVID-19 is limited, transfer learning (TL) appears as the go-to method to alleviate the demand for training data and develop accurate automated diagnosis models. In this context, networks are able to gain knowledge from pretrained networks on large-scale image datasets or alternative data-rich sources (i.e. bacterial and viral pneumonia radiographs).

375,Development of a Rapid Point-Of-Care Test that Measures Neutralizing Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"As increasing numbers of people recover from and are vaccinated against COVID-19, tests are needed to measure levels of protective, neutralizing antibodies longitudinally to help determine duration of immunity. We developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) that measures levels of neutralizing antibodies in plasma, serum or whole blood. The LFA is based on the principle that neutralizing antibodies inhibit binding of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The test classifies high levels of neutralizing antibodies in sera that were titered using authentic SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotype neutralization assays with an accuracy of 98%. Sera obtained from patients with seasonal coronavirus did not prevent RBD from binding to ACE2. As a demonstration for convalescent plasma therapy, we measured conversion of non-immune plasma into strongly neutralizing plasma. This is the first report of a neutralizing antibody test that is rapid, highly portable and relatively inexpensive that might be useful in assessing COVID-19 vaccine immunity.",Douglas F.

376,Diagnostic accuracy of Loop mediated isothermal amplification coupled to Nanopore sequencing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection at scale in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations,"IntroductionRapid, high throughput diagnostics are a valuable tool, allowing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in populations, in order to identify and isolate people with asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Reagent shortages and restricted access to high throughput testing solutions have limited the effectiveness of conventional assays such as reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly throughout the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the use of LamPORE, where loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is coupled to nanopore sequencing technology, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations.

MethodsIn an asymptomatic prospective cohort, for three weeks in September 2020 health care workers across four sites (Birmingham, Southampton, Basingstoke and Manchester) self-swabbed with nasopharyngeal swabs weekly and supplied a saliva specimen daily. These samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Oxford Nanopore LamPORE system and a reference RT-qPCR assay on extracted sample RNA. A second retrospective cohort of 848 patients with influenza like illness from March 2020 - June 2020, were similarly tested from nasopharyngeal swabs.

ResultsIn the asymptomatic cohort a total of 1200 participants supplied 23,427 samples (3,966 swab, 19,461 saliva) over a three-week period. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection using LamPORE was 0.95%. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of LamPORE was >99.5% in both swab and saliva asymptomatic samples when compared to the reference RT-qPCR test. In the retrospective symptomatic cohort, the incidence was 13.4% and the sensitivity and specificity were 100%.

377,Predicting the need for escalation of care or death from repeated daily clinical observations and laboratory results in patients with SARS-CoV-2 during 2020: a retrospective population-based cohort study from the United Kingdom,"ObjectivesCurrently used prognostic tools for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are based on clinical and laboratory parameters measured at a single point in time, usually on admission. We aimed to determine how dynamic changes in clinical and laboratory parameters relate to SARS-CoV-2 prognosis.

Designretrospective, observational cohort study using routinely collected clinical data to model the dynamic change in prognosis of SARS-CoV-2.

Settinga single, large hospital in England.

Participantsall patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admitted to Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, UK from 1st February 2020 until 30th November 2020.

Main outcome measuresIntensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, death and discharge from hospital.

Statistical MethodsWe split patients into 1st (admissions until 30th June) and 2nd (admissions thereafter) waves. We incorporated all clinical observations, blood tests and other covariates from electronic patient records and follow up until death or 30 days from the point of hospital discharge. We modelled daily risk of admission to ICU or death with a time varying Cox proportional hazards model.

Results2,964 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included. Of 1,374 admitted during the 1st wave, 593 were eligible for ICU escalation, and 466 had near complete ascertainment of all covariates at admission. Our validation sample included 1,590 confirmed cases, of whom 958 were eligible for ICU admission. Our model had good discrimination of daily need for ICU admission or death (C statistic = 0.87 (IQR 0.85-0.90)) and predicted this daily prognosis better than previously published scores (NEWS2, ISCARIC 4C). In validation in the 2nd wave the score overestimated escalation (calibration slope 0.55), whilst retaining a linear relationship and good discrimination (C statistic = 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 -0.95)).

ConclusionsA bespoke SARS-CoV-2 escalation risk prediction score can predict need for clinical escalation better than a generic early warning score or a single estimation of risk at admission.

What is already known on this topicSARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged viral infection, which presents typically with flu like symptoms, can have severe sequelae and has caused a pandemic during 2020.

A number of risk factors for poor outcomes including obesity, age and comorbidity have been recognized.

Risk scores have been developed to stratify risk of poor outcome for patients with SARS-CoV-2 at admission, but these do not take account of dynamic changes in severity of disease on a daily basis.

What this study addsWe have developed a dynamic risk score to predict escalation to ICU or death within the next 24 hours.

Our score has good discrimination between those who will and not require ICU admission (or die) in both our derivation and validation cohorts.

378,Shared genetic etiology between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19 severity,"BackgroundIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex lung disease, characterized by progressive lung scarring. Severe COVID-19 is associated with substantial pneumonitis and has a number of shared major risk factors with IPF. This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity.

MethodsWe performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5x10-8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression.

FindingsWe detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0.31 [95% CI 0.04-0.57], P = 0.023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1.05, [95% CI 0.92-1.20], P = 0.43). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1.21, [95% CI 1.06-1.38], P = 4.24x10-3). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0.86, [95% CI 0.73-1.00], P = 2.99x10-2).

InterpretationThe strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.

381,Cyclic gallium-68 labeled peptides for specific detection of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,"In this study, we developed ACE2-specific, peptide-derived 68Ga-labeled radiotracers, motivated by the hypotheses that (1) ACE2 is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and (2) that modulation of ACE2 in COVID-19 drives severe organ injury.

MethodsA series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with 68Ga to generate peptide radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model.

ResultsCyclic DX-600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50s than their linear counterparts. The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50s similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule. Peptides were readily labeled with 68Ga, and the biodistribution of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort. Pharmacologic concentrations of co-administered NOTA-PEP (""blocking"") showed significant reduction of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine. Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results.

ConclusionsNOTA-conjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when N-conjugated for 68Ga chelation. In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine - organs known to be affected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 could be used to detect organ-specific suppression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected murine models and COVID-19 patients.

382,Choice of assemblers has a critical impact on de novo assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome and characterizing variants,"BackgroundCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic following its initial emergence in China. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced at an unprecedented rate and being deposited in public repositories. For the de novo assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a myriad of assemblers is being used, although their impact on the assembly quality has not been characterized for this virus. In this study, we aim to understand the variabilities on assembly qualities due to the choice of the assemblers.

ResultsWe performed 6,648 de novo assemblies of 416 SARS-CoV-2 samples using 8 different assemblers with different k-mers. We used Illumina paired-end sequencing reads and compared the genome assembly quality to that of different assemblers. We showed the choice of assemblers plays a significant role in reconstructing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two metagenomic assemblers e.g. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes performed better compared to others in most of the assembly quality metrics including, recovery of a larger fraction of the genome, constructing larger contigs and higher N50, NA50 values etc. We showed that at least 09% (259/2,873) of the variants present in the assemblies between MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes are unique to the assembly methods.

ConclusionOur analyses indicate the critical role of assembly methods for assembling SARS-CoV-2 genome using short reads and their impact on variant characterization. This study could help guide future studies to determine which assembler is best suited for the de novo assembly of virus genomes.",Rashedul Islam; Rajan Saha Raju; Nazia Tasnim; Md.

383,Identification of inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro enzymatic activity using a small molecule in-vitro repurposing screen,"Compound repurposing is an important strategy for the identification of effective treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL-Pro), also termed M-Pro, is an attractive drug target as it plays a central role in viral replication by processing the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at multiple distinct cleavage sites. We here report the results of a repurposing program involving 8.7 K compounds containing marketed drugs, clinical and preclinical candidates, and small molecules regarded as safe in humans. We confirmed previously reported inhibitors of 3CL-Pro, and have identified 62 additional compounds with IC50 values below 1 M and profiled their selectivity towards Chymotrypsin and 3CL-Pro from the MERS virus. A subset of 8 inhibitors showed anti-cytopathic effect in a Vero-E6 cell line and the compounds thioguanosine and MG-132 were analysed for their predicted binding characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex of myricetin and SARS-Cov-2 3CL-Pro was solved at a resolution of 1.77 [A], showing that myricetin is covalently bound to the catalytic Cys145 and therefore inhibiting its enzymatic activity.

384,Detection of long SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid sequences in peripheral blood monocytes collected soon after hospital admission,"Many different viruses infect circulating mononuclear cells to disseminate infection to diverse organs. Blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are being intensively studied as immunologic and pathologic responders to the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus (CoV19) but direct evidence showing CoV19 in these cells has not been published. PBMC myeloid cells that take up residence in various organs can harbor viral genomes for many years in lymphatic tissues, skin and brain, and act as a source for re-infection and/or post-viral organ pathology. To test if PBMC from acutely ill hospitalized patients contain viral nucleic acids, we first analyzed a standard short CoV19 nucleocapsid (NC) 72bp sequence. Because NC proteins protect the viral genome, we further analyzed longer (301nt) adjacent NC stretches by RNA/qPCR. In 2 of 11 patient PBMC, but no uninfected controls, longer NC sequences were positive as early as 2-6 days after hospital admission and were validated by sequencing. The presence of longer NC sequences indicates pathogenic fragments, or possibly the complete infectious virus, are carried by a rare population of monocytes, probably a subset of myeloid migratory cells. Predictably, such cells carried CoV19 to heart and brain with consequent late post-viral immune pathologies that are now evident.",Nathan Pagano; Maudry Laurent-Rolle; Jack Chunchieh Hsu; - Yale IMPACT Research Team; Chantal BF Vogels; Nathan D Grubaugh; Laura Manuelidis,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.423113,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.423113,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,False
385,Niclosamide inhibits SARS-CoV2 entry by blocking internalization through pH-dependent CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway,"Many viruses utilize the host endo-lysosomal network to infect cells. Tracing the endocytic itinerary of SARS-CoV2 can provide insights into viral trafficking and aid in designing new therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV2 is internalized via the clathrin and dynamin-independent, pH-dependent CLIC/GEEC (CG) endocytic pathway. Endosomal acidification inhibitors like BafilomycinA1 and NH4Cl, which inhibit the CG pathway, strongly block the uptake of RBD. Using transduction assays with SARS-CoV2 Spike-pseudovirus, we confirmed that these acidification inhibitors also impede viral infection. By contrast, Chloroquine neither affects RBD uptake nor extensively alters the endosomal pH, yet attenuates Spike-pseudovirus entry, indicating a pH-independent mechanism of intervention. We screened a subset of FDA-approved acidification inhibitors and found Niclosamide to be a potential SARS-CoV2 entry inhibitor. Niclosamide, thus, could provide broader applicability in subverting infection of similar category viruses entering host cells via this pH-dependent endocytic pathway.",Chaitra Prabhakara; Rashmi Godbole; Parijat Sil; Sowmya Jahnavi; Thomas S van Zanten; Dhruv Sheth; Neeraja Subhash; Anchal Chandra; Vijay Kumar Nuthakki; Theja Parassini Puthiyapurayil; Riyaz Ahmed; Ashaq Hussain Najar; Sai Manoz Lingamallu; Snigdhadev Das; Bhagyashri Mahajan; Praveen Kumar Vemula; Sandip B Bharate; Parvinder Pal Singh; Ram Vishwakarma; Arjun Guha; Varadharajan Sundaramurthy; Satyajit Mayor,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.422529,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.422529,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,False

An end-face plasma accelerator was used as a radiation source, which provides a power pulsed discharge in an open atmosphere. The high efficiency of inactivation of the infectiousness of the virus was shown within a short period of time.

387,One Year of SARS-CoV-2: How Much Has the Virus Changed?,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has caused a world-wide crisis with profound effects on both healthcare and the economy. In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, research groups have shared viral genome sequence data through the GISAID initiative. We collected and computationally profiled [~]223,000 full SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences from GISAID over one year for emergent nonsynonymous mutations. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at substantially different rates, with most viral proteins exhibiting little mutational variability. As anticipated, our calculations capture previously reported mutations occurred in the first period of the pandemic, such as D614G (Spike), P323L (NSP12), and R203K/G204R (Nucleocapsid), but also identify recent mutations like A222V and L18F (Spike) and A220V (Nucleocapsid). Our comprehensive temporal and geographical analyses show two periods with different mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome: December 2019 to June 2020 and July to November 2020. Some mutation rates differ also by geography; the main mutations in the second period occurred in Europe. Furthermore, our structure-based molecular analysis provides an exhaustive assessment of mutations in the context of 3D protein structure. Emerging sequence-to-structure data is beginning to reveal the site-specific mutational tolerance of SARS-CoV2 proteins as the virus continues to spread around the globe.",Santiago Vilar; Daniel G.

388,"The effectiveness of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions in reducing the outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK, an observational and modelling study.","Epidemiological models used to inform government policies aimed to contain the contagion of COVID-19, assume that the reproduction rate is reduced through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) leading to physical distancing. Available data in the UK show an increase in physical distancing before the NPIs were implemented and a fall soon after implementation. We aimed to estimate the effect of peoples behaviour on the epidemic curve and the effect of NPIs taking into account this behavioural component. We have estimated the effects of confirmed daily cases on physical distancing and we used this insight to design a bevavioural SEIR model (BeSEIR), simulated different scenaria regarding NPIs and compared the results to the standard SEIR. Taking into account behavioural insights improves the description of the contagion dynamics of the epidemic significantly. The BeSEIR predictions regarding the number of infections without NPIs were several orders of magnitude less than the SEIR. However, the BeSEIR prediction showed that early measures would still have an important influence in the reduction of infections. The BeSEIR model shows that even with no intervention the percentage of the cumulative infections within a year will not be enough for the epidemic to resolve due to a herd immunity effect. On the other hand, a standard SEIR model significantly overestimates the effectiveness of measures. Without taking into account the behavioural component the epidemic is predicted to be resolved much sooner than when taking it into account.",Giorgos Galanis; Corrado Di Guilmi; David L.

389,A safe protocol to identify low risk patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for outpatient management,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has made necessary to rationalize health-care resources, but there are no published data to this moment regarding ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

ObjectiveEvaluate the results of a protocol for ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia according to the rate of readmissions, admission into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and deaths. Identify unfavorable prognostic factors that increase the risk of readmission, ICU admission and/or death.

MethodsProspective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the emergency ward of Infanta Cristina Hospital (Madrid, Spain), that met the criteria of the hospital protocol for outpatient management. We describe outcomes of those patients and compare those who needed readmission versus those we did not. We use logistic regression to explore factors associated with readmissions.

Findings314 patients were included, of which 20 (6.4%) needed readmission, 3 (1%) developed severe respiratory failure, and none needed ICU admission nor died. 29.9% of patients had any one comorbidity. Hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased aminotransferases were associated to a higher risk of readmission. A clinical course of 10 days or longer, and an absolute eosinophil count over 200/{micro}L were associated with a lower risk. After multivariate analysis, only hypertension (OR 4.99, CI 1.54-16.02), temperature over 38{degrees}C in the emergency ward (OR 9.03, CI: 1.89-45.77), leukopenia (OR 4.92, CI 1.42-17.11) and increased LDH (OR 6.62, CI 2.82-19.26) remained significantly associated to readmission.

ConclusionOutpatient management of patients with low-risk COVID-19 pneumonia is safe, if adequately selected. The protocol presented here has allowed avoiding 30% of the admissions for COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital, with a very low readmission rate and non-existing mortality.

390,The association between work situation and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic: prospective cohort study in Norway,"ObjectivesTo analyse the population effects on life quality of being laid off from work, having to work from home, or having been diagnosed with COVID-19.

DesignNationwide population-based cohort study.

SettingNorway.

ParticipantsWe followed more than 80,000 participants in an ongoing cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed current life satisfaction in April and again in September/October 2020 for subjects whose work situation and infection status had changed.

Main outcome measuresSelf-reported satisfaction with life, using a scale from 0 (worst) to 10 (best).

ResultsTemporary and permanent layoffs, working from a home-based office, and getting a COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with modestly, but significantly lower concurrent life satisfaction, both on a population level and for subjects who changed status. The associations with change in work situation were stronger for men. For men with permanent job loss, the adjusted odds ratio for low life satisfaction (<6) was 3.2 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.2) in April and 4.9 (95% CI 3.5 to 6.9) in autumn. A suspected or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with an adjusted odds ratio for low life satisfaction of 1.9 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) in spring. The strength of associations between work situation and life satisfaction did not vary much across socio-economic strata, but layoffs were more common among those with low education.

ConclusionLayoffs, home office and infection status had clear impact on the quality of life as measured with a global life satisfaction scale. These findings suggest that social differentials in quality of life, are increasing during the pandemic.

FundingThis work was funded by the Norwegian Research Councils Centres of Excellence Funding Scheme (no. 262700) and by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH).

SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS- Being laid off from work or having to work from a home-based office is usually associated with reduced life quality.
- The population effect has not been estimated during the present surge in cases of COVID-19 in Europe.


What this study adds- This population-based study shows that life satisfaction in Norway has been stable from the first to the second wave of the pandemic, but that both layoffs and working from home is associated with reduced life satisfaction, especially among men.
- The reduced life satisfaction in people working from a home-based office implies that large proportions of the population are affected.",Ellen Oen Carlsen; Ida Henriette Caspersen; Helga Ask; Ragnhild Eek Brandlistuen; Lill Trogstad; Per Magnus,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248321,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248321,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
391,The role of metabolic comorbidity in COVID-19 mortality of middle-aged adults. The case of Mexico.,"BackgroundIn contrast to developed countries, in Mexico more than half of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in adults <65-years-old, with at least a million years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL) in eight months. Mexico has a young population but a high prevalence of metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes that contribute to COVID-19 adverse outcomes. COVID-19 could be particularly risky in population with specific comorbidity combinations that havent been analyzed.

MethodsTo explore what contributes to the high COVID-19 mortality in Mexican middle-aged adults, we calculated age-stratified COVID-19 case fatality rates, YLL and relative risk (RR) of 9 comorbidities and 23 comorbidity combinations in a retrospective Mexican cohort with 905,579 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases/89,167 deaths, until Nov/2/2020.

FindingsChronic kidney disease (CKD) had the highest RR for COVID-19 fatality, followed by diabetes and immunosuppression, that in turn had higher RR than obesity or hypertension as single comorbidities. The combination diabetes/hypertension with or without obesity had RR as high as CKD as a single comorbidity (>3 in <60-year-olds). Notably, the RR of comorbidities decreased with age, tending to values near 1 after age 60; suggesting that in Mexico, comorbidities increase COVID-19 fatality mostly in young and middle-aged adults. Our analysis suggests that advanced metabolic disease, marked by multimorbidity (more than one chronic disease per individual) or diabetes before age 60, contribute particularly to the younger age of COVID-19 fatalities in Mexico. Around 38% of YLL to COVID-19, were attributable to the synergy between COVID-19 and pre-existing diseases, mainly combinations between obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Yet, [1/4] of deaths and 1/3 of YLL have occurred in individuals without known comorbidities.

ConclusionsThe Mexican COVID-19 outbreak illustrates that middle-aged adults 45-64-yo can have high COVID-19 mortality during large outbreaks, especially if they present chronic metabolic comorbidities, but also in their absence, making them an important group of concern after elders. COVID-19 mortality in middle-aged adults is likely proportional to the gradual decline in health that accompanies ageing, which presents earlier in poorer populations that also get more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and have less access to specialized medical attention.",Lenin Dominguez-Ramirez; Francisco Rodriguez-Perez; Francisca Sosa-Jurado; Gerardo Santos-Lopez; Paulina Cortes-Hernandez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20244160,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20244160,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
392,"The impact of working during the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers and first responders: mental health, function, and professional retention","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front line health care workers (HCW) and first responders (FR). The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR.

ObjectivesTo assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current occupation.

DesignObservational, self-report in a convenience sample.

Participants118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States.

Main MeasureCOVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7).

Key ResultsStressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e-8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39, p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress frequency scores and work function impairment.

ConclusionsThese results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related stressors. They also suggest that mitigating COVID-19 related stressors when possible, such as by providing adequate personal protective equipment, can improve HCW and FR mental health, work function and retention in the health care work force.

393,Assessing the Safety of Home Oximetry for Covid-19: A multi-site retrospective observational study.,"ObjectivesTo determine the safety and effectiveness of home oximetry monitoring pathways safe for Covid-19 patients in the English NHS

DesignThis was a retrospective, multi-site, observational study of home oximetry monitoring for patients with suspected or proven Covid-19

SettingThis study analysed patient data from four Covid-19 home oximetry pilot sites in North West London, Slough, South Tees and Watford across primary and secondary care settings.

Participants1338 participants were enrolled in a home oximetry programme at one of the four pilot sites. Participants were excluded if primary care data and oxygen saturations are rest at enrolment were not available. 908 participants were included in the analysis.

InterventionsHome oximetry monitoring was provided to participants with a known or suspected diagnosis of Covid-19. Participants were enrolled following attendance to accident and emergency departments, hospital admission or referral through primary care services.

ResultsOf 908 patients enrolled into four different Covid-19 home oximetry programmes in England, 771 (84.9%) had oxygen saturations at rest of 95% or more, and 320 (35.2%) were under 65 years of age and without comorbidities. 52 (5.7%) presented to hospital and 28 (3.1%) died following enrolment, of which 14 (50%) had Covid-19 as a named cause of death. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients enrolled after admission to hospital (OR 8.70, 95% CI: 2.5 - 29.9), compared to those enrolled in primary care, Patients enrolled after hospital discharge (OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15 - 0.68) or emergency department presentation (OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20 - 0.89) were significantly less likely to present to hospital after enrolment than those enrolled in primary care.

ConclusionsThis study find that home oximetry monitoring can be a safe pathway for Covid-19 patients; and indicates increases in risk to vulnerable groups and patients with oxygen saturations < 95% at enrolment, and in those enrolled on discharge from hospital. Findings from this evaluation have contributed to the national implementation of home oximetry across England, and further work will be undertaken to evaluate clinical effectiveness of the new pathway.

Section 1: What is already known on this topicO_LIThe Covid-19 pandemic has created a new and significant burden on health systems globally.
C_LIO_LIOxygen saturations have been found to be an important factor to stratify patient risk and guide treatment of Covid-19.
C_LIO_LIHome oximetry programmes emerged during the early stages of the pandemic as an innovative means of monitoring patients with Covid-19 without admission to hospital.
C_LI

Section 2: What this study addsO_LIHome oximetry monitoring is associated with low rates of hospitalisation (5.7%) and all-cause mortality (3.1%). Many low-risk patients were enrolled in home oximetry pilots, and were associated with low rates of mortality.
C_LIO_LIHome oximetry monitoring may represent a safe and programme for the delivery of community care to Covid-19 patients with pre-existing risk factors including increased age, high BMI and clinical comorbidities but who do not meet clinical thresholds for hospital admission.

394,Stress perceived by students of the medical sciences in Cuba toward the COVID-19 pandemic: results of an online survey,"IntroductionThe aims of this study were to determine the usefulness of the Modified (10-items) Scale of Perceived Stress related to COVID-19 (EEP-10-C by its acronym in Spanish) and to identify the levels of stress perceived by students of the medical sciences in Cuba toward the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from fourteen Cuban Universities of Medical Sciences (n = 200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach alph. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as cut-off point the center of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale.

ResultsThe average age of the sample was 23.30 {+/-} 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.25 {+/-} 5,404). When applying the cut-off point [&ge;]25, only two students had high rates of stress perceived. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument; with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.755. The cutoff point [&ge;]20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress.

395,"Patient characteristics, clinical care, resource use, and outcomes associated with hospitalization for COVID-19 in the Toronto area","BackgroundPatient characteristics, clinical care, resource use, and outcomes associated with hospitalization for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Canada are not well described.

MethodsWe described all adult discharges from inpatient medical services and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU) between November 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19, influenza and all other conditions using multivariable regression models controlling for patient age, sex, comorbidity, and residence in long-term-care.

ResultsThere were 43,462 discharges in the study period, including 1,027 (3.0%) with COVID-19 and 783 (2.3%) with influenza. Patients with COVID-19 had similar age to patients with influenza and other conditions (median age 65 years vs. 68 years and 68 years, respectively, SD<0.1). Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (59.1%) and 11.7% were long-term care residents. Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater mortality (unadjusted 19.9% vs 6.1%, aRR: 3.47, 95%CI: 2.57, 4.67), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% vs 18.0%, aRR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.27, 1.83) and hospital length-of-stay (unadjusted median 8.7 days vs 4.8 days, aRR: 1.40, 95%CI: 1.20, 1.64), and not significantly different 30-day readmission (unadjusted 8.6% vs 8.2%, aRR: 1.01, 95%CI: 0.72, 1.42).

396,Pooling for SARS-CoV2 Surveillance: Validation and Strategy for Implementation in K-12 Schools,"Repeated testing of a population is critical for limiting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the safe reopening of educational institutions such as K-12 schools and colleges. Many screening efforts utilize the CDC RT-PCR based assay which targets two regions of the novel Coronavirus nucleocapsid gene. The standard approach of testing each person individually, however, poses a financial burden to these institutions and is therefore a barrier to using testing for re-opening. Pooling samples from multiple individuals into a single test is an attractive alternate approach that promises significant cost savings - however the of specificity and sensitivity of such approaches needs to be assessed prior to deployment. To this end, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of analyzing samples in pools of eight by the established RT-PCR assay. Participants (1,576) were recruited from amongst the Tufts University community undergoing regular screening. Each volunteer provided two swabs, one analyzed separately and the other in a pool of eight. Because the positivity rate was very low, we spiked approximately half of the pools with laboratory-generated swabs produced from known positive cases outside the Tufts testing program. The results of pooled tests had 100% correspondence with those of their respective individual tests. We conclude that pooling eight samples does not negatively impact the specificity or sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay and suggest that his approach can be utilized by institutions seeking to reduce surveillance costs.",Alexandra Marie Simas; Jimmy Walter Crott; Chris Sedore; Augusta Rohrbach; Anthony P Monaco; Stacey B Gabriel; Niall Lennon; Brendan Blumenstiel; Caroline Attardo Genco,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248353,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248353,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

Environmental testing showed widespread contamination of amplicons in lab spaces including notebooks, keyboards, glasses, and doorknobs. Minimizing instances of amplicon contamination and developing protocols for handling suspected cases are critical to propel research efforts and to avoid diverting university and healthcare resources from patients with COVID-19.

398,Does Contact Tracing Work? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from an Excel Error in England,"Contact tracing has been a central pillar of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, contact tracing measures face substantive challenges in practice and well-identified evidence about their effectiveness remains scarce. This paper exploits quasi-random variation in COVID-19 contact tracing. Between September 25 and October 2, 2020, a total of 15,841 COVID-19 cases in England (around 15 to 20% of all cases) were not immediately referred to the contact tracing system due to a data processing error. Case information had been truncated from an Excel spreadsheet due to a row limit, which was discovered on October 3. There is substantial variation in the degree to which different parts of England areas were exposed - by chance - to delayed referrals of COVID-19 cases to to the contact tracing system. We show that more affected areas subsequently experienced a drastic rise in new COVID-19 infections and deaths alongside an increase in the positivity rate and the number of test performed, as well as a decline in the performance of the contact tracing system. Conservative estimates suggest that the failure of timely contact tracing due to the data glitch is associated with more than 125,000 additional infections and over 1,500 additional COVID-19-related deaths. Our findings provide strong quasi-experimental evidence for the effectiveness of contact tracing.",Thiemo Fetzer; Thomas Graeber,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247080,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247080,2020-12-15,2020-12-15,,True
399,Foistar(Camostat mesylate) associated with the significant decrease in CRP levels compared to Kaletra(Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment in Korean mild COVID-19 pneumonic patients.,"BackgroundThere is limited information due to absence of virus titer and symptom related changes. Nonetheless, this is the first comparative study between the use of Foistar (Camostat mesilate) and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) on COVID-19 infection.

MethodsPatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that were admitted to Seoul Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) where is the largest public medical center in South Korea between August 1 and September 20, 2020 were included

The data of the patients with pneumonia who received Foistar (Foistar group) during their hospitalization period were primarily collected, and the patients who received Kaletra (Kaletra group) during their hospitalization period were matched to have a similar age group to that of Foistar group so that three times the number of Foistar group patients were randomly selected into Kaletra group and their body temperature, CRP level, WBC count, and event of diarrhea were collected, accordingly.

ResultsA total of 29 patients (7 Foistar group and 22 Kaletra group) was included. The median age was 69, and all had mild COVID-19 (WHO ordinal scale 3 or 4) on admission. 6 patients out of 7 patients (85.71%) from Foistar group who exhibited elevated CRP levels (CRP >0.4mg/dL) on admission have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range. In Kaletra group, 11 out of 18 patients (61.11%) have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range, and only 1 of 2 patients (50.00%) who had normal CRP level has maintained his or her normal CRP level. The difference in the white blood cell counts was not significant between two groups. None of the patients in the study had hyperkalemia.

ConclusionThis study has found a probable association of controlling inflammatory reactions and fever in COVID-19 patients with Foistar (camostat mesilate) use. In addition, there was no significant adverse drug event found from this study upon the Foistar use. These results may encourage the use of Foistar as a treatment option for the patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.",Jae-Phil Choi; Jae-Phil Choi; Hyoung-Jun Kim; Jumi Han; Sujung Park; JinJoo Han,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20240689,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20240689,2020-12-15,2020-12-15,,True
400,"Safety and immunogenicity trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-BBV152: a phase 1, double-blind, randomised control trial","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a TLR 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG).

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind randomized controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152. A total of 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each) prepared with 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel, and an Algel only control arm (n=75). Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on day 0 (baseline) and day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity based on the anti-IgG S1 response (detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and wild-type virus neutralization [microneutralization and plaque reduction neutralization assays]). Cell-mediated responses were also evaluated.

ResultsReactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events. The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved. One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-g and 6-g Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype.

ConclusionsBBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2{degrees}C and 8{degrees}C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for the phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are underway.

In this paper, we describe a multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated with ImmunoFormulation (IF), an add-on therapy developed to decrease duration of clinical symptoms. In parallel, a group of patients that did not receive IF was used for comparison (using standard of care treatment). A total of 39 patients were evaluated. Throughout the observational period, 90% of patients recovered in the IF cohort and 47.4% in the Control cohort (p=0.0057). From the symptoms with statistically significant differences, the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time to recover from it) was shorter in the IF cohort than in control cohort (in days, average), especially for fever (2.25 x 21.78), dry cough (4.38 x 24.00), dyspnoea (3.67 x 20.00), headache (2.00 x 26.50), diarrhoea (5.25 x 25.25), and weakness (1.92 x 23.30).

403,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection and Classification Using Phase Imaging with Computational Specificity,"Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis revealed that fast, accurate, and scalable testing is crucial for curbing the current impact and that of future pandemics. We propose an optical method for directly imaging unlabeled viral particles and using deep learning for detection and classification. An ultrasensitive interferometric method was used to image four virus types with nanoscale optical pathlength sensitivity. Pairing these data with fluorescence images for ground truth, we trained semantic segmentation models based on U-Net, a particular type of convolutional neural network. The trained network was applied to classify the viruses from the interferometric images only, containing simultaneously SARS-CoV-2, H1N1 (influenza-A), HAdV (adenovirus), and ZIKV (Zika). Remarkably, due to the nanoscale sensitivity in the input data, the neural network was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 vs. the other viruses with 96% accuracy. The inference time for each image is 60 ms, on a common graphic processing unit. This approach of directly imaging unlabeled viral particles may provide an extremely fast test, of less than a minute per patient. As the imaging instrument operates on regular glass slides, we envision this method as potentially testing on patient breath condensates.

The necessary high throughput can be achieved by translating concepts from digital pathology, where a microscope can scan hundreds of slides automatically.

Current in vivo methods to identify PPIs between a novel virus and humans are slow, costly, and difficult to cover the vast interaction space. We propose a novel deep learning architecture designed for in silico PPI prediction and a transfer learning approach to predict interactions between novel virus proteins and human proteins.

405,A blueprint for high affinity SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors from activity-based compound library screening guided by analysis of protein dynamics,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. The main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-COVID-19 agents. Unfortunately, unexpected difficulties have been encountered in the design of specific inhibitors. Here, by analyzing an ensemble of ~30,000 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro conformations from crystallographic studies and molecular simulations, we show that small structural variations in the binding site dramatically impact ligand binding properties. Hence, traditional druggability indices fail to adequately discriminate between highly and poorly druggable conformations of the binding site. By performing ~200 virtual screenings of compound libraries on selected protein structures, we redefine the proteins druggability as the consensus chemical space arising from the multiple conformations of the binding site formed upon ligand binding. This procedure revealed a unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro blueprint that led to a definition of a specific structure-based pharmacophore. The latter explains the poor transferability of potent SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, despite the identical sequences of the active sites. Importantly, application of the pharmacophore predicted novel high affinity inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, that were validated by in vitro assays performed here and by a newly solved X-ray crystal structure. These results provide a strong basis for effective rational drug design campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and a new computational approach to screen protein targets with malleable binding sites.",Jonas Goßen; Simone Albani; Anton Hanke; Benjamin P.

406,Potent SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization through maturation of iconic SARS-CoV-1 antibodies,"Antibodies against coronavirus spike protein potently protect against infection and disease, however it remains unclear if such protection can be extended to variant coronaviruses. This is exemplified by a set of iconic and well-characterized monoclonal antibodies developed after the 2003 SARS outbreak including mAbs m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R, which potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1, but not SARS-CoV-2. Here we explore antibody maturation strategies to change and broaden their specificity, enabling potent binding and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Using targeted mutagenesis as well as light chain shuffling on phage, we identified variants with considerably increased affinity and neutralization potential. The most potent antibody, derived from the NIH-developed mAb m396, neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 virus with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 160 ng/ml. Intriguingly, while many of the matured clones maintained specificity of the parental antibody, new specificities were also observed, which was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, indicating that a limited set of antibodies can give rise to variants targeting diverse epitopes.

The first whole genome assembly of SARS-CoV-2 was published on January 5 2020. Since then, over 150,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been made available. This large genomic resource has allowed tracing of the emergence and spread of mutations and phylogenetic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in near real time. Though, whether SARS-CoV-2 undergoes genetic recombination has been largely overlooked to date. Recombination-mediated rearrangement of variants that arose independently can be of major evolutionary importance. Moreover, the absence of recombination is a key assumption behind the application of phylogenetic inference methods.

409,"Azithromycin in Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","BackgroundAzithromycin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its immunomodulatory actions. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once daily by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other treatment arms). Patients were twice as likely to be randomised to usual care as to any of the active treatment groups. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 7 April and 27 November 2020, 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5182 patients to receive usual care alone. Overall, 496 (19%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 997 (19%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1{middle dot}00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}90-1{middle dot}12; p=0{middle dot}99). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. There was no difference in duration of hospitalisation (median 12 days vs. 13 days) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60% vs. 59%; rate ratio 1{middle dot}03; 95% CI 0{middle dot}97-1{middle dot}10; p=0{middle dot}29). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 22%; risk ratio 0{middle dot}97; 95% CI 0{middle dot}89-1{middle dot}07; p=0{middle dot}54).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, azithromycin did not provide any clinical benefit. Azithromycin use in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients where there is a clear antimicrobial indication.

410,"Social Media Study of Public Opinions on Potential COVID-19 Vaccines: Informing Dissent, Disparities, and Dissemination","The current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Little is known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the coming vaccines. We adopt a human-guided machine learning framework (using more than 40,000 rigorously selected tweets from more than 20,000 distinct Twitter users) to capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We aggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the major changes in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond to the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using multinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital, income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment of personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and causes of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines. The anti-vaccine opinion is the strongest among the people who have the worst personal pandemic experience. Next, by conducting counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccines for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine acceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-based study to analyze public opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines that can inform more effective vaccine distribution policies and strategies.",Hanjia Lyu; Junda Wang; Wei Wu; Viet Duong; Xiyang Zhang; Timothy D.

We also explore the Bayesian learning paradigm to estimate Rt. We calculate Rt for the top five most affected principal regions of Mexico. We present a forecast of the spread of coronavirus in Mexico based on a contact tracing model using Bayesian inference inspired in a data-driven approach. We investigate the health profile of individuals diagnosed with coronavirus in order to predict their type of patient care (inpatient or outpatient) and survival. Specifically, we analyze the comorbidity associated with coronavirus using Machine Learning. We implemented two classifiers, the first one, to predict the type of care procedure a diagnosed person with coronavirus presenting chronic diseases will obtain: outpatient or hospitalized. Second one, a classifier for the survival of the patient: survived or deceased.

412,Changes in cardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational cohort study,"ObjectiveTo quantify the impact and recovery in cardiovascular disease monitoring in primary care associated with the first COVID-19 lockdown.

DesignRetrospective nationwide primary care cohort study, utilising data from 1st January 2018 to 27th September 2020.

SettingWe extracted primary care electronic health records data from 514 primary care practices in England contributing to the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID). These practices were representative of English primary care across urban and non-urban practices.

ParticipantsThe ORCHID database included 6,157,327 active patients during the study period, and 13,938,390 patient years of observation (final date of follow-up 27th September 2020). The mean (SD) age was 38{+/-}24 years, 49.4% were male and the majority were of white ethnicity (65% [21.9% had unknown ethnicity])

ExposureThe primary exposure was the first national lockdown in the UK, starting on 23rd March 2020.

Main outcome measuresRecords of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and International Normalised Ratio (INR) measurement derived from coded entries in the primary care electronic health record.

ResultsRates of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and INR recording dropped by 23-87% in the week following the first UK national lockdown, compared with the previous week. The largest decline was seen in cholesterol (IRR 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15) and smallest for INR (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81).

Following the immediate drop, rates of recorded tests increased on average by 5-9% per week until 27th September 2020. However, the number of recorded measures remained below that expected for the time of year, reaching 51.8% (95% CI 51.8 to 51.9%) for blood pressure, 63.7%, (95% CI 63.7% to 63.8%) for cholesterol measurement and 70.3% (95% CI 70.2% to 70.4%) for HbA1c. Rates of INR recording declined throughout the previous two years, a trend that continued after lockdown. There were no differences in the times series trends based on sex, age, ethnicity or deprivation.

ConclusionsCardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care declined substantially from the time of the first UK lockdown. Despite a consistent recovery in activity, there is still a substantial shortfall in the numbers of recorded measurements to those expected.

413,Treatment provision for adults with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic: An exploratory study on patient and therapist experience with on-site sessions using face masks vs. telepsychiatric sessions,"BackgroundMaintaining the therapeutic care of psychiatric patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland required changes to the way in which sessions were conducted, such as telepsychiatric interventions or the use of face masks during on-site sessions. While little is known about how face masks affect the therapeutic experience of patients and therapists, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry is well documented for several psychiatric disorders. However, research on the benefits of telepsychiatry in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains scarce. This seems problematic since the symptoms typically associated with ADHD, such as attention problems and distractibility, may lessen the utility of telepsychiatry for this particular group. The present studys aim was to explore how adult patients with ADHD and their therapists experienced therapy sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic in three different settings: face-to-face with the therapist wearing a face mask, via telephone, or via videoconferencing.

MethodsIn this exploratory, quantitatively driven mixed-method study (quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative data from open-ended responses), we assessed patients evaluation of the session, their treatment satisfaction, and patients and therapists ratings of therapeutic alliance. We also collected qualitative comments on both sides experience of the session. Overall, 97 therapist and 66 patient questionnaires were completed. Results are reported for the N = 60 cases for which data from both parties were available. Sequential multiple regressions adjusted for therapist and number of sessions were used for the main quantitative analyses.

ResultsTelepsychiatric sessions were rated as significantly less deep than face-to-face sessions, an effect that was mainly driven by lower ratings in the videoconferencing group and, as suggested by further analyses, may decline over time. No other statistically significant differences were observed. Elements that were mentioned as facilitating or complicating a session differed markedly between patients and therapists.

ConclusionsBoth settings, on-site with the therapist wearing a face mask and telepsychiatric, seem to be valid options to continue treatment of adults with ADHD during a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Aspects such as patient preference, session content, and therapeutic methods may be useful to identify the most suitable modality.",Helen Wyler; Michael Liebrenz; Vladeta Ajdacic-Gross; Erich Seifritz; Susan Young; Pascal Burger; Anna Buadze,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20242511,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20242511,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
414,Self-harm presentations to Emergency Departments and Place of Safety during the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic: South London and Maudsley data on service use from February to June 2020.,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on both mental health service delivery, and the ways in which people are accessing these services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for around 1.2m residents in South London) have highlighted increased use of virtual contacts by mental health teams, with dropping numbers of face-to-face contacts over the first wave of the pandemic. There has been concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to higher mental health emergencies, particularly instances of self-harm. However, with people advised to stay at home during the  first wave lockdown, it is as yet unclear whether this impacted mental health service presentations. Taking advantage of SLaMs Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with daily updates of information from its electronic mental health records, this paper describes overall presentations to Emergency Department (ED) mental health liaison teams, and those with self-harm. The paper focussed on three periods: i) a pre-lockdown period 1st February to 15th March, ii) a lockdown period 16th March to 10th May and iii) a post-lockdown period 11th May to 28th June. In summary, all attendances to EDs for mental health support decreased during the lockdown period, including those with self-harm. All types of self-harm decreased during lockdown, with self-poisoning remaining the most common. Attendances to EDs for mental health support increased post-lockdown, although were only just approaching pre-lockdown levels by the end of June 2020.",Eleanor Nuzum; Evangelia Martin; Gemma Morgan; Rina Dutta; Christoph Mueller; Catherine Polling; Megan Pritchard; Sumithra Velupillai; Robert Stewart,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247155,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247155,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
415,"The seroprevalence and trends of SARS-CoV-2 in Delhi, India: A repeated population-based seroepidemiological study","BackgroundThree rounds of a repeated cross-sectional serosurvey to estimate the seroprevalence and trends of SARS-CoV-2 were conducted from August-October 2020 in the state of Delhi in India in the general population aged [&ge;]5 years.

MethodsThe selection of participants was through a multi-stage sampling design from all the 11 districts and 280 wards of the city-state, with two-stage allocation proportional to population- size. Household selected was via systematic random sampling, and individual participant selection through the age-order procedure. The blood samples were screened using the IgG ELISA COVID-Kawach kit (August Round), and the ERBALISA COVID-19 IgG (September and October) rounds. The seroprevalence was estimated by applying the sampling weights based on age and sex with further adjustment for the assay-kit characteristics.

ResultsA total of 4267 (n=15046), 4311 (n=17409), and 3829 (n=15015) positive tests indicative of the presence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 were observed during the August, September, and October 2020 serosurvey rounds, respectively. The adjusted seroprevalence declined from 28.39% (95% CI 27.65-29.14) (August) to 24.08% (95% CI 23.43-24.74) (September), and 24.71% (95% CI 24.01, 25.42%) (October). The antibody positivity was highest in the [&ge;]50 and female age-group during all rounds of the serosurvey, while the decline was maximum among the younger age-group (5-17 years). On adjusted analysis, participants with lower per capita income, living in slums or overcrowded households, and those with diabetes comorbidity had significantly higher statistical odds of antibody positivity.

ConclusionsDespite high IgG seroprevalence, there was evidence for waning of antibody positivity with the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, implying a potential reduction in population immunity, especially if also associated with the lack of trained T cell immunity.",Nandini Sharma; Pragya Sharma; Saurav Basu; Sonal Saxena; Rohit Chawla; Kumar Dushyant; Nutan Mundeja; Z SK Marak; Sanjay Singh; Gautam Kumar Singh; Ruchir Rustagi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248123,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248123,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
416,Identifying Synergistic Interventions to Address COVID-19 Using a Large Scale Agent-Based Model,"There is a range of public health tools and interventions to address the global pandemic of COVID-19. Although it is essential for public health efforts to comprehensively identify which interventions have the largest impact on preventing new cases, most of the modeling studies that support such decision-making efforts have only considered a very small set of interventions. In addition, previous studies predominantly considered interventions as independent or examined a single scenario in which every possible intervention was applied. Reality has been more nuanced, as a subset of all possible interventions may be in effect for a given time period, in a given place. In this paper, we use cloud-based simulations and a previously published Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 (Covasim) to measure the individual and interacting contribution of interventions on reducing new infections in the US over 6 months. Simulated interventions include face masks, working remotely, stay-at-home orders, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining. Through a factorial design of experiments, we find that mask wearing together with transitioning to remote work/schooling has the largest impact. Having sufficient capacity to immediately and effectively perform contact tracing has a smaller contribution, primarily via interacting effects.",Philippe J.

The aim of this review is (i) to synthesise the evidence on risk of infection and transmission among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced populations, and (ii) the effect of lockdown measures on these populations. We searched MEDLINE and WOS, preprint servers, and pertinent websites between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020. The included studies showed a high heterogeneity in study design, population, outcome and quality. The incidence risk of SARS-CoV-2 varied from 0{middle dot}12% to 2{middle dot}08% in non-outbreak settings and from 5{middle dot}64% to 21{middle dot}15% in outbreak settings.

418,COVID-19 vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not block infection need higher coverage and faster rollout to achieve population impact,"BackgroundSeveral COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in the final stage of testing. Interim trial results for two vaccines suggest at least 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease (VEDIS). It remains unknown whether this efficacy is mediated predominately by lowering SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility (VESUSC) or development of symptoms after infection (VESYMP). A vaccine with high VESYMP but low VESUSC has uncertain population impact.

MethodsWe developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to demographic, physical distancing and epidemic data from King County, Washington. Different rollout scenarios starting December 2020 were simulated assuming different combinations of VESUSC and VESYMP resulting in up to 100% VEDIS with constant vaccine effects over 1 year. We assumed no further increase in physical distancing despite expanding case numbers and no reduction of infectivity upon infection conditional on presence of symptoms. Proportions of cumulative infections, hospitalizations and deaths prevented over 1 year from vaccination start are reported.

ResultsRollouts of 1M vaccinations (5,000 daily) using vaccines with 50% VEDIS are projected to prevent 30%-58% of infections and 38%-58% of deaths over one year. In comparison, vaccines with 90% VEDIS are projected to prevent 47%-78% of the infections and 58%-77% of deaths over one year. In both cases, there is a greater reduction if VEDIS is mediated mostly by VESUSC. The use of a ""symptom reducing"" vaccine will require twice as many people vaccinated than a ""susceptibility reducing"" vaccine with the same 90% VEDIS to prevent 50% of the infections and death over one year. Delaying the start of the vaccination by 3 months decreases the expected population impact by approximately 40%.

ConclusionsVaccines which prevent COVID-19 disease but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby shift symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, will prevent fewer infections and require larger and faster vaccination rollouts to have population impact, compared to vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection. If uncontrolled transmission across the U.S. continues, then expected vaccination in Spring 2021 will provide only limited benefit.",David A Swan; Chloe Bracis; Holly Janes; Mia Moore; Laura Matrajt; Daniel B Reeves; Eileen Burns; Deborah Donnell; Myron S Cohen; Joshua Schiffer; Dobromir T Dimitrov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248142,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248142,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
419,Association of Mortality and Aspirin Prescription for COVID-19 Patients at the Veterans Health Administration,"There is growing evidence that thrombotic and inflammatory pathways contribute to the severity of COVID-19. Common medications such as aspirin, that mitigate these pathways, may decrease COVID-19 mortality. This assessment was designed to quantify the correlation between aspirin and mortality for COVID-19 positive patients in our care. Data from the Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database was utilized for the evaluation. Veterans from across the country with a first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result were included in the evaluation which comprised 28,350 patients from March 2, 2020 to September 13, 2020 for the 14-day mortality cohort and 26,346 patients from March 2, 2020 to August 28, 2020 for the 30-day mortality cohort. Patients were matched via propensity scores and the odds of mortality were then compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall mortality at 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46) and at 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), cutting the odds of mortality by more than half.

During 2015-2019, an average of 26,342 burials occurred each year from January to October. During the same period of 2020, there were 42,460 burials, an excess of 61%. Burial activities began surging in early January 2020, two months before the first official laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indonesia in March 2020. Analysis of civil death registrations or health authority death registration showed insensitive trends during 2020. Burial records indicated substantially increased mortality associated with the onset of and ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Jakarta and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission may have been initiated and progressing at least two months prior to official detection.

421,Predicting mortality in SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) positive patients in the inpatient setting using a Novel Deep Neural Network,"BackgroundThe second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be worse than the initial one and will strain the healthcare systems even more during the winter months. Our aim was to develop a machine learning-based model to predict mortality using the deep learning Neo-V framework. We hypothesized this novel machine learning approach could be applied to COVID-19 patients to predict mortality successfully with high accuracy.

MethodsThe current Deep-Neo-V model is built on our previously statistically rigorous machine learning framework [Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive Machine (FLAIM) framework] that evaluated statistically significant risk factors, generated new combined variables and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to predict mortality in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients in the inpatient setting. We analyzed adult patients ([&ge;]18 years) admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan with a working diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (n=1228). We excluded patients that were negative on COVID-19 on RT-PCR, had incomplete or missing health records. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we generated new variables and tested those statistically significant for mortality and in the third and final phase we applied deep neural networks and other traditional machine learning models like Decision Tree Model, k-nearest neighbor models and others.

ResultsA total of 1228 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 infection, we excluded 14 patients after the exclusion criteria and (n=)1214 patients were analyzed. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses while others were not. With most significant being septic shock (hazard ratio [HR], 4.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91-6.37), supportive treatment (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 2.01-6.14), abnormal international normalized ratio (INR) (HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.28-4.63), admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.22-4.74), treatment with invasive ventilation (HR, 3.21; 95% CI, 2.15-4.79) and laboratory lymphocytic derangement (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.6-4.86). Machine learning results showed our DNN (Neo-V) model outperformed all conventional machine learning models with test set accuracy of 99.53%, sensitivity of 89.87%, and specificity of 95.63%; positive predictive value, 50.00%; negative predictive value, 91.05%; and area under the curve of the receiver-operator curve of 88.5.

Single and multiple doses of molnupiravir were evaluated in this first-in-human, phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, which included evaluation of the effect of food on pharmacokinetics.

EIDD-1931 appeared rapidly in plasma, with a median time of maximum observed concentration of 1.00 to 1.75 hours, and declined with a geometric half-life of approximately 1 hour, with a slower elimination phase apparent following multiple doses or higher single doses (7.1 hours at the highest dose tested). Mean maximum observed concentration and area under the concentration versus time curve increased in a dose-proportional manner, and there was no accumulation following multiple doses. When administered in a fed state, there was a decrease in the rate of absorption, but no decrease in overall exposure.

Molnupiravir was well tolerated. Fewer than half of subjects reported an adverse event, the incidence of adverse events was higher following administration of placebo, and 93.3% of adverse events were mild. One discontinued early due to rash. There were no serious adverse events and there were no clinically significant findings in clinical laboratory, vital signs, or electrocardiography. Plasma exposures exceeded expected efficacious doses based on scaling from animal models; therefore, dose escalations were discontinued before a maximum tolerated dose was reached.

423,Decay of Fc-dependent antibody functions after mild to moderate COVID-19,"The capacity of antibodies to engage with innate and adaptive immune cells via the Fc region is important in preventing and controlling many infectious diseases, and is likely critical in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evolution of such antibodies during convalescence from COVID-19 is largely unknown. We developed novel assays to measure Fc-dependent antibody functions against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-expressing cells in serial samples from a cohort of 53 subjects primarily with mild-moderate COVID-19, out to a maximum of 149 days post-infection. We found that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging dimeric Fc{gamma}RIIa and Fc{gamma}RIIIa decayed linearly over time. S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declined linearly as well, in line with the decay of S-specific IgG. Although there was significant decay in S-specific plasma ADCC and ADP activity, they remained readily detectable by all assays in 94% of our cohort at the last timepoint studied, in contrast with neutralisation activity which was only detectable in 70% of our cohort by the last timepoint. Our results suggest that Fc effector functions such as ADCC and ADP could contribute to the durability of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, particularly late in convalescence when neutralising antibodies have waned. Understanding the protective potential of antibody Fc effector functions is critical for defining the durability of immunity generated by infection or vaccination.",Wen Shi Lee; Kevin John Selva; Samantha K Davis; Bruce D Wines; Arnold Reynaldi; Robyn Esterbauer; Hannah G Kelly; Ebene R Haycroft; Hyon-Xhi Tan; Jennifer A Juno; Adam K Wheatley; P Mark Hogarth; Deborah Cromer; Miles P Davenport; Amy W Chung; Stephen J Kent,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248143,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True

MethodsTwo paired anterior nasal swabs or two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each participant. Swabs were tested by the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and compared with real-time PCR (rt-PCR; Roche cobas 6800 platform). Positive- and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results stratified based on gender, age, duration of symptoms, and rt-PCR cycle threshold.

ResultsOut of the 512 participants, aged 0-90 years, of this prospective validation study, 414 (81%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 and 123 (24%) swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on rt-PCR testing. Compared with rt-PCR, the 12-minute swab test had 97.6% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity within 12 days of symptom onset, representing the period of infectivity. All (100%) samples detected within 33 rt-PCR cycles were also identified using the antigen test. Results were consistent across age and gender. Despite being performed by minimally trained healthcare workers, the user error rate of the test system was 1%.

ConclusionThe rapid high-sensitivity assay using nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal sampling may offer significant improvements for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinic- and community-based settings.

425,Public Preferences for Social Distancing Behaviors to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"Policies to promote social distancing can minimize COVID-19 transmission, but come with substantial social and economic costs. Quantifying relative preferences of the public for such practices can inform policy prioritization and optimize uptake. We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to quantify relative ""utilities"" (preferences) for five COVID-19 pandemic social distances strategies (e.g., closure of restaurants, restriction of large gatherings) against the hypothetical risk of acquiring COVID-19 and anticipated income loss. The survey was distributed in Missouri in May-June, 2020. We applied inverse probability sampling weights to mixed logit and latent class models to generate mean preferences and identify preference classes. Overall (n=2,428), the strongest preference was for the prohibition of large gatherings, followed by preferences to keep outdoor venues, schools, and social and lifestyle venues open, 75% of the population showing probable support for a strategy that prohibited large gatherings and closed lifestyle and social venues. Latent class analysis, however revealed four preference sub-groups in the population - ""risk eliminators"", ""risk balancers"", ""altruistic"" and ""risk takers"", with men twice as likely as women to belong to the risk-taking group. In this setting, public health policies which as a first phase prohibit large gatherings, as well as close social and lifestyle venues may be acceptable and adhered to by the public. In addition, policy messages that address preference heterogeneity, for example by targeting public health messages at men, could improve adherence to social distancing measures and prevent further COVID-19 transmission prior to vaccine distribution and in the event of future pandemics.

Significance StatementPreferences drive behavior - DCEs are a novel tool in public health that allow examination of preferences for a product, service or policy, identifying how the public prioritizes personal risks and cost in relation to health behaviors. Using this method to establish preferences for COVID-19 mitigation strategies, our results suggest that, firstly, a tiered approach to non-essential business closures where large gatherings are prohibited and social and lifestyle venues are closed as a first phase, would be well aligned with population preferences and may be supported by the public, while school and outdoor venue closures may require more consideration prior to a second phase of restrictions. And secondly, that important distinct preference phenotypes - that are not captured by sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex, race) characteristics - exist, and therefore that messaging should be target at such subgroups to enhance adherence to prevention efforts.",Ingrid Eshun-Wilson; Aaloke Mody; Virginia McKay; Matifadza Hlatshwayo; Cory Bradley; Vetta Thompson; David Glidden; Elvin H Geng,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.20248103,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.20248103,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
426,Deep Learning Fusion for COVID-19 Diagnosis,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has spurred a tremendous research boost aiming at controlling it. Under this scope, deep learning techniques have received even more attention as an asset to automatically detect patients infected by COVID-19 and reduce the doctors burden to manually assess medical imagery. Thus, this work considers a deep learning architecture that fuses the layers of current-state-of-the-art deep networks to produce a new structure-fused deep network. The advantages of our deep network fusion scheme are multifold, and ultimately afford an appealing COVID-19 automatic diagnosis that outbalances current deep learning methods. Indeed, evaluation on Computer Tomography (CT) and X-ray imagery considering a two-class (COVID-19/ non-COVID-19) and a four-class (COVID-19/ non-COVID-19/ Pneumonia bacterial / Pneumonia virus) classification problem, highlights the classification capabilities of our method attaining 99.3% and 100%, respectively.",Odysseas Kechagias-Stamatis; Nabil Aouf; John Koukos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20246546,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20246546,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
427,Estimation of COVID-19 risk-stratified epidemiological parameters and policy implications for Los Angeles County through an integrated risk and stochastic epidemiological model,"SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSHealth disparities have emerged with the COVID-19 epidemic because the risk of exposure to infection and the prevalence of risk factors for severe outcomes given infection vary within and between populations. However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations.

MethodsWe develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020.

FindingsWe estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR(t) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR(t) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits.

InterpretationThe risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.",Abigail L.

428,COVID-19 TARRACO Cohort Study: Development of a predictive prognostic rule for early assessment of COVID-19 patients in primary care settings.,"PURPOSEClinical course in COVID-19 patients is uncertain. This study investigated possible early prognostic factors among middle-aged and older adult and explored prognostic rules stratifying risk of patients.

METHODSCommunity-based retrospective cohort study that included 282 community-dwelling symptomatic patients [&ge;]50 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hospitalised and/or outpatient) during March-June 2020 in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Relationship between demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and early symptomatology (first 5-days) and risk of suffering critical outcome (ICU-admission/death) across clinical course was evaluated by logistic regression analyses, and simple predictive models were developed.

RESULTSOf the 282 cases (mean age: 65.9 years; 140 men), 154 (54.6%) were hospitalised (30 ICU-admitted) and 45 (16%) deceased. In crude analyses, increasing age, male sex, some comorbidities (renal, respiratory or cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension) and symptoms (confusion, dyspnea) were associated with an increased risk to suffer critical outcome, whereas other symptoms (rinorrhea, myalgias, headache, anosmia/disgeusia) were related with reduced risk. After multivariable-adjustment only age/years (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusion (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), dyspnea (OR: 5.41; 95% CI: 2.74-10.69; p<0.001) and myalgias (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) remained significantly associated with increased or reduced risk. A proposed CD65-M prognostic rule (including the above mentioned 4 variables) showed a good correlation with the risk of suffering critical outcome (area under ROC curve: 0.828; 95% CI: 0.774-0.882).

MethodsA cohort of 168 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients enrolled in a prospective observational study at a large European tertiary care center was analyzed.

ResultsForty-four percent (71/161) of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Shorter duration of symptoms before admission (aOR 1.22 per day less, 95%CI 1.10-1.37, p<0.01), age 60-69 as compared to 18-59 years (aOR 4.33, 95%CI 1.07-20.10, p=0.04), and history of hypertension (aOR 5.55, 95%CI 2.00-16.82, p<0.01) were associated with need for IMV. Patients on IMV had higher maximal concentrations, slower decline rates, and longer shedding of SARS-CoV-2 than non-IMV patients (33 days, IQR 26-46.75, vs 18 days, IQR 16-46.75, respectively, p<0.01). Median duration of hospitalization was 9 days (IQR 6-15.5) for non-IMV and 49.5 days (IQR 36.8-82.5) for IMV-patients.

431,Simulation-Based Study on the COVID-19 Airborne Transmission in a Restaurant,"COVID-19 has shown a high potential of transmission via virus-carrying aerosols as supported by growing evidence. However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor air flow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airborne infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation (LES) solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow-aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely-reported incidence. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the needs for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.",Han Liu; Sida He; Lian Shen; Jiarong Hong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247403,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247403,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
432,"CD177, a specific marker of neutrophil activation, is a hallmark of COVID-19 severity and death","COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits wide inter-individual clinical variability, from silent infection to severe disease and death. The identification of high-risk patients is a continuing challenge in routine care. We aimed to identify factors that influence clinical worsening. We analyzed 52 cell populations, 71 analytes, and RNA-seq gene expression in the blood of severe patients from the French COVID cohort upon hospitalization (n = 61). COVID-19 patients showed severe abnormalities of 27 cell populations relative to healthy donors (HDs). Forty-two cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components were elevated in COVID-19 patients. Supervised gene expression analyses showed differential expression of genes for neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, T- and B-cell receptors, EIF2 signaling, and ICOS-ICOSL pathways in COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised analysis confirmed the prominent role of neutrophil activation, with a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker. CD177 was the most highly differentially-expressed gene contributing to the clustering of severe patients and its abundance correlated with CD177 protein serum levels. CD177 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients from both the French and ""confirmatory"" Swiss cohort (n = 203) than in HDs (P< 0.01) and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P< 0.001), correlating with the time to symptoms onset (P = 0.002). Longitudinal measurements showed sustained levels of serum CD177 to discriminate between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01).

433,How the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the economics of U.S. emergency care,"ObjectiveWe describe how the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacted emergency department (ED) economics, acuity, and staffing.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of visits during January to September 2020 compared to 2019 in 136 EDs staffed by a national emergency medicine group. We created ratios of three-week moving averages for 2020 visits, acuity, costs divided by 2019 moving averages, by age and ED size. We tabulated reductions in clinician hours and FTEs compared to early 2020 staffing.

Results2020-2019 ED visit ratios declined in March nadiring mid-April for both adults (to 0.60) and children (to 0.30) and rose thereafter but remained below 2019 levels through September 2020. The ratio of adult RVUs/visit rose to 1.1 for adults and 1.2 for children in the early pandemic, falling to 1.04 and 1.1 through September. The ratio of direct salary expenses in freestanding (FSED) and small EDs declined less dramatically than in medium and large EDs. Clinical revenues in medium and large EDs declined more sharply and recovered slowly but plateaued well below 2019 levels. By September 2020, expenses were still higher than revenues for small EDs, similar for FSEDs, and somewhat higher for medium and large EDs. During the pandemic, physician hours fell 15% and APP hours 27% during COVID-19 translating to 174 lost physician and 193 lost APP FTEs.

434,Predicting the Peak and COVID-19 trend in six high incidence countries: A study based on Modified SEIRD model,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of almost a million people across the globe and this trend continues to rise rapidly day by day. The fear of getting infected by Corona virus is affecting the people emotionally, psychologically and mentally. They are not able to work to their full capacity and are also worried about the well beings of their near and dear ones. The National governments have taken up several measures like lockdowns, closing of educational institutions, and work from home for employees of companies wherever feasible. Governments are also advising people to take precautions like not to go out if not necessary, use of mask and keep a distance of appx. 6 ft. if you need to go out as the virus spreads from human to human in close proximity. These measures have helped to limit the spread of this virus in the past few months. However, due to rapid increase in the daily confirmed cases, it is becoming tougher for the governments to provide facilities like testing kits, hospitalization facilities, oxygen cylinders etc. to the infected persons. Thus, there is an urgent need to accurately estimate the number of cases in coming future that can help governments in acquiring the required resources. Further, to handle the economic distress caused by this virus, long-term planning is equally important. Focusing on these two aspects, this paper proposes to use the Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model to predict the peak and spread trend of COVID-19 in six countries namely USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia having the highest number of confirmed cases. As in COVID-19, even infected asymptomatic persons can spread the infection, the chosen model is well suited as exposed compartment of SEIRD model includes asymptomatic exposed individuals which are infectious. Epidemiological data till 9th September 2020 has been utilised to perform short-term predictions till 31st December 2020. Long-term predictions have been computed till 31st December 2023, to estimate the end of the virus in the above-mentioned six nations. Small values of MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) have been obtained for the models fitted to reported data for all the countries.

An analysis on a population-based sample in a high exposure setting,"BackgroundPerformance of three automated commercial serological IgG-based assays was investigated for assessing SARS-CoV-2 ever (past or current) infection in a population-based sample in a high exposure setting.

MethodsPCR and serological testing was performed on 394 individuals.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence was 42.9% (95% CI 38.1%-47.8%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.9%-45.5%), and 42.4% (95% CI 37.6%-47.3%) using the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively. Between the three assays, overall, positive, and negative percent agreements ranged between 93.2%-95.7%, 89.3%-92.8%, and 93.8%-97.8%, respectively; Cohen kappa statistic ranged from 0.86-0.91; and 35 specimens (8.9%) showed discordant results. Among all individuals, 12.5% (95% CI 9.6%-16.1%) had current infection, as assessed by PCR. Of these, only 34.7% (95% CI 22.9%-48.7%) were seropositive by at least one assay. A total of 216 individuals (54.8%; 95% CI 49.9%-59.7%) had evidence of ever infection using antibody testing and/or PCR during or prior to this study. Of these, only 78.2%, 74.1%, and 77.3% were seropositive in the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively.

436,Risk-driven responses to COVID-19 eliminate the tradeoff between lives and livelihoods,"BackgroundResponses to COVID-19 pandemic are conditioned by a perceived tradeoff between saving lives and paying the economic costs of contact-reduction measures. We develop and test the hypothesis that when populations endogenously respond to risk this tradeoff disappears.

MethodsWe develop a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission where populations endogenously reduce contacts in response to risk of death. We estimate the model for 118 countries constituting 7.05 billion people and assess the existence of a tradeoff between saving lives and livelihoods.

ResultsWe show that with endogenous responses communities go through three phases - rapid early outbreaks, control through initial response, and a longer period of quasi-equilibrium endemic infection with effective reproduction number (Re) fluctuating around one. Analytical characterization of this phase shows little tradeoff between contact reduction levels (underpinning economic costs) and death rates. Empirically estimating the model, we find no positive correlation (r = -0.241, p = 0.009) between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels across nations. While contact reduction levels are broadly similar across countries (5-95 percentile: 0.521-0.867 of pre-pandemic contacts), expected death rates vary greatly, by over two orders of magnitude (5-95 percentile: 0.03-17 deaths per million per day).

InterpretationWhether by choice or by the force of crippling death tolls, most societies will bring down interactions enough to contain SARS-CoV-2s spread. What we control is the severity of death toll required to compel us to act: greater responsiveness to risk can bring down deaths with no excess economic costs.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe study how endogenous changes in behaviors, in response to risk of death, moderate the tradeoff between deaths and interaction levels in communities exposed to COVID-19 pandemic. We searched for existing models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and how they incorporate changes in policies and behaviours in response to changing risk levels. Most common are the use of time-based changes in basic reproduction number to capture those behavioural responses, or empirically specified policies that have been enacted in response to the epidemic. These methods, while effective for empirical estimation of historical trajectories, do not inform the tradeoff we are seeking to understand. A smaller subset of prior work does include endogenous responses to risk, mostly in the form of policy switches that activate when risk exceeds some threshold, with notable exceptions that include continuous responses potentially more suitable for the study at hand. To our knowledge these prior formalizations do not focus on teasing out the perceived tradeoff between interaction levels in a community and public health burden of the epidemic. Therefore, the powerful intuition that a strong tradeoff exists between saving lives and livelihoods remains unchallenged.

Added value of this studyBy introducing an endogenous and continuous response function connecting perceived risk levels to contact levels, we examine the existence of a tradeoff between contact levels and death rates across communities. We find this extension leads to a long quasi-equilibrium phase during which effective reproduction number remains around 1. During this phase our model predicts little tradeoff between contact reductions (the driver of economic costs) and death rates. We find empirical support for this extension and its predictions using data from 118 countries constituting more than 7 billion people. While countries show limited variation in their estimated contact reduction levels, deaths vary by two orders of magnitude.

Implications of all available evidenceIn a pandemic individuals and communities respond to risk, not only by following government mandates, but also through their personal choices protecting their own and others lives. Formalizing this observation into models of contagion largely eliminates the tradeoff between saving lives and livelihoods in responding to a pandemic.

437,Maintenance therapy with infliximab or vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease is not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence: UK experience in the 2020 pandemic,"BackgroundThere has been great concern amongst clinicians and patients that immunomodulatory treatments for IBD may increase risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or progression to severe disease.

MethodsSera from 640 patients attending for maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab infusions between April and June 2020 at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK) and Royal London Hospital (London, UK) were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Demographic and clinical data were collated from electronic patient records and research databases.

ResultsSeropositivity rates of 3.0% (12/404), 7.2% (13/236), and 12.5% (7/56) were found in the Oxford and London adult IBD cohorts and London paediatric IBD cohorts respectively. Seroprevalence rates in the Oxford adult IBD cohort were lower than that seen in non-patient facing health-care workers within the same hospital (7.2%). Seroprevalence rates of the London paediatric IBD cohort were comparable to a contemporary healthy cohort collected at the same hospital (54/386, 13.6%).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rates are not elevated in patients with IBD receiving maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab infusions. There is no rationale based on these data for elective interruption of maintenance therapy, and we recommend continuation of maintenance therapy.

438,Modeling of aerosol transmission of airborne pathogens in ICU rooms of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure,"The COVID-19 pandemic has generated many concerns about cross-contamination risks, particularly in hospital settings and Intensive Care Units (ICU). Virus-laden aerosols produced by infected patients can propagate throughout ventilated rooms and put medical personnel entering them at risk. Experimental results found with a schlieren optical method have shown that the air flows generated by a cough and normal breathing were modified by the oxygenation technique used, especially when using High Flow Nasal Canulae, increasing the shedding of potentially infectious airborne particles. This study also uses a 3D Computer Fluid Dynamics model based on a Lattice Boltzmann Method to simulate the air flows as well as the movement of numerous airborne particles produced by a patients cough within an ICU room under negative pressure. The effects of different mitigation scenarii on the amount of aerosols potentially containing SARS-CoV-2 that are extracted through the ventilation system are investigated. Numerical results indicate that adequate bed orientation and additional air treatment unit positioning can increase by 40% the number of particles extracted and decrease by 25% the amount of particles deposited on surfaces 45s after shedding. This approach could help lay the grounds for a more comprehensive way to tackle contamination risks in hospitals, as the model can be seen as a proof of concept and be adapted to any room configuration.",Cyril Crawford; Emmanuel Vanoli; Baptiste Decorde; Maxime Lancelot; Camille Duprat; Christophe Josserand; Jonathan Jilesen; Lila Bouadma; Jean-Francois Timsit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247551,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
439,Acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield the vulnerable during the COVID-19 outbreak: a qualitative study in six Sudanese communities,"BackgroundShielding of high-risk groups from coronavirus disease (COVID-19), either within their households or safe communal structures, has been suggested as a realistic alternative to severe movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in low-income countries. To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan.

MethodsWe purposively sampled participants from six communities, illustrative of urban, rural and forcibly-displaced settings. In-depth telephone interviews were held with 59 members of households with one or more members at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Follow-up interviews were held with 30 community members after movement restrictions were eased across the country. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a two-stage deductive and inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsMost participants were aware that some people are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes but were unaware of the concept of shielding. Most participants found shielding acceptable and consistent with cultural inclinations to respect elders and protect the vulnerable. However, extra-household shielding arrangements were mostly seen as socially unacceptable. Participants reported feasibility concerns related to the social isolation of shielded persons and loss of income for shielding families. The acceptability and feasibility of shielding strategies were reduced after movement restrictions were eased, as participants reported lower perception of risk in their communities and increased pressure to comply with social commitments outside the house.

ConclusionShielding is generally acceptable in the study communities. Acceptability is influenced by feasibility, and by contextual changes in the epidemic and associated policy response. The promotion of shielding should capitalise on the cultural and moral sense of duty towards elders and vulnerable groups. Communities and households should be provided with practical guidance to implement feasible shielding options. Households must be socially, psychologically and financially supported to adopt and sustain shielding effectively.",Nada Abdelmagid; Salma A.E.

440,COVID-19 in persons affected by Hansen's disease in Brazil,"BackgroundHansens disease (HD) is endemic in Brazil, a country with the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest number of COVID-19 deaths. COVID-19 in persons affected by HD has not been described at population level in this country.

MethodsWe collated numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths among patients who were receiving routine treatment for HD at six centres across Brazil (Belem, Bauru, Brasilia, Vitoria, Petrolina, Palmas) between 1st March and 10th December 2020.

ResultsOf 1,333 HD patients receiving treatment, 70 (5.2%) reported having had COVID-19. Almost all patients (97% (1,296/1,333)) including all but one of the COVID-19 cases were receiving MDT comprising rifampicin (600mg once per month), dapsone (100mg daily), and clofazimine (50 mg daily plus 300 mg once per month). Four patients died, including a patient in their 30s on MDT who had a severe type 2 HD reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum) and who was taking clofazimine 100mg daily.

ConclusionsWe cannot determine from these preliminary data whether persons affected by Hansens disease have a higher or lower risk of COVID-19 and related mortality compared with the general population. We will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 in persons affected by and treated for HD and extend this to monitor SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in this group of patients.",Patrícia Deps; Taynah Repsold; Claudio Salgado; Raquel de Carvalho Bouth; Selma Regina Penha Silva Cerqueira; Marisa Simon Brezinscki; Rebeca Ruppert Galarda Baptista Peixoto; Jaison Antonio Barreto; Andrea Fonseca; Marlene Peixoto; Seyna Ueno Mendes; Rafael Pereira Rabelo Mendes; Pedro Paulo dos Santos Oliveira; Ciro Martins Gomes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247262,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247262,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
441,Mathematical assessment of the roles of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 dynamics: a multigroup modeling approach,"A novel coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing a pandemic that continues to inflict unprecedented public health and economic burden in all nooks and corners of the world. Although the control of COVID-19 has largely focused on the use of basic public health measures (primarily based on using non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine, isolation, social-distancing, face mask usage and community lockdowns), a number of exceptionally-promising vaccines are about to be approved for use in humans by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration. We present a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the candidate vaccines, particularly for the case where the vaccination program is complemented with a social-distancing control measure at a certain compliance level. The model stratifies the total population into two subgroups, based on whether or not they habitually wear face mask in public. The resulting multigroup model, which takes the form of a compartmental, deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parametrized using COVID-19 cumulative mortality data. Conditions for the asymptotic stability of the associated disease-free equilibrium, as well as expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold, are derived. This study shows that the prospect of COVID-19 elimination using any of the three candidate vaccines is quite promising, and that such elimination is more feasible if the vaccination program is combined with social-distancing control measures (implemented at moderate to high level of compliance).",Abba B Gumel; Enahoro A Iboi; Calistus N Ngonghala; Gideon A Ngwa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247916,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247916,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
442,Prevalence of Occupation Associated with Increased Mobility During COVID-19 Pandemic,"PurposeIdentifying geographic-level prevalence of occupations associated with mobility during local stay-at-home pandemic mandate.

MethodsA spatio-temporal ecological framework was applied to determine census-tracts that had significantly higher rates of occupations likely to be deemed essential: food-service, business and finance, healthcare support, and maintenance. Real-time mobility data was used to determine the average daily percent of residents not leaving their place of residence. Spatial regression models were constructed for each occupation proportion among census-tracts within a large urban area.

ResultsAfter adjusting for demographics, results indicate census-tracts with higher proportion of food-service workers, healthcare support employees, and office administration staff are likely to have increased mobility.

ConclusionsIncreased mobility among communities is likely to exacerbate COVID-19 mitigation efforts. This increase in mobility was also found associated with specific demographics suggesting it may be occurring among underserved and vulnerable populations. We find that prevalence of essential employment presents itself as a candidate for driving inequity in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.",Enbal Shacham; Stephen Scroggins; Matthew Ellis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20245357,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20245357,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
443,Screening for high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 identifies pre-symptomatic subjects among healthy healthcare workers,"BackgroundPre-symptomatic subjects are spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and strategies that could identify these subjects, particularly in hospital settings, are needed.

MethodsWe tested a cohort of 9449 employees at work at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, linked the screening results to sick leave records and examined the association between screening results and past or future sick leave using multinomial logistic regression.

ResultsWe found that healthcare workers with high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as indicated by the Cycle threshold (Ct) value in the PCR, had the highest risk for sick leave in the two weeks after testing (OR 11{middle dot}97 (CI 95% 6{middle dot}29-22{middle dot}80)) whereas subjects with low amounts of virus had the highest risk for sick leave in the past three weeks before testing (OR 6{middle dot}31 (4{middle dot}38-9{middle dot}08)). Only 2{middle dot}5% of employees were SARS-CoV-2 positive while 10{middle dot}5% were positive by serology and 1{middle dot}2% were positive in both tests. Serology-positive subjects were not at excess risk for future sick leave (OR 1{middle dot}06 (95% CI, 0{middle dot}71-1{middle dot}57)), but virus-positive subjects had a 7{middle dot}23 fold (95% CI, 4{middle dot}52-11{middle dot}57)) increased risk for sick leave within two weeks post testing.

ConclusionsScreening of asymptomatic healthcare workers for high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus using Ct values will identify pre-symptomatic subjects who will develop disease in the next few weeks. Identification of potentially contagious, pre-symptomatic subjects is likely critical for protecting patients and healthcare workers.

444,Association of University Reopening Policies with New Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in the United States,"Reopening of universities in the U.S. has been controversial in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We leveraged several publicly available data sources to study the association of county-level new confirmed COVID-19 case rates since September 1st and the number of students returning to campus across 2,893 U.S. counties with and without universities. In 1,069 U.S. counties with universities, we also studied the association of different reopening policies (online, in-person, hybrid) on new confirmed COVID-19 cases. Multivariate regression models estimated both effects of university reopening and different reopening policies. Mean number of daily confirmed cases per 10,000 county population was 1.51 from August 1st to August 31st, and 1.98 from September 1st to October 22nd. Mean number of students returning to universities was 2.1% (95% CI, 1.8% to 2.3%) of the county population and the number of students returning to campus had a positive association ({beta} = 2.006, p-value < 0.001) with new confirmed COVID-19 cases within the local county region where the institution resided. For U.S. counties with universities, the mean proportion of online enrollment within each county was 40.1% (95% CI, 37.4% to 42.8%), with most students enrolling in-person or hybrid mode. In comparison to holding class in-person, reopening universities online ({beta} = -0.329, p-value < 0.001) or in a hybrid mode ({beta} = -0.272, p-value = 0.012) was negatively associated with new confirmed COVID-19 cases. These findings could help public health officials consider policies to mitigate additional waves of infection during the upcoming winter.

Significance StatementOur study finds that higher numbers of students returning to campus was associated with an increase in new confirmed COVID-19 cases; reopening online or partially online was associated with slower spread of the virus, in comparison to in-person reopening.

445,Unique predictors of intended uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine,"IntroductionAn effective vaccine for COVID-19 is only of value if the public has confidence in taking it. There is little data on COVID-19-specific vaccine confidence or its determinants in the United States. The objective of this study was to determine public confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of Pennsylvanian adults, August-October, 2020, to identify their likelihood of taking an approved, no-cost coronavirus vaccine, general vaccine acceptance, and sociodemographic traits to identify predictors of vaccine acceptance.

ResultsOf the 950 respondents, 55% were ""very likely"", 20% ""somewhat likely"", 14% ""unsure"", 4% ""somewhat unlikely"", and 7% ""very unlikely"" to take a coronavirus vaccine, even though 70% had taken the flu vaccine since September 2019. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance were trust in the system evaluating vaccines and perceptions of local COVID-19 vaccination norms. The strongest predictors of negative vaccine intentions were worries about unknown side-effects and positive attitudes toward natural infection. Sociodemographic factors, political views, and religiosity did not predict vaccine intentions.

ConclusionsFewer adults intend to take a coronavirus vaccine than currently take the flu vaccine.

446,Assessing Durability of Vaccine Effect Following Blinded Crossover in COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials,"BackgroundSeveral candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 disease have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials and some have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. Efficacious vaccines should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which will occur before long-term efficacy and safety are known.

MethodsFollowing vaccination of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be derived by assuming the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both vaccine durability and potential vaccine-associated enhanced disease.

ResultsPost-crossover estimates of vaccine efficacy can provide insights about durability, identify waning efficacy, and identify late enhancement of disease, but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As vaccine efficacy estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior vaccine efficacy estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late vaccine efficacy. Further, open-label crossover may lead to riskier behavior in the immediate crossover period for the unblinded vaccine arm, confounding vaccine efficacy estimates for all post-crossover periods.

ConclusionsWe advocate blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess vaccine durability and potential delayed enhancement of disease. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunological and clinical effectiveness over time.",Dean Follmann; Jonathan Fintzi; Michael P.

447,Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission may prevent or dampen a spring wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths in 2021,"Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials assess vaccine efficacy against disease (VEDIS), the ability of a vaccine to block symptomatic COVID-19. They will only partially discriminate whether VEDIS is mediated by preventing infection as defined by the detection of virus in the airways (vaccine efficacy against infection defined as VESUSC), or by preventing symptoms despite breakthrough infection (vaccine efficacy against symptoms or VESYMP). Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEINF), defined as the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine recipients versus from infected placebo recipients, is also not being measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King County Washington, we demonstrate that if the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which have observed VEDIS>90%, mediate VEDIS predominately by complete protection against infection, then prevention of a fourth epidemic wave in the spring of 2021, and associated reduction of subsequent cases and deaths by 60%, is likely to occur assuming rapid enough vaccine roll out. If high VEDIS is explained primarily by reduction in symptoms, then VEINF>50% will be necessary to prevent or limit the extent of this fourth epidemic wave. The potential added benefits of high VEINF would be evident regardless of vaccine allocation strategy and would be enhanced if vaccine roll out rate is low or if available vaccines demonstrate waning immunity. Finally, we demonstrate that a 1.0 log vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to achieve VEINF=60% and that human challenge studies with 104 infected participants, or clinical trials in a university student population could estimate VESUSC, VESYMP and VEINF using viral load metrics.",David A Swan; Ashish Goyal; Chloe Bracis; Mia Moore; Elizabeth Krantz; Elizabeth R Brown; Fabian Cardozo-Ojeda; Daniel B Reeves; Fei Gao; Peter B Gilbert; Lawrence Corey; Myron S Cohen; Holly Janes; Dobromir Dimitrov; Joshua T Schiffer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248120,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248120,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
448,Profiling of oral microbiota and cytokines in COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 presence has been recently demonstrated in the sputum or saliva, suggesting how the shedding of viral RNA outlasts the end of symptoms. Recent data from transcriptome analysis show that oral cavity mucosa harbors high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, highlighting its role as a double-edged sword for SARS-CoV-2 body entrance or interpersonal transmission. In the present study, for the first time, we demonstrate the oral microbiota structure and inflammatory profile of COVID-19 patients. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients and matched healthy controls underwent naso/oral-pharyngeal and oral swabs. Microbiota structure was analyzed by 16S rRNA V2 automated targeted sequencing, while oral and sera concentrations of 27 cytokines were assessed using magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays. A significant diminution in species richness was observed in COVID-19 patients, along with a marked difference in beta-diversity. Species such as Prevotella salivae and Veillonella infantium were distinctive for COVID-19 patients, while Neisseria perflava and Granulicatella elegans were predominant in controls. Interestingly, these two groups of oral species oppositely clustered within the bacterial network, defining two distinct Species Interacting Group (SIGs). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were distinctive for COVID-19 in both oral and serum samples, and we found a specific bacterial consortium able to counteract them, following a novel index called C4 firstly proposed here. We even introduced a new parameter, named CytoCOV, able to predict COVID-19 susceptibility for an unknown subject at 71% of power with an AUC equal to 0.995. This pilot study evidenced a distinctive oral microbiota composition in COVID-19 subjects, with a definite structural network in relation to secreted cytokines.

To screen for antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) pseudovirus system using an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector with a luciferase reporter gene to screen 188 small potential antiviral compounds. Using this system, we identified nine compounds, specifically, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC50 values of 0.1-10 M. Mechanistic studies showed that these compounds, reported as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), inhibited Ca2+-mediated membrane fusion and consequently suppressed coronavirus entry. These candidate drugs showed broad-spectrum efficacy against the entry of several coronavirus pseudotypes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 [S-D614 and S-G614]) in different cell lines (293T, Calu-3, and A549). Antiviral tests using native SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells confirmed that four of the drugs (SC9/cepharanthine, SC161/hernandezine, SC171, and SC185/neferine) reduced cytopathic effect and supernatant viral RNA load.

Here we assess ten available HCV protease inhibitor drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. There is a striking structural similarity of the substrate binding clefts of SARS- CoV-2 Mpro and HCV NS3/4A proteases, and virtual docking experiments show that all ten HCV drugs can potentially bind into the Mpro binding cleft. Seven of these HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity, while four dock well into the PLpro substrate binding cleft and inhibit PLpro protease activity. These same seven HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero and/or human cells, demonstrating that HCV drugs that inhibit Mpro, or both Mpro and PLpro, suppress virus replication. Two HCV drugs, simeprevir and grazoprevir synergize with the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir to inhibit virus replication, thereby increasing remdesivir inhibitory activity as much as 10-fold.

451,Computational Analysis of Dynamic Allostery and Control in the three SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the COVID-19 pandemic, has no vaccine or antiviral drugs available to the public, at the time of writing. The virus non-structural proteins are promising drug targets because of their vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which covalently and competitively bind the active site of the non-structural proteins, but little has been done to address regions other than the active site, i.e. for non-competitive inhibition. Here we extend previous work on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (nsp5) to three other SARS-CoV-2 proteins: host shutoff factor (nsp1), papain-like protease (nsp3, also known as PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (nsp12, also known as RdRp) in complex with nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors. Using open-source software (DDPT) to construct Elastic Network Models (ENM) of the chosen proteins we analyse their fluctuation dynamics and thermodynamics, as well as using this protein family to study convergence and robustness of the ENM. Exhaustive 2-point mutational scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies suggest several new candidate regions, distant from the active site, for control of the proteins function, which may assist the drug development based on the current small molecule binding screens. The results also provide new insights, including non-additive effects of double-mutation or inhibition, into the active biophysical research field of protein fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.",Igors Dubanevics; Charles Heaton; Carlos Riechmann; Tom C B McLeish,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.422477,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.422477,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
452,Neuroinvasion and encephalitis following intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause neurological disease in humans, but little is known about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system. Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed at day 3 and declined at days 5 and 6 after infection. In contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals at days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.",Pratima Kumari; Hussin A Rothan; Janhavi P Natekar; Shannon Stone; Heather Pathak; Philip G Strate; Komal Arora; Margo A Brinton; Mukesh Kumar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422714,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422714,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
453,Surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 drive airway epithelial cells to induce interferon-dependent inflammation,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, robustly activates the host immune system in critically ill patients. Understanding how the virus engages the immune system will facilitate the development of needed therapeutic strategies. Here we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins Spike (S) and Envelope (E) activate the key immune signaling interferon (IFN) pathway in both immune and epithelial cells independent of viral infection and replication. These proteins induce reactive oxidative species generation and increases in human and murine specific IFN-responsive cytokines and chemokines, similar to their upregulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Induction of IFN signaling is dependent on canonical but discrepant inflammatory signaling mediators as the activation induced by S is dependent on IRF3, TBK1, and MYD88 while that of E is largely MYD88 independent. Furthermore, these viral surface proteins, specifically E, induced peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis in a mouse model. Finally we show that the organized inflammatory infiltrates are dependent on type I IFN signaling, specifically in lung epithelial cells. These findings underscore the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation and their potential for therapeutic intervention.

Author SummarySARS-CoV-2 robustly activates widespread inflammation, but we do not understand mechanistically how the virus engages the immune system. This knowledge will facilitate the development of critically needed therapeutic strategies to promote beneficial immune responses will dampening harmful inflammation. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins spike and envelope alone activated innate cell function and the interferon signaling pathway. This activation occurred in both immune and epithelial cells, and mechanistic studies demonstrated dependence on known key inflammatory signaling mediators, IRF3, TBK1, and MYD88. In animal studies, we showed that these viral surface proteins induce epithelial cell IFN-dependent lung pathology, reminiscent to acute COVID-19 pulmonary infection. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation.",Gautam Anand; Alexandra M Perry; Celeste L Cummings; Emma St. Raymond; Regina A Clemens; Ashley L Steed,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422710,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422710,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
454,Targeting Scavenger Receptor Type B-1 (SR-B1) and Cholesterol Inhibits Entry of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus in Cell Culture,"The novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has now caused a global pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is known as COVID-19. To date, few treatments for COVID-19 have proven effective, and the current standard of care is primarily supportive. As a result, novel therapeutic strategies are in high demand. Viral entry into target cells is frequently sensitive to cell membrane lipid composition and membrane organization. Evidence suggests that cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is most efficient when the target cell plasma membrane is replete with cholesterol; and recent data implicate cholesterol flux through the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoprotein (HDL), called scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), as critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we demonstrate that a cholesterol-poor synthetic biologic high-density lipoprotein (HDL NP) targets SR-B1 and inhibits cell entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus. Human cells expressing SR-B1 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and viral entry can be inhibited by 50-80% using HDL NPs in an SR-B1-dependent manner. These results indicate that HDL NP targeting of SR-B1 is a powerful potential therapy to combat COVID-19 and other viral diseases.",Stephen E Henrich; Kaylin M McMahon; Nicole Palacio; Pankaj Bhalla; Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster; Colby Shad Thaxton,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.420133,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.420133,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
455,SARS-CoV-2 Requires Cholesterol for Viral Entry and Pathological Syncytia Formation,"Many enveloped viruses induce multinucleated cells (syncytia), reflective of membrane fusion events caused by the same machinery that underlies viral entry. These syncytia are thought to facilitate replication and evasion of the host immune response. Here, we report that co-culture of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, results in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion, producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients. To assess the mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cell-cell fusion assay to screen [~]6000 drugs and >30 spike variants. Together with cell biological and biophysical approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for membrane cholesterol in spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Our findings provide a molecular basis for positive outcomes reported in COVID-19 patients taking statins, and suggest new strategies for therapeutics targeting the membrane of SARS-CoV-2 and other fusogenic viruses.

456,Recurrent emergence and transmission of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike deletion ΔH69/V70,"SARS-CoV-2 Spike amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) occur relatively frequently and some have a consequence for immune recognition. Here we report recurrent emergence and significant onward transmission of a six-nucleotide deletion in the S gene, which results in loss of two amino acids: H69 and V70. Of particular note this deletion, {Delta}H69/V70, often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F. One of the {Delta}H69/V70+ N501Y lineages, B.1.1.7, is comprised of over 1400 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the UK and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 ({Delta}H69/V70 and {Delta}144/145) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). Some of these mutations have possibly arisen as a result of the virus evolving from immune selection pressure in infected individuals and possibly only one chronic infection in the case of lineage B.1.1.7. We find the {Delta}H69/V70 enhances viral infectivity, indicating its effect on virus fitness is independent to the N501Y RBM change. Enhanced surveillance for the {Delta}H69/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a priority. Such ""permissive"" mutations have the potential to enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to generate vaccine escape variants that would have otherwise significantly reduced viral fitness.",Steven Kemp; William Harvey; Rawlings Datir; Dami Collier; Isabella Ferreira; Alessandro Carabelii; David L Robertson; Ravindra K Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422555,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422555,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
457,Decomposing the sources of SARS-CoV-2 fitness variation in the United States,"The fitness of a pathogen is composite phenotype determined by many different factors influencing growth rates both within and between hosts. Determining what factors shape fitness at the host population-level is especially challenging because both intrinsic factors like pathogen genetics and extrinsic factors such as host behaviour influence between-host transmission potential. These challenges have been highlighted by controversy surrounding the population-level fitness effects of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their relative importance when compared against non-genetic factors shaping transmission dynamics. Building upon phylodynamic birth-death models, we develop a new framework to learn how hundreds of genetic and non-genetic factors have shaped the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate the fitness effects of all amino acid variants and several structural variants that have circulated in the United States between February and September 2020 from viral phylogenies. We also estimate how much fitness variation among pathogen lineages is attributable to genetic versus non-genetic factors such as spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates. Up to September 2020, most fitness variation between lineages can be explained by background spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates across geographic regions. Furthermore, no genetic variant including the Spike D614G mutation has had a significant effect on population-level fitness. Instead, the rapid increase in the frequency of the Spike D614G can be explained by the variant having a spatial transmission advantage due to first establishing in regions with higher transmission rates during the earliest stages of the pandemic.",Lenora Kepler; Marco Hamins-Puertolas; David A Rasmussen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422739,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422739,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
458,The Potential for SARS-CoV-2 to Evade Both Natural and Vaccine-induced Immunity,"SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the surface of susceptible cells through extensive interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) anchored in cell membranes. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the spike protein are able to prevent antibody binding, yet while maintaining the ability to bind ACE2 and viral infectivity, mutations in the spike protein identified in cases of human infection were mapped to the crystallographically-determined interfaces between the spike protein and ACE2 (PDB entry 6M0J), antibody CC12.1 (PDB entry 6XC2), and antibody P2B-2F6 (PDB entry 7BWJ).

Both antibody binding interfaces partially overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Among 16 mutations that map to the RBD:CC12.1 interface, 11 are likely to disrupt CC12.1 binding but not ACE2 binding. Among 12 mutations that map to the RBD:P2B-2F6 interface, 8 are likely to disrupt P2B-2F6 binding but not ACE2 binding. As expected, none of the mutations observed to date appear likely to disrupt the RBD:ACE2 interface.

We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 with mutated forms of the spike protein may retain the ability to bind ACE2 while evading recognition by antibodies that arise in response to the original wild-type form of the spike protein. It seems likely that immune evasion will be possible regardless of whether the spike protein was encountered in the form of infectious virus, or as the immunogen in a vaccine. Therefore, it also seems likely that reinfection with a variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 may occur among people who recover from Covid-19, and that vaccines with the ability to generate antibodies against multiple variant forms of the spike protein will be necessary to protect against variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 that are already circulating in the human population.",Emily Shang; Paul Axelsen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.422567,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.422567,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,,False
459,Generation of a SARS-CoV-2 Replicon as a Model System to Dissect Virus Replication and Antiviral Inhibition,"SARS-CoV-2 research and antiviral discovery are hampered by the lack of a cell-based virus replication system that can be readily adopted without biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) restrictions. Here, the construction of a non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon and its application in deciphering viral replication mechanisms and evaluating SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors are presented. The replicon genome is replication competent but does not produce progeny virions. Its replication can be inhibited by RdRp mutations or by known SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds. Using this system, a high-throughput antiviral assay has also been developed. Significant differences in potencies of several SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in different cell lines were observed, which highlights the challenges of discovering antivirals capable of inhibiting viral replication in vivo and the importance of testing compounds in multiple cell culture models.

460,Evaluation of in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SARS-CoV-2 using confocal microscopy-based high content screening,"ContextSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged late in 2019 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There is an urgent need to develop curative and preventive therapeutics to limit the current pandemic and to prevent the re-emergence of Covid-19. This study aimed to assess the in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SRAS-CoV-2.

MethodsVero E6 cells were treated with copper gluconate 18 hours before infection. Cells were infected with a recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were maintained in fresh medium containing copper gluconate for an additional 48-hour period. The infection level was measured by the confocal microscopy-based high content screening method. The cell viability in presence of copper gluconate was assessed by XTT assay.

ResultsThe viability of Vero E6 cells treated with copper gluconate up to 200 M was found to be similar to that of untreated cells, but it dropped below 40% with 400 M of this agent. The infection rate was 23.8%, 18.9%, 20.6%, 6.9%, 5.3%,5.2% in cells treated with 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively. As compared to untreated cells, the number of infected cells was reduced by 71%, 77%, and 78% with 25, 50, and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively (p < 0.05).

ConclusionCopper gluconate was found to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Furthers studies are needed to determine whether copper homeostasis could play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

461,A novel cell culture system modeling the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global pandemic of COVID-19, and no effective antiviral agents and vaccines are available. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BLS-3) agent, impeding the basic research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2-GFP/{Delta}N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, we developed a convenient and efficient SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics tool to dissect the virus life cycle under a BSL-2 condition.

462,SARS-CoV-2 RNA reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome,"Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery, yet these patients most commonly are non-infectious1-14. Here we investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for PCR-positive tests. In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients. This novel feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain why patients can continue to produce viral RNA after recovery and suggests a new aspect of RNA virus replication.",Liguo Zhang; Alexsia Richards; Andrew Khalil; Emile Wogram; Haiting Ma; Richard A.

Here, we present the most comprehensive S-protein-based linear B-cell epitope candidate list by combining epitopes predicted by eight widely-used immune-informatics methods with the epitopes curated from literature published between Feb 6, 2020 and July 10, 2020. We find four top prioritized linear B-cell epitopes in the hotspot regions of S protein can specifically bind with serum antibodies from horse, mouse, and monkey inoculated with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates or a patient recovering from COVID-19. The four linear B-cell epitopes can induce neutralizing antibodies against both pseudo and live SARS-CoV-2 virus in immunized wild-type BALB/c mice.

466,Millisecond-scale molecular dynamics simulation of spike RBD structure reveals evolutionary adaption of SARS-CoV-2 to stably bind ACE2,"The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) protein interacts with host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry to host cells and initiate infection1-3. Detailed, accurate understanding of key interactions between S RBD and ACE2 provides critical information that may be leveraged in the development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Utilizing the published sequences and cryo-EM structures of both the viral S RBD and ACE24,5, we performed in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of free S RBD and of its interaction with ACE2 over the exceptionally long durations of 2.9 and 2 milliseconds, respectively, to elucidate the nature and relative affinity of S RBD surface residues for the ACE2 binding region. Our findings reveal that free S RBD has assumed an optimized ACE2 binding-ready conformation, incurring little entropic penalty for binding, an evolutionary adaptation that contributes to its high affinity for the receptor6. We further identified high probability molecular binding interactions that inform both vaccine design and therapeutic development, which may include recombinant ACE2-based spike decoys7 and/or allosteric S RBD-ACE2 binding inhibitors8,9 to prevent or arrest infection and thus disease.",Gard Nelson; Oleksandr Buzko; Aaron Bassett; Patricia R Spilman; Kayvan Niazi; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Patrick Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.422055,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.422055,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,,False
467,"Social and racial inequalities in COVID-19 risk of hospitalisation and death across Sao Paulo state, Brazil","BackgroundLittle evidence exists on the differential health effects of COVID-19 on disadvantaged population groups. Here we characterise the differential risk of hospitalisation and death in Sao Paulo state, Brazil and show how vulnerability to COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) notified from March to August 2020, in the Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de Sao Paulo (SIMI-SP) database. We examined the risk of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple datasets for individual-level and spatio-temporal analyses. We explained these inequalities according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking behaviour, and comorbidities.

FindingsThroughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were more likely to die when compared to patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR: 1{middle dot}60, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}48 - 1{middle dot}74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and July, 2020 (OR: 1{middle dot}08, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}04 - 1{middle dot}12). Black and Pardo individuals were more likely to be hospitalised when compared to White individuals (OR: 1{middle dot}37, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}32 - 1{middle dot}41; OR: 1{middle dot}23, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}21 - 1{middle dot}25, respectively), and were more likely to die (OR: 1{middle dot}14, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}07 - 1{middle dot}21; 1{middle dot}09, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}05 - 1{middle dot}13, respectively).

InterpretationLow-income and Black and Pardo communities are more likely to die with COVID-19. This is associated with differential access to healthcare, adherence to social distancing, and the higher prevalence of comorbidities.

468,Intention of health care workers to accept COVID-19 vaccination and related factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundConsidering medical and economic burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a high COVID-19 vaccination coverage among health care workers (HCWs) is an urgent need.

ObjectiveTo estimate the intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination and to find out related factors.

DesignWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this study.

Data sourcesWe searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, CINAHL and medRxiv from January 1, 2020 to December 02, 2020.

MethodsThe heterogeneity between results was very high and thus we applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects. We performed subgroup and meta-regression analysis to identify possible resources of heterogeneity.

ResultsEleven studies, including 8847 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The overall proportion of HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination was 55.9% (95% CI: 43.6-67.9%) with a wide range among studies from 27.7% to 81.5%. Intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination was higher in studies with moderate quality and in studies that were conducted in Europe. The following factors were associated with increased HCWs willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19: male gender, older age, physician profession, fewer work experience, comorbidity among HCWs, seasonal influenza vaccination, stronger vaccine confidence, positive attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived risk about COVID-19, and contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsHCWs represent a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reluctance or refusal of HCWs to vaccinate against COVID-19 could diminish the trust of individuals and trigger a ripple effect in the general public. Since vaccination is a complex behavior, understanding the way that HCWs take the decision to accept or not COVID-19 vaccination will give us the opportunity to develop the appropriate interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Knowledge of the factors that affect intention of HWCs to accept COVID-19 vaccination is limited and there is an urgent need for further and more valid studies.",Petros A Galanis; Irene Vraka; Despoina Fragkou; Angeliki Bilali; Daphne Kaitelidou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246041,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246041,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
469,Effects of photobiomodulation therapy combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intubation: a pragmatic randomized placebo-controlled trial,"BackgroundPhotobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) when used isolated or combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been proven benefits on skeletal muscle increasing performance and reducing fatigue, increasing oxygen saturation, and modulating inflammatory process. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with this therapy on respiratory muscles will be similar to the effects previously observed on skeletal muscles.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the respiratory function and modulating the inflammatory process.

MethodsWe conducted a prospectively registered, pragmatic, triple-blinded (patients, therapists and outcome assessors), randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PBMT-sMF in patients with severe COVID-19, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, admitted to the ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF (6 sites at the lower thorax - 189 J total, and 2 sites at the neck area - 63 J total) or placebo PBMT-sMF daily during all the ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of stay in the ICU defined by either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, muscle function of diaphragm, change in blood tests, change in mechanical ventilation parameters and change in arterial blood gas analysis.

ResultsA total of 30 patients underwent randomization (with 15 assigned to PBMT-sMF and 15 to placebo) and were analyzed. The length of stay in the ICU for the placebo group was 23.06 days while for the PBMT-sMF group was 16.26. However, there was no statistically difference between groups for the length of stay in the ICU (mean difference - MD = -6.80; 95% CI = -18.71 to 5.11). Regarding the secondary outcomes were observed statistically differences in favor of PBMT-sMF for diaphragm thickness, fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive protein, lymphocytes count, and hemoglobin (p<0.05).

ConclusionAmong patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, PBMT-sMF was not superior to placebo in decrease the length of stay in the ICU. In contrast, PBMT-sMF increased muscle function of diaphragm, improved ventilatory parameters, decreased C-reactive protein levels and hemoglobin count, and increased lymphocytes count.",Thiago De Marchi; Fabiano Francio; Joao Vitor Ferlito; Renata Monteiro Weigert; Cristiane Aparecida de Oliveira; Ana Paula Merlo; Delcio Luis Pandini; Bolivar Antonio Pasqual Junior; Daniela Frare Giovanella; Shaiane Silva Tomazoni; Ernesto Cesar Pinto Leal-Junior,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.02.20237974,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.02.20237974,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
470,Neurological Disorders associated with COVID-19 Hospital Admissions : Experience of a Single Tertiary Healthcare Centre,"BackgroundEarly reports have detailed a range of neurological symptoms in patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is a lack of detailed description and incidence of the neurological disorders amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We describe a range of neurological disorders (other than non-specific neurological symptoms), including their clinical, radiological and laboratory findings, encountered in our cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to a large tertiary institution.

MethodsWe reviewed our prospectively collated database of all adult Neurology referrals, Neurology and Stroke admissions and Neurological multi-disciplinary team meetings for all hospitalized patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 from 17 March 2020 to 31 August 2020.

ResultsTwenty-nine of 1243 COVID-19 inpatients (2.3%) presented with COVID-19-related neurological disorders. The mean age was 68.9 +/- 13.5(SD) years, age range of 34-97 years, and there were 16 males. 22 patients had confirmed, 5 were probable and 2 had suspected COVID-19 infection according to the WHO case classification. Eight patients (27%) required critical care admission. Neurological symptoms at presentation included acute confusion and delirium, seizures, and new focal neurological deficits. Based on the pre-defined neurological phenotype, COVID-19 patients were grouped into four main categories. 16 patients had cerebrovascular events (13 with acute ischaemic stroke and 3 had haemorrhagic features), 7 patients were found to have inflammatory, non-inflammatory and autoimmune encephalopathy (including 2 with known Multiple Sclerosis), whilst disorders of movement and peripheral nervous system were diagnosed in 3 patients each.

ConclusionAlthough the exact prevalence and aetiology remain unclear, new onset of neurological disorders, in addition to anosmia, is non-sporadic during the acute COVID-19-infection. Longitudinal follow-up of these patients is required to determine the clinical and functional outcome, treatment response and long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Permesh Singh Dhillon; Robert Dineen; Haley Morris; Radu Tanasescu; Esmaeil Nikfekr; Jonathan Evans; Cris S Constantinescu; Akram A Hosseini,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.22.20235184,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.22.20235184,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
471,How detection ranges and usage stops impact digital contact tracing effectiveness for COVID-19,"To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have adopted digital contact tracing apps. Various technologies exist to trace contacts that are potentially prone to different types of tracing errors. Here, we study the impact of different proximity detection ranges on the effectiveness and efficiency of digital contact tracing apps. Furthermore, we study a usage stop effect induced by a false positive quarantine. Our results reveal that policy makers should adjust digital contact tracing apps to the behavioral characteristics of a society. Based on this, the proximity detection range should at least cover the range of a disease spread, and be much wider in certain cases.

472,Routine asymptomatic testing strategies for airline travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: a simulation analysis,"BackgroundAirline travel has been significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission risk from importation. Routine viral testing strategies for COVID-19 may facilitate safe airline travel through reduction of individual and/or population-level risk, although the effectiveness and optimal design of these ""test-and-travel"" strategies remain unclear.

MethodsWe developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of airline travelers to evaluate the effectiveness of various testing strategies to reduce individual risk of infection and population-level risk of transmission. We evaluated five testing strategies in asymptomatic passengers: i) anterior nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) within 3 days of departure; ii) PCR within 3 days of departure and PCR 5 days after arrival; iii) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection); iv) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR 5 days after arrival; and v) PCR within 3 days of arrival alone. The travel period was defined as three days prior to the day of travel and two weeks following the day of travel, and we assumed passengers followed guidance on mask wearing during this period. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period (population-level transmission risk); the secondary outcome was the proportion of infectious persons detected on the day of travel (individual-level risk of infection). Sensitivity analyses were conducted.

FindingsAssuming a community SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 50 daily infections, we estimated that in a cohort of 100,000 airline travelers followed over the travel period, there would be a total of 2,796 (95% UI: 2,031, 4,336) infectious days with 229 (95% UI: 170, 336) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test (within 3 days prior to departure) reduced the number of infectious days by 35% (95% UI: 27, 42) and identified 88% (95% UI: 76, 94) of the actively infectious travelers on the day of flight; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 79% (95% UI: 71, 84). The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days by 32% (95% UI: 25, 39) and identified 87% (95% UI: 81, 92) of the actively infectious travelers; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 70% (95% UI: 65, 75). The post-travel PCR test alone (within 3 days of landing) reduced the number of infectious days by 42% (95% UI: 31, 51). The ratio of true positives to false positives varied with the incidence of infection. The overall study conclusions were robust in sensitivity analysis.

InterpretationRoutine asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 prior to travel can be an effective strategy to reduce individual risk of COVID-19 infection during travel, although post-travel testing with abbreviated quarantine is likely needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when traveling from a high to low incidence setting.",Mathew V Kiang; Elizabeth T Chin; Benjamin Q Huynh; Lloyd A C Chapman; Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer; Bryan Greenhouse; George W Rutherford; Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo; Diane Havlir; Sanjay Basu; Nathan C Lo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246132,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246132,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
473,Factors associated with clinical severity in Emergency Department patients presenting with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"ObjectiveTo measure the association of race, ethnicity, comorbidities, and insurance status with need for hospitalization of symptomatic Emergency Department (ED) patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

MethodsThis study is a retrospective case-series of symptomatic patients presenting to a single ED with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 12-August 9, 2020. We collected patient-level information regarding demographics, public insurance status (Medicare or Medicaid), comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared demographics and comorbidities of patients who were (1) able to convalesce at home, (2) required admission to general medical service, (3) required admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or (4) died within 30 days of the index visit. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with hospital admission versus ED discharge home.

ResultsIn total, 993 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 370 (37.3%) patients requiring hospital admission and 70 (7.1%) patients requiring ICU care. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or African American, to be Hispanic or Latino, or to have public insurance (either Medicaid or Medicare.) On multivariable logistic regression analysis comparing which patients required hospital admission, African-American race (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.8) and Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5-2.0) were not associated with need for admission but, public insurance (Medicaid: aOR 3.4, 95% CI 2.2-5.4; Medicare: aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.3; Medicaid and Medicare: aOR 3.6 95% CI 2.1-6.2) and the presence of hypertension (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), diabetes (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), obesity (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), heart failure (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-11.2), and hyperlipidemia (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) were identified as independent predictors of hospital admission.

ConclusionComorbidities and public insurance are predictors of more severe illness for patients with SARS-CoV-2. This study suggests that the disparities in severity seen in COVID-19 among African Americans and Hispanics are likely to be closely related to low socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions and do not reflect an independent predisposition to disease severity.",Sophia Newton; Benjamin Zollinger; Jincong Freeman; Seamus Moran; Alexandra Helfand; Kayla Authelet; Matthew McHarg; Nataly Montano Vargas; Robert Shesser; Joanna Cohen; Derek A.T.

MethodTotal 44 care homes across three states of western India were contacted for data collection during the period of September-November 2020. Structured interview of the manager or owner of the elderly care homes were taken to gather required information to achieve the study objectives.

ResultsOut of 44 care homes, seven care homes reported 146 case of corona virus infection and four deaths. Hence, the reported covid cases rate found to be 928 per 10,000 residents.

DiscussionResults of the study indicated that significant steps were taken by these old age care homes to stave off the infection spread among the inmates. It was observed that average 26% of the occupants were sent back to their home/relatives home before the lockdown to decongest the care homes.

476,Follow-up study on serum cholesterol profiles in recovered COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 patients develop hypolipidemia. However, it is unknown whether lipid levels have improved in recovered patients. In this study, a 3-6 month follow-up study was performed to examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59; severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). 61 patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values. LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). LDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p < 0.05). With adjustment of the factor of traditional Chinese medicine, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly improved at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p<0.001) and decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (p < 0.05) during patients recovery. Residue lesions were observed in CT images in 69% (42 of 61) of follow-up patients.

477,Neutralising antibodies drive Spike mediated SARS-CoV-2 evasion,"SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is critical for virus infection via engagement of ACE2, and amino acid variation in Spike is increasingly appreciated. Given both vaccines and therapeutics are designed around Wuhan-1 Spike, this raises the theoretical possibility of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. Here we report chronic SARS-CoV-2 with reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies in an immune suppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, generating whole genome ultradeep sequences by both short and long read technologies over 23 time points spanning 101 days. Although little change was observed in the overall viral population structure following two courses of remdesivir over the first 57 days, N501Y in Spike was transiently detected at day 55 and V157L in RdRp emerged. However, following convalescent plasma we observed large, dynamic virus population shifts, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain bearing D796H in S2 and {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 in the S1 N-terminal domain NTD of the Spike protein. As passively transferred serum antibodies diminished, viruses with the escape genotype diminished in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma. In vitro, the Spike escape double mutant bearing {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 and D796H conferred decreased sensitivity to convalescent plasma, whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. D796H appeared to be the main contributor to decreased susceptibility, but incurred an infectivity defect. The {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 single mutant had two-fold higher infectivity compared to wild type and appeared to compensate for the reduced infectivity of D796H. Consistent with the observed mutations being outside the RBD, monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD were not impacted by either or both mutations, but a non RBD binding monoclonal antibody was less potent against {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 and the double mutant. These data reveal strong selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy associated with emergence of viral variants with reduced susceptibility to neutralising antibodies.",Steven A Kemp; Dami A Collier; Rawlings Datir; Isabella ATM Ferreira; Salma Gayed; Aminu Jahun; Myra Hosmillo; Chloe Rees-Spear; Petra Mlcochova; Ines Ushiro Lumb; David Roberts; Anita Chandra; Nigel Temperton; - The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium; Katherine Sharrocks; Elizabeth Blane; - The CITIID-NIHR BioResource COVID-19 Collaboration; John A Briggs; Marit van Gils; Ken G Smith; John R Bradley; Chris Smith; Rainer Doffinger; Lourdes Ceron-Gutierrez; Gabriela Barcenas-Morales; David Pollock; Richard Goldstein; Anna Smielewska; Jordan P Skittrall; Theo Gouliouris; Ian G Goodfellow; Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas; Chris JR Illingworth; Laura E McCoy; Ravindra K Gupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.20241927,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.20241927,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

ObjectiveTo study the effect of AYUSH formulation (Kabasura Kudineer tablets, Shakti drops and Turmeric plus) as an add-on treatment in patients with mild COVID - 19

MethodologySingle centre, two arms, open labelled randomized controlled trial with a total of 30 patients (15 in the intervention arm and 15 in the standard care arm). Intervention arm received a combination of 3 AYUSH formulation along with the standard of care treatment for 21 days. All patients were followed for 28 days. Symptom severity (using Modified Jackson scale), negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (using RTPCR) and quality of life (WHOWOL BREF questionnaire) was assessed.

ResultsFifteen patients (93.8%) in the intervention group and twelve patients (92.3%) in the standard care arm had complete resolution of symptoms (P value= 0.36). Negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 was seen in thirteen patients (92.9%) in intervention arm and eleven patients (100%) in standard care arm at day 28 (P value = 0.56). There was no difference in the quality of life scores between the 2 groups.

ConclusionThe use of Ayush interventions as add-on therapy did not negatively impact the clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

479,"The burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population: Results from a statewide survey in Karnataka, India","BackgroundGlobally, the routinely used case-based reporting and IgG serosurveys underestimate the actual prevalence of COVID-19. Simultaneous estimation of IgG antibodies and active SARS-CoV-2 markers can provide a more accurate estimation.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering all risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnatakas infrastructure of 290 hospitals across all 30 districts. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence, while multinomial regression identified predictors.

FindingsThe overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27 {middle dot}3% (95% CI: 25 {middle dot}7-28 {middle dot}9), including IgG 16 {middle dot}4% (95% CI: 15 {middle dot}1 - 17 {middle dot}7) and active infection 12 {middle dot}7% (95% CI: 11 {middle dot}5-13 {middle dot}9). The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40, and the infection fatality rate was 0 {middle dot}05%. Influenza-like symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. The RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic participants compared to 47% in asymptomatic.

InterpretationThis is the first comprehensive survey providing accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden anywhere in the world. Further, our findings provide a reasonable approximation of population immunity threshold levels. Using the RAT kits and following the syndromic approach can be useful in screening and monitoring COVID-19.

480,Antibody landscape against SARS-CoV-2 proteome revealed significant differences between non-structural/ accessory proteins and structural proteins,"The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 proteome is largely unknown, especially for non-structural proteins and accessory proteins. Here we collected 2,360 COVID-19 sera and 601 control sera. We analyzed these sera on a protein microarray with 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, built an antibody response landscape for IgG and IgM. We found that non-structural proteins and accessory proteins NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b elicit prevalent IgG responses. The IgG patterns and dynamic of non-structural/ accessory proteins are different from that of S and N protein. The IgG responses against these 6 proteins are associated with disease severity and clinical outcome and declined sharply about 20 days after symptom onset. In non-survivors, sharp decrease of IgG antibodies against S1 and N protein before death was observed. The global antibody responses to non-structural/ accessory proteins revealed here may facilitate deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunology.

HighlightsO_LIAn antibody response landscape against SARS-CoV-2 proteome was constructed
C_LIO_LINon-structural/accessory proteins elicit prevalent antibody responses but likely through a different mechanism to that of structural proteins

In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. We show this Bayesian approach lead to accurate estimates of the epidemic curve and time-varying reproductive numbers and is robust to deviations from model assumptions. We apply the Bayesian approach to a COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproductive number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the ones based on the reported curve.",Tenglong Li; Laura F.

But little is done on validation of these models to fit adequately with multiple clinical data of an infectious disease. In this paper, we introduce SEIR-PAD model to assess susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, super-spreader, asymptomatic infected, and deceased populations. SEIR-PAD model consists of 7-set of ordinary differential equations with 8 unknown coefficients which are solved numerically in MATLAB using an optimization algorithm. Four set of COVID-19 clinical data consist of cumulative populations of infected, deceased, recovered, and susceptible are used from start of the outbreak until 23rd June 2020 to fit with SEIR-PAD model results. Results for trends of COVID-19 in GCC countries indicate that the disease may be terminated after 200 to 300 days from start of the outbreak depends on current measures and policies. SEIR-PAD model provides a robust and strong tool to predict trends of COVID-19 for better management and/or foreseeing effects of certain enforcing laws by governments, health organizations or policy makers.",ahmad Sedaghat; Seyed Amir Abbas Oloomi; Mahdi Ashtian Malayer; Amir MOSAVI,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.29.20240515,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.29.20240515,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

484,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students' health and financial stability in New York City: Findings from a population-based sample of City University of New York (CUNY) students,"Understanding the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on students health and financial stability is important to establish effective interventions to mitigate these effects, which may have long-term consequences on their health and wellbeing. Public universities in urban centers represent a substantial proportion of college students in the United States. We implemented a cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2,282 students in a large, public university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for non-response and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and half (49.8%) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR=1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR=1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the strongest predictors of anxiety/depression. Household and personal experiences with possible COVID-19 symptoms were also associated with anxiety/depression or the need for increased mental health services. Addressing student needs at public urban universities requires an integrated holistic approach that targets urgent mental health and economic needs related to the impact of COVID-19.

485,Impact of Convalescent Plasma Transfusion (CCP) In Patients With Previous Circulating Neutralizing Antibodies (nAb) to COVID-19,"INTRODUCTIONCOVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) transfusion has emerged in the past months as an alternative approach to treat pneumonia cases of SARS-CoV-2. Current evidence regarding characteristics of the plasma product, the titer of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the transfused units, time to onset of intervention, and impact of nAbs produced by the patient are limited and heterogeneous.

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe describe the preliminary results of 104 patients with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 transfused with CCP at three medical centers in Brazil. All enrolled patients were transfused with doses between 200 mL through 600mL of ABO compatible CCP on days 0-2 after enrolment. Clinical parameters were monitored and nAbs titration was performed using the cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test with SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank MT126808.1).

RESULTSForty-one patients achieved clinical improvement on day 14, and multivariable logistic regression showed that nAbs T (from CCP units transfused) (p= 0.001), nAbs P0 (on day of enrolment) (p=0.009) and use of other supportive therapies (p<0.001) were associated with higher odds for this clinical improvement. Considering ICU length of stay (LOS) and length of mechanical ventilation, in our analysis, nAbs P0 were associated with a significant reduction in ICU LOS (p=0.018) and duration of mechanical ventilation (p<0.001). Administration of CCP after 10 days of symptom onset was associated with increases in ICU length of stay (p<0.001).

DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONDespite the study limitations, our data have shown an association between patients previously acquired nAbs and clinical outcomes. The potential value of timely administration of CCP transfusion before day 10 of disease onset was demonstrated and nAbsP0, but not nAbsT, were associated with ICU LOS, and duration of mechanical ventilation on the improvement of clinical outcomes was also demonstrated. In conclusion, we consider these data are useful parameters to guide future CPP transfusion strategies to COVID-19.",Ana Paula Hitomi Yokoyama; Silvano Wendel; Carolina Bonet-Bub; Roberta M Fachini; Ana Paula F Dametto; Fernando Blumm; Valeria F Dutra; Gabriela Candelaria; Araci M Sakashita; Rafael Rahal Guaragna Machado; Rita Fontao-Wendel; Nelson Hamerschlak; Ruth Achkar; Murillo Assuncao; Patricia Scuracchio; Victor Nudelman; Laerte Pastore; Joao Renato R Pinho; Mirian Dal Ben; Roberto Kalil Filho; Alexandre R Marra; Mariane T Amano; Esper Kallas; Alfredo Salim Helito; Carlos Roberto R Carvalho; Danielle Bastos Araujo; Edison Luiz Durigon; Anamaria A Camargo; Luiz V Rizzo; Luiz Fernando L Reis; Jose Mauro Kutner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246173,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246173,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
486,BNT162b2 induces SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies and T cells in humans,"BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S) stabilized in the prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, we reported preliminary BNT162b2 safety and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 vaccine trial1. We present here antibody and T cell responses from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 19-55 years of age, after BNT162b2 prime/boost vaccination at 1 to 30 {micro}g dose levels. BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with S-binding IgG concentrations above those in a COVID-19 human convalescent sample (HCS) panel. Day 29 (7 days post-boost) SARS-CoV-2 serum 50% neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.3-fold (1 {micro}g) to 3.3-fold (30 {micro}g) those of the HCS panel. The BNT162b2-elicited sera neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Concurrently, in most participants, S-specific CD8+ and T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells had expanded, with a high fraction producing interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma}). Using peptide MHC multimers, the epitopes recognised by several BNT162b2-induced CD8+ T cells when presented on frequent MHC alleles were identified. CD8+ T cells were shown to be of the early-differentiated effector-memory phenotype, with single specificities reaching 0.01-3% of circulating CD8+ T cells. In summary, vaccination with BNT162b2 at well tolerated doses elicits a combined adaptive humoral and cellular immune response, which together may contribute to protection against COVID-19.",Ugur Sahin; Alexander Muik; Isabel Vogler; Evelyna Derhovanessian; Lena M Kranz; Mathias Vormehr; Jasmin Quandt; Nicole Bidmon; Alexander Ulges; Alina Baum; Kristen Pascal; Daniel Maurus; Sebastian Brachtendorf; Verena L Loerks; Julian Sikorski; Peter Koch; Rolf Hilker; Dirk Becker; Ann-Kathrin Eller; Jan Gruetzner; Manuel Tonigold; Carsten Boesler; Corinna Rosenbaum; Ludwig Heesen; Marie-Cristine Kuehnle; Asaf Poran; Jesse Z Dong; Ulrich Luxemburger; Alexandra Kemmer-Brueck; David Langer; Martin Bexon; Stefanie Bolte; Tania Palanche; Armin Schultz; Sybille Baumann; Azita J Mahiny; Gabor Boros; Jonas Reinholz; Gabor T Szabo; Katalin Kariko; Pei-Yong Shi; Camila Fontes-Garfias; John L Perez; Mark Cutler; David Cooper; Christos A Kyratsous; Philip R Dormitzer; Kathrin U Jansen; Oezlem Tuereci,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20245175,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20245175,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
487,Effect of clustering and correlation of belief systems on infectious disease outbreaks,"Contact between people with similar opinions and characteristics occurs at a higher rate than among other people, a phenomenon known as homophily. The presence of clusters of unvaccinated people has been associated with increased incidence of infectious disease outbreaks despite high vaccination coverage. The epidemiological consequences of homophily regarding other beliefs and correlations among belief systems are however poorly understood. Here, we use a simple compartmental disease model as well as a more complex COVID-19 model to study how homophily and correlation of belief systems in a social interaction network affect the probability of disease outbreak and COVID-19-related mortality. We find that the current social context, characterized by the presence of homophily and correlations between who vaccinates, who engages in risk reduction, and individual risk status, corresponds to a situation with substantially worse disease burden than in the absence of heterogeneities. In the presence of an effective vaccine, relative effects of homophily and correlation of belief systems become stronger. Further, the optimal vaccination strategy depends on the degree of homophily regarding vaccination status as well as the relative level of risk mitigation high- and low-risk individuals practice. The developed methods are broadly applicable to any investigation in which node attributes in a graph might reasonably be expected to cluster or exhibit correlations.",Claus Kadelka; Audrey McCombs,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246298,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246298,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

489,Characterizing superspreading of SARS-CoV-2: from mechanism to measurement,"Superspreading is a ubiquitous feature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, with a few primary infectors leading to a large proportion of secondary infections. Despite the superspreading events observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks, the mechanisms behind the phenomenon are still poorly understood. Here, we show that superspreading is largely driven by heterogeneity in contact behavior rather than heterogeneity in susceptibility or infectivity caused by biological factors. We find that highly heterogeneous contact behavior is required to produce the extreme superspreading estimated from recent COVID-19 outbreaks. However, we show that superspreading estimates are noisy and subject to biases in data collection and public health capacity, potentially leading to an overestimation of superspreading. These results suggest that superspreading for COVID-19 is substantial, but less than previously estimated.

It is important to investigate the transmission dynamic of COVID-19 to help understand the impact of the disease on public health and economy. While a number of epidemic models have been available to study infectious diseases, they are in-adequate to describe the dynamic of COVID-19. In this paper, we develop a new epidemic model which utilizes a set of ordinary differential equations with unknown parameters to delineate the transmission process of COVID-19. Different from the traditional epidemic models, this model accounts for asymptomatic infections as well the lag between symptoms onset and the confirmation date of infection. We describe an estimation procedure for the unknown parameters in the proposed model by adapting the iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm to the reported number of confirmed cases. To assess the performance of our proposed model, we examine COVID-19 data in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 and carry out sensitivity studies under a variety of assumptions. To reflect the transmission potential of an infected case, we derive the basic reproduction number from the proposed model.

We developed and applied an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the UK and the US towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to understand public attitude and identify topics of concern.

MethodsOver 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1st March - 22nd November 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.

ResultsWe found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.

ConclusionsAI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude.

494,Through The Back Door: Expiratory Accumulation of SARS-Cov-2 in the Olfactory Mucosa as Mechanism for CNS Penetration,"IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus supposed to enter the organism through aerosol or fomite transmission to the nose, eyes and oropharynx. It is responsible for various clinical symptoms, including hyposmia and other neurological ones. Current literature suggests the olfactory mucosa as a port of entry to the CNS, but how the virus reaches the olfactory groove is still unknown. Because the first neurological symptoms of invasion (hyposmia) do not correspond to first signs of infection, the hypothesis of direct contact through airborne droplets during primary infection and therefore during inspiration is not plausible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if a secondary spread to the olfactory groove in a retrograde manner during expiration could be more probable.

MethodsFour three-dimensional virtual models were obtained from real CT scans and used to simulate expiratory droplets. The volume mesh consists of 25 million of cells, the simulated condition is a steady expiration, driving a flow rate of 270 ml/s, for a duration of 0.6 seconds. Droplet diameter is of 5 m.

ResultsThe analysis of the simulations shows the virus to have a high probability to be deployed in the rhinopharynx, on the tail of medium and upper turbinates. The possibility for droplets to access the olfactory mucosa during the expiratory phase is lower than other nasal areas, but consistent.

DiscussionThe data obtained from these simulations demonstrates that virus can be deployed in the olfactory groove during expiration. Even if the total amount in a single act is very low, it must be considered that it is repeated tens of thousands of times a day, and the source of contamination continuously acts on a timescale of several days. The present results also imply CNS penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through olfactory mucosa might be considered a complication and, consequently, prevention strategies should be considered in diseased patients.",Maurizio Quadrio; Carlotta Pipolo; Antonio Mario Bulfamante; Andrea Schillaci; Jacopo Banchetti; Luca Castellani; Alberto Maria Saibene; Giovanni Felisati,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20242396,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20242396,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

We used (pre)admission screening results from the major Antwerp hospitals for estimating community prevalences and incidences. 43.545 samples were included (April - November 2020). High SARS-CoV-2 carriership rates (mean week prevalence of 1.3%) were found in the general Antwerp population. 35.4% of positive cases carried high viral loads. Only a small proportion (15.3%) of the viral circulation was detected by the nationally implemented testing policy.

496,SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in renal transplant and haemodialysis patients treated with convalescent plasma,"BackgroundWhen patients with chronic kidney disease are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) they can face two specific problems: Virus-specific immune responses may be impaired and remdesivir, an antiviral drug described to shorten the time to recovery, is contraindicated. Antiviral treatment with convalescent plasma could be an alternative treatment option.

MethodsIn this case series we present two kidney transplant recipients and two patients dependent on haemodialysis who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received convalescent plasma. Antibodies against the spike 1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 were determined sequentially by IgG ELISA and neutralization assay and specific T cell responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot.

ResultsPrior to treatment, in three patients antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers ([&le;] 1:40). One patient was also negative to the ELISpot and two showed weak responses. After convalescent plasma treatment we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific T cell responses. After intermittent clinical improvement one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms at day 12 after treatment and received a second cycle of convalescent plasma treatment. Altogether, three patients clinically improved and could be discharged from hospital. However, one multimorbid female in her early eighties deceased.

497,COVID-19 Test Strategy to Guide Quarantine Interval in University Students,"BACKGROUNDFollowing COVID-19 exposure, the CDC recommends a 10-14 day quarantine for asymptomatic individuals and more recently a 7 day quarantine with a negative PCR test. We performed a university-based prospective student cohort study to determine if early PCR negativity predicts day 14 negativity.

METHODSWe enrolled 101 asymptomatic, quarantining, students, performed nasopharyngeal swabs for viral testing on days 3 or 4, 5, 7, 10 and 14 and determined the proportion of concordant negative results for each day versus day 14 with a two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval.

RESULTSOverall, 14 of 90 (16%, 95% CI: 9% - 25%) tested positive while in quarantine, with 7 initial positive tests on day 3 or 4, 5 on day 5, 2 on day 7, and none on day 10 or 14. Rates of concordant negative test results are: day 5 vs. day 14 = 45/50 (90%, 95% CI: 78% - 97%); day 7 vs. day 14 = 47/52 (90%, 95% CI: 79% - 97%); day 10 vs. day 14 = 48/53 (91%, 95% CI:79% - 97%), with no evidence of different negative rates between earlier days and day 14 by McNemars test, p > 0.05.

CONCLUSIONSThe 16% positive rate supports the ongoing need to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases, but this prospective study provides the first direct evidence that exposed asymptomatic students ages 18-44 years in a university setting are at low risk if released from quarantine at 7 days if they test negative PCR test prior to release.",Jill M Kolesar; Tyler Gayheart; Lance Poston; Eric Monday; Derek Forster; Elizabeth Belcher; Rani Jaiswal; J.

499,Clinical characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19,"ObjectiveDescribe the clinical and respiratory characteristics of critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

DesignObservational and retrospective study over 6 months.

SettingIntensive care unit (ICU) of a high complexity hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

PatientsPatients older than 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study.

Variables of interestDemographic characteristics such as sex and age, comorbidities, laboratory results, imaging results, ventilatory mechanics data, complications, and mortality were recorded.

ResultsA total of 168 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. 66% were men with a median age of 65 years (58-75. 79.7% had at least one comorbidity. The most frequent comorbidity was arterial hypertension, affecting 52.4% of the patients. 67.9 % required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), and no patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation. Most of the patients in MV (73.7%) required neuromuscular blockade due to severe hypoxemia. 36% of patients were ventilated in the prone position. The length of stay in the ICU was 13 days (6-24) and the mortality in the ICU was 25%.

500,Assessing the Performance of COVID-19 Forecasting Models in the U.S.,"Dozens of coronavirus (COVID-19) forecasting models have been created; however, little information exists on their performance. Here we examine the performance of nine commonly-used COVID-19 forecasting models, as well as equal- and performance-weighted ensembles, based on their knowledge - i.e., accuracy and precision, and their  self-knowledge - i.e.,  calibration and  information. Calibration and information are measures commonly employed in structured expert judgment to assess an experts ability to meaningfully communicate the extent and limits of their knowledge.1 Data on observed COVID-19 mortality in 4 states, selected to reflect differences in racial composition and COVID-19 case rates, over eight weeks in the summer of 2020 provided the basis for evaluating model predictions.

Only two models showed little bias (geometric mean of observed/predicted < 10%) and good precision (geometric standard deviation of observed/predicted < 1.6). Three models demonstrated good calibration and information. However, only one model exhibited superior performance in both dimensions.

Nearly all models under-predicted COVID-19 mortality, some quite substantially. Further, model performance depends on racial composition and case rates, and forecasts in the short-term outperform forecasts in the medium-term on all criteria. The performance-weighted ensembles also outperformed the equal-weighted ensemble on all criteria.

The ability of models to accurately and precisely predict mortality and the ability of the modelers to provide meaningful characterizations of the uncertainty in their estimates are potentially important to model developers and to those using model output to inform decisions.",Kyle J.

501,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 hospitalised patients in Switzerland: a prospective cohort profile,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the world causing several million victims in 213 countries. Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43000 confirmed cases as of September 1st, 2020.

AimIn cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in addition to their mandatory reporting system.

MethodsPatients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive PCR test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data collection follows a custom Case Report Form based on WHO recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms started more than 5 days after the patients admission date.

ResultsAs of September 1st, 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168 - 59.5%),and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 - 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (IQR 54-79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported: hypertension (1481 - 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5%), and diabetes (660 - 27.5%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4 -21.1%), haematological and oncological diseases (3 - 15.8%) being the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%) episodes, mostly for respiratory diseases (2470 - 93.2% in adults, 16 - 55.2% in children), renal (681 - 25.7%) and cardiac (631 - 23.8%) complication for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7 - 24.1%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989 - 76.1%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8%) episodes. 527 (14.5%) deaths were registered, all among adults.

ConclusionThe surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a very representative set of data for Switzerland. We therefore consider it to be a valuable addition to the existing mandatory reporting, providing more precise information on the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical course of these cases.",Amaury Thiabaud; Anne Iten; Carlo Balmelli; Laurence Senn; Nicolas Troillet; Andreas Widmer; Domenica Flury; Peter W.

502,Risk of adverse outcomes with COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland,"AimsTo compare the risk of adverse outcomes (i.e. hospital/intensive care admission, death) in population sub-groups during two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland.

MethodsWe analysed routinely-collected, publicly-available data on 67,900 people with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection between 29th Feb to 14th Nov 2020. This period encompassed two waves of infection and two corresponding national lockdowns. For two observational periods covering each wave (W1, W2), each ending 17-19 days before implementation of high-level national restrictions, we segmented the population based on age and underlying clinical conditions.

ResultsThe prevalence of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was 1.4%. The risk of admission to hospital, admission to intensive care, and death was 7.2%, 0.9%, and 2.5%, respectively. Compared to younger confirmed cases, those aged [&ge;]65 y had increased risk of hospital admission (RR 5.61), ICU admission (RR 3.56), and death (RR 60.8). W2 was associated with more cases and fewer adverse events than W1. The risk of all adverse outcomes was reduced in W2 than in W1.

ConclusionsOngoing responses should consider the variation in risk of adverse outcomes between specific sub-groups.

503,Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses pre- and post- COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure: an observational case-control study,"OBJECTIVESTo investigate if COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure will increase plasma levels of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody titers while improving survival and clinical outcomes.

DESIGNObservational, retrospective, control study of anti-Receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM titers from serial plasma samples drawn before and after CCP administration. Clinical improvement in CCP recipients is assessed and compared to COVID-19 control patients.

SETTINGPatients hospitalized with severe COVID19, United States, between April 17 and July 19, 2020

PARTICIPANTS34 patients hospitalized with severe or life threatening COVID-19 and who consented and received a CCP transfusion, 95 control patients with COVID-19 not transfused with CCP. 34 out the 95 control patients were matched for age, sex, and the level of respiratory support required. Patients less than 18 years old were excluded.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESSerial trends of anti-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM titers in CCP recipients are compared to those in control patients. The primary outcome is survival at 30 days, and the secondary outcomes are length of ventilatory and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, and LOS in the ICU.

RESULTSCCP transfusion occurred in 34 patients at a median of 12 days following COVID-19 symptom onset. Immediately prior to CCP transfusion, patients median anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM titers were 1:3200 (IQR, 1:50 to 1:9600) and 1:320 (IQR, 1:40 to 1:640) respectively. Following a Loess regression analysis, the kinetics and distribution of anti-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in plasma from CCP recipients were comparable to those from a control group of 68 patients who did not receive CCP. CCP recipients presented with similar survival, similar duration on ventilatory and/or ECMO support, as well as ICU and hospital LOS, compared to a matched control group of 34 patients.

CONCLUSIONIn the present study, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure transfused with CCP presented with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies before transfusion and did not show improved survival at 30 days.",Matthew N.

First, the CT image pictures are preprocessed, and the pictures are converted into the picture formats which are required for transfer learning. Secondly, perform small-sample image enhancement and expansion on the converted picture, such as miscut transformation, random rotation and translation, etc.. Then, multiple migration models are used to extract features and then perform feature fusion. Finally,the model is adjusted by fine-tuning.Then train the model to obtain experimental results.

505,Impact of Nasopharyngeal Specimen Quality on SARS-CoV-2 Test Performance,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle of threshold (Ct) has been used to estimate quantitative viral load, with the goal of targeting isolation precautions for individuals with COVID-19 and guiding public health interventions. However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity.

MethodsWe performed amplification of a human gene target ({beta}-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1311 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by high Ct values for the human gene target {beta}-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-actin Ct.

ResultsLow quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI 0.523 to 0.802). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-actin Ct values (slope 0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with {beta}-actin Ct values.

ConclusionsVariability in NP specimen quality accounts for significant differences in the sensitivity of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays. If unrecognized, low quality NP specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.",Melissa Richard-Greenblatt; Matthew J Ziegler; Valerie Bromberg; Elizabeth Huang; Hatem O Abdallah; Pam Tolomeo; Ebbing Lautenbach; Laurel Glaser; Brendan J Kelly,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246520,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246520,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
506,COVID-19 vaccine confidence and hesitancy among healthcare workers: a cross-sectional survey from a MERS-CoV experienced nation,"ObjectivesThis study aimed to identify COVID-19 vaccine perception, acceptance, confidence, hesitancy, and barriers among healthcare workers (HCW).

MethodsAn online national cross-sectional pilot-validated questionnaire was self-administered by HCW in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience. The main outcome variable was HCWs acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and the level of anxiety using generalized anxiety disorder 7.

ResultOut of 1512 HCWs who completed the study questionnaire--944 (62.4%) women and 568 (37.6%) men--1058 (70%) were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis revealed that male HCWs (ORa=1.551, 95% CI: 1.122-2.144), HCWs who believe in vaccine safety (ORa=2.151; 95% CI:1.708-2.708), HCWs who believe that COVID vaccines are the most likely way to stop the pandemic (ORa=1.539; 95% CI: 1.259-1.881), and HCWs who rely on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for COVID 19 updates (ORa=1.505, 95% CI: 1.125-2.013) were significantly associated with reporting willingness to be vaccinated. However, HCWs who believed vaccines were rushed without evidence-informed testing were found to be 60% less inclined to accept COVID-19 vaccines (ORa=0.394, 95% CI: 0.298- 0.522).

ConclusionMost HCWs are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines once available; yet, satisfactoriness of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs is crucial because health professionals knowledge and confidence toward vaccines are important determining factors for their own vaccine acceptance and recommendation to their patients.",Mazin Barry; Mohamad-Hani Temsah; Abdullah Alhuzaimi; Nurah Alamro; Ayman Al-Eyadhy; Fadi Aljamaan; Basema Saddik; Ali Alhaboob; Fahad Alsohime; Khalid Alhasan; Abdulkarim Alrabiaah; Ali Alaraj; Rabih Halwani; Amr Jamal; Sarah Alsubaie; Fatimah Saad Al-Shahrani; Ziad Memish; Jaffar Al-Tawfiq,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246447,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
507,"Risk factors for retirement home COVID-19 outbreaks in Ontario, Canada: A population-level cohort study","BackgroundThe epidemiology of COVID-19 in retirement homes (also known as assisted living facilities) is largely unknown. We examined the association between retirement home and community level characteristics and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in retirement homes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from March 1st - September 24th, 2020. Our primary outcome was a COVID-19 outbreak ([&ge;]1 resident or staff confirmed case by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home and community level characteristics and COVID-19 outbreaks.

ResultsOur cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56,491 residents. There were 172 (22.3%) COVID-19 retirement home outbreaks involving 1,045 (1.9%) residents and 548 staff (1.5%). COVID-19 cases were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) of homes. The adjusted hazard of a COVID-19 outbreak in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a long-term care facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, increases in regional COVID-19 incidence, and a higher community-level ethnic concentration.

InterpretationReadily identifiable retirement home-level characteristics are independently associated with COVID-19 outbreaks and may support risk identification.

508,Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation for prevention of COVID-19 mortality: a nationwide cohort study of hospitalized patients in the United States,"ImportanceDeaths among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are partially attributed to venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboses. Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis formation, possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and may be particularly effective for treating patients with COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo evaluate whether initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission is associated with decreased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingNationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.

ParticipantsAll patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection March 1 to July 31, 2020, without a history of therapeutic anticoagulation.

ExposuresProphylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or direct oral anticoagulants.

Main Outcomes and Measures30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation.

ResultsOf 4,297 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 3,627 (84.4%) received prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99% (n=3,600) received subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin. We observed 622 deaths within 30 days of admission, 513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82%) occurred during hospitalization. In inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% CI 13.1-15.5) among those receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7% (95% CI 15.1-22.9) among those who did not. Compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27% decreased risk for 30-day mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Quantitative bias analysis demonstrated that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95% CI 1.77). Results persisted in a number of sensitivity analyses.

509,Conundrum of re-positives COVID-19 cases: A Systematic review of Case reports and Case series,"IntroductionThere have been case reports and case series published for RT PCR positive COVID - 19 cases that became RT PCR negative but subsequently became RT PCR positive after a symptom free interval following a negative RT PCR test. These cases may include re-positive, reactivated and re-infection cases. Hence, the systematic review to summarize and synthesize evidence from all available case series and case reports published was undertaken.

MethodologyThe systematic review of case series and case reports was registered with Prospero with registration number CRD42020210446. PRISMA guidelines were followed for conducting the systematic review. Studies published in English language only were considered for the Systematic Review. Inclusion criteria for studies included case reports and case series which have documented cases of positive RT-PCR after a period of improvement or negative RT PCR. Reviews, opinions and animal studies were excluded. Case reports which described clinical presentation or manifestations of COVID-19 cases were also excluded from the studies. Methodological quality was assessed using modified Murad scale.

ResultsA total of 30 case reports/case series were included in the study, wherein a total of 219 cases were included. In re-positive cases, the age range varied from 10 months to 91 years. The pooled proportion using random effects was 12% with 95% CI from 09% to 15%. Among the re-positives, a total of 57 cases (26%) of the cases had co-morbidities. A total of 51 (23.3%) and 17 (7.8%) re-positive cases had been treated with antivirals and corticosteroids respectively. Among the symptomatic cases, the disease severity was lesser as compared to the initial episode of illness. Only a few studies have confirmed the presence of antibodies after the first episode. The few studies that had done contact tracing of re-positives did not find any positive cases among those in contact with re-positives.

ConclusionThis systematic review presents the review of all the case reports and case series on recurrence of COVID 19 disease. Although limited evidence has been generated due to paucity of such studies and shortcomings in the study designs of case reports and case-series, nonetheless, the evidence generated can still be used in making clinical decisions and framing policy guidelines",Arun K Yadav; Subhadeep Ghosh; Sudhir Dubey,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20223990,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20223990,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
