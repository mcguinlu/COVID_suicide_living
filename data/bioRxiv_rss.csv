0,Dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate and transcribe its genome. Structures of the RdRp revealed a monomeric enzyme composed of the catalytic subunit nsp12, two copies of subunit nsp8, and one copy of subunit nsp7. Here we report an alternative, dimeric form of the coronavirus polymerase and resolve its structure at 4.8 [A] resolution. In this structure, the two RdRps contain only one copy of nsp8 and dimerize via their nsp7 subunits to adopt an antiparallel arrangement. We speculate that the RdRp dimer facilitates template switching during production of sub-genomic RNAs for transcription.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436644,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436644,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,False
1,"Addressing disruptions in childhood routine immunisation services during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives and lessons learned from Liberia, Nepal, and Senegal","The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted multifaceted disruptions to routine immunisation from global to local levels, affecting every aspect of vaccine supply, access, and demand. Since March 2020, country programmes have implemented a range of strategies to either continue vaccination services during COVID-19 measures like 'lockdown' and/or resume services when risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be appropriately mitigated. Through the Exemplars in Global Health partnership in Liberia, Nepal, and Senegal, we conducted interviews with immunisation programme managers and ministry of health leadership to better understand how they have addressed the myriad vaccination challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. From establishing alternative modes of service delivery to combatting vaccine distrust and rumours via risk communication campaigns, many routine immunisation programmes have demonstrated how to adapt, resume, and/or maintain vital vaccination efforts during the COVID-19 crisis. Yet millions of children remain un- or under-vaccinated worldwide, and the same programmes striving to implement catch-up services for missed doses and postponed mass campaigns will also soon be tasked with COVID-19 vaccine deployment. As laid bare by the current pandemic, the world's gains against vaccine-preventable diseases are fragile: enshrined by a delicate global ecosystem of logistics, supply, and procurement, the success of routine immunisation ultimately rests upon dedicated programme staff, the resources and support available to them, and then the trust in and demand for vaccines by their recipients. Our collective lessons learned during COVID-19 offer insights in programme adaptation and resilience that, if prioritised, could strengthen equitable, sustainable vaccine delivery for all populations.",Sameer M Dixit; Moussa Sarr; Daouda M Gueye; Kyle Muther; T Ruston Yarnko; Robert A Bednarczyk; Adolphus T Clarke; Aliou Diallo; Bonheur Dounebaine; Anna Ellis; Nancy Fullman; Nathaniel Gerthe; Jhalak S Guatam; Kyra Hester; Gloria Ikilezi; Souleymane Mboup; Rajesh Man Rajbhandari; David E Phillips; Matthew C Freeman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21252686,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21252686,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
2,Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake in an elderly sample in Poland,"Backgrounds: This research represents an investigation into potential predictors for the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination in Poland, following the instigation of policies to encourage the over-seventies to be vaccinated. Methods: Individuals participated in cross-sectional structured interviews. 1427 respondents were questioned for determining vaccination uptake, revealing attitudes regarding vaccination, where information was sourced from, health status and behavior, demographics and socio-economic profiles. Results: Selected predictors for acceptance of the vaccination were: being talked through the importance of the vaccination and potential side-effects by a medical professional; sharing living space with others; having a high ranking occupation; suffering from chronic illnesses; being able to access medical services by driving or walking rather than using public transport or relying on others. Those who opted not to be vaccinated most frequently justify their decision by saying that they were concerned about the efficacy of the vaccine or that they were worried about side-effects. Conclusions: It appears that the current nationwide campaign has successfully raised awareness regarding the vaccine, but this research indicates that a more information-based campaign, focusing on evidence of the vaccine's efficacy and the non-serious nature of all side-effects, could lead to improved uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.",Marta Malesza; Magdalena Bozym,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254047,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254047,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
3,Determinants of COVID-19 outcomes: A systematic review.,"Background: The current pandemic, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has claimed over a million lives worldwide in a year, warranting the need for more research into the wider determinants of COVID-19 outcomes to support evidence-based policies. Objective: This study aimed to investigate what factors determined the mortality and length of hospitalisation in individuals with COVID-19. Data Source: This is a systematic review with data from four electronic databases: Scopus, Google Scholar, CINAHL and Web of Science. Eligibility Criteria: Studies were included in this review if they explored determinants of COVID-19 mortality or length of hospitalisation, were written in the English Language, and had available full-text. Study appraisal and data synthesis: The authors assessed the quality of the included studies with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist, depending on their study design. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was carried out. Results: The review included 22 studies from nine countries, with participants totalling 239,830. The included studies quality was moderate to high. The identified determinants were categorised into demographic, biological, socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors, based on the Dahlgren and Whitehead determinant of health model. Increasing age (ORs 1.04-20.6, 95%CIs 1.01-22.68) was the common demographic determinant of COVID-19 mortality while living with diabetes (ORs 0.50-3.2, 95%CIs -0.2-0.74) was one of the most common biological determinants of COVID-19 length of hospitalisation. Review limitation: Meta-analysis was not conducted because of included studies heterogeneity. Conclusion: COVID-19 outcomes are predicted by multiple determinants, with increasing age and living with diabetes being the most common risk factors. Population-level policies that prioritise interventions for the elderly population and the people living with diabetes may help mitigate the outbreak's impact.",Shirley Crankson; Subhash Pokhrel; Nana Kwame Anokye,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254068,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254068,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
4,Corticosteroids and mortality in patients with severe Covid-19 who have autoantibodies,"Auto-reactivity in COVID-19 is increasingly being recognized and may identify a group of patients with inflammation severe enough to result in loss of self-tolerance. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents and now the standard of care for patients with severe Covid-19 requiring oxygen support/mechanical ventilation. We studied the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who demonstrated clinically identifiable auto-reactivity and received corticosteroid treatment. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 51 COVID-19 patients admitted between March 10, 2020 and May 2, 2020 who received corticosteroid treatment and also had serum sample in our institution bio-bank available for ANA and RF ELISA. Twelve patients (23.5%) had positive ANA or RF. Mortality rate among patients with positive autoantibodies was significantly higher than those without (9/12 or 75% versus 13/39 or 33.3%, p= 0.02). The high mortality rate in patients with auto-reactivity warrants further investigation and may be the subgroup where additional immunomodulation is effective.",Zhu Cui; Maxwell Roth; Yelena Averbukh; Andrei Assa; Azal Al-ani; William Southern; Morayma Reyes Gill; Shitij Arora,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253005,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253005,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
5,In-person schooling and COVID-19 transmission in Canada's three largest cities,"In North America and Europe, the Fall 2020 school term has coincided with the beginning of the second wave of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, sparking a heated debate about the role of in-person schooling for community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This issue has immediate policy relevance for deciding how to operate schools safely as the pandemic unfolds, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating, and immunization coverage remains low. We contribute to this debate by presenting data on trends in COVID-19 weekly incidence among school-aged children 0-19 years old vis-a-vis other age groups during Fall 2020 in Canada's three largest cities: Montreal, Toronto and Calgary. We interpret these trends in light of the different back-to-school policies and other public health measures implemented in the three cities over the observation period.",Simona Bignami; Yacine Boujija; David Fisman; John Sandberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254064,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254064,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
6,"Long Covid in adults discharged from UK hospitals after Covid-19: A prospective, multicentre cohort study using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol.","Structured Abstract Objectives: The long-term consequences of severe Covid-19 requiring hospital admission are not well characterised. The objective of this study was to establish the long-term effects of Covid-19 following hospitalisation and the impact these may have on patient reported outcome measures. Design: A multicentre, prospective cohort study with at least 3 months follow-up of participants admitted to hospital between 5th February 2020 and 5th October 2020. Setting: 31 hospitals in the United Kingdom. Participants: 327 hospitalised participants discharged alive from hospital with confirmed/high likelihood SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcome measures and comparisons: The primary outcome was self-reported recovery at least ninety days after initial Covid-19 symptom onset. Secondary outcomes included new symptoms, new or increased disability (Washington group short scale), breathlessness (MRC Dyspnoea scale) and quality of life (EQ5D-5L). We compared these outcome measures across age, comorbidity status and in-hospital Covid-19 severity to identify groups at highest risk of developing long-term difficulties. Multilevel logistic and linear regression models were built to adjust for the effects of patient and centre level risk factors on these outcomes. Results: In total 53.7% (443/824) contacted participants responded, yielding 73.8% (327/443) responses with follow-up of 90 days or more from symptom onset. The median time between symptom onset of initial illness and completing the participant questionnaire was 222 days (Interquartile range (IQR) 189 to 269 days). In total, 54.7% (179/327) of participants reported they did not feel fully recovered. Persistent symptoms were reported by 93.3% (305/325) of participants, with fatigue the most common (82.8%, 255/308), followed by breathlessness (53.5%, 175/327). 46.8% (153/327) reported an increase in MRC dyspnoea scale of at least one grade. New or worse disability was reported by 24.2% (79/327) of participants. Overall (EQ5D-5L) summary index was significantly worse at the time of follow-up (median difference 0.1 points on a scale of 0 to 1, IQR: -0.2 to 0.0). Females under the age of 50 years were five times less likely to report feeling recovered (adjusted OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.64 to 15.74), were more likely to have greater disability (adjusted OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.94), twice as likely to report worse fatigue (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31) and seven times more likely to become more breathless (adjusted OR 7.15, 95% CI 2.24 to 22.83) than men of the same age. Conclusions: Survivors of Covid-19 experienced long-term symptoms, new disability, increased breathlessness, and reduced quality of life. These findings were present even in young, previously healthy working age adults, and were most common in younger females. Policymakers should fund further research to identify effective treatments for long-Covid and ensure healthcare, social care and welfare support is available for individuals with long-Covid.",Louise Sigfrid; Tom M Drake; Ellen Pauley; Edwin C Jesudason; Piero Olliaro; Wei Shen Lim; Annelise Gillesen; Colin Berry; David Lowe; Joanne McPeake; Nazir Lone; Daniel Munblit; Anna Casey; Peter Bannister; Clark D Russell; Lynsey Goodwin; Antonia Ho; Lance Turtle; Margret E O'Hara; Claire Hastie; Chloe Donohue; Rebecca Spencer; Cara Donegan; Alison Gummery; Janet Harrison; Hayley Hardwick; Claire E Hastie; Gail Carson; Laura Merson; John Kenneth Baillie; Peter Openshaw; Ewen M Harrison; Annemarie Docherty; Malcolm G Semple; Janet T Scott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253888,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253888,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
7,Detection of Mutations Associated with Variants of Concern Via High Throughput Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Isolated from NYC Wastewater,"Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is strongly indicated because diversifying selection may lead to the emergence of novel variants resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity. To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community. Here we describe a safe, affordable protocol for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. Our targeted sequencing approach revealed the presence of mutations associated with several Variants of Concern at appreciable frequencies. Our work demonstrates that wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing can inform surveillance efforts monitoring the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and detect the appearance of novel emerging variants more cheaply, safely, and efficiently than the sequencing of individual clinical samples.",Davida S Smyth; Monica Trujillo; Kristen Cheung; Anna Gao; Irene Hoxie; Sherin Kannoly; Nanami Kubota; Michelle Markman; Kaungmyat San; Geena Sompanya; John J Dennehy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253978,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253978,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
8,Age-related changes in the upper respiratory microbiome are associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and illness severity,"Children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and typically have milder illness courses than adults. We studied the nasopharyngeal microbiomes of 274 children, adolescents, and young adults with SARS-CoV-2 exposure using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We find that higher abundances of Corynebacterium species are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory symptoms, while higher abundances of Dolosigranulum pigrum are present in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals without respiratory symptoms. We also demonstrate that the abundances of these bacteria are strongly, and independently, associated with age, suggesting that the nasopharyngeal microbiome may be a potentially modifiable mechanism by which age influences SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity.",Jillian H.

9,Antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs reduce viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 and fluoxetine show antiviral activity against the novel variants in vitro,"Background and Purpose: Repurposing of currently available drugs is a valuable strategy to tackle the consequences of COVID-19. Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Experimental Approach: Several antidepressant drugs and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Key Results: Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudo viruses with N501Y, K417N, and E484K spike mutations, and the VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion and Implications: Our study confirms previous data and extends information on the repurposing of these drugs to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection including different variants of concern.",Merve Senem Fred; Suvi Kuivanen; Hasan Ugurlu; Plinio Cabrera Casarotto; Lev Levanov; Kalle Saksela; Olli Vapalahti; Eero Castren,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436379,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436379,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
10,The Prolyl-tRNA Synthetase Inhibitor Halofuginone Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"We identify the prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) inhibitor halofuginone, a compound in clinical trials for anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory applications, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) promotes viral entry. We find that halofuginone reduces HS biosynthesis, thereby reducing spike protein binding, SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Halofuginone also potently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication post-entry. Utilizing analogues of halofuginone and small molecule inhibitors of the PRS, we establish that inhibition of HS presentation and viral replication is dependent on proline tRNA synthesis opposed to PRS activation of the integrated stress response (ISR). Moreover, we provide evidence that these effects are mediated by the depletion of proline tRNAs. In line with this, we find that SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins, as well as several HS proteoglycans, are particularly proline-rich, which may make them vulnerable to halofuginone translational suppression. Halofuginone is orally bioavailable, has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in humans and distributes to SARS-CoV-2 target organs, including the lung, making it a promising clinical trial candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.",Daniel R.

Patients reported no travel history and shared no obvious epidemiological linkage. A search of online databases identified 12 additional B.1.1.220 with E484K, all of which were detected in New York since December 2020.

12,Protein-primed RNA synthesis in SARS-CoVs and structural basis for inhibition by AT-527,"How viruses from the Coronaviridae family initiate viral RNA synthesis is unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain on nsp12 uridylates the viral cofactor nsp8, forming a UMP-Nsp8 covalent intermediate that subsequently primes RNA synthesis from a poly(A) template; a protein-priming mechanism reminiscent of Picornaviridae enzymes. In parallel, the RdRp active site of nsp12 synthesizes a pppGpU primer, which primes (-)ssRNA synthesis at the precise genome-poly(A) junction. The guanosine analogue 5'-triphosphate AT-9010 (prodrug: AT-527) tightly binds to the NiRAN and inhibits both nsp8-labeling and the initiation of RNA synthesis. A 2.98 A resolution Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8)2 /RNA/NTP quaternary complex shows AT-9010 simultaneously binds to both NiRAN and RdRp active site of nsp12, blocking their respective activities.

13,The Dual-Antigen Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine Delivered as an Intranasal Plus Subcutaneous Prime Elicits Th1 Dominant T-Cell and Humoral Responses in CD-1 Mice,"In response to the need for an efficacious, thermally-stable COVID-19 vaccine that can elicit both humoral and cell-mediated T-cell responses, we have developed a dual-antigen human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) COVID-19 vaccine in formulations suitable for subcutaneous (SC), intranasal (IN), or oral delivery. The vaccine expresses both the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins using an hAd5 platform with E1, E2b, and E3 sequences deleted; hAd5(E1-, E2b-, E3-); that is effective even in the presence of hAd5 immunity. In the vaccine, S is modified (S-Fusion) for enhanced cell surface display to elicit humoral responses and N is modified with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) to direct N to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway to increase MHC I and II presentation. Initial studies using subcutaneous (SC) prime and SC boost vaccination of CD-1 mice demonstrated that the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine elicits T-helper cell 1 (Th1) dominant T-cell and humoral responses to both S and N. We then compared SC to IN prime vaccination with either an SC or IN boost post-SC prime and an IN boost after IN prime. These studies reveal that IN prime/IN boost is as effective at generating Th1 dominant humoral responses to both S and N as the other combinations, but that the SC prime with either an IN or SC boost elicits greater T cell responses. In a third study to assess the power of the two routes of delivery when used together, we used a combined SC plus IN prime with or without a boost and found the combined prime alone to be as effective as the combined prime with either an SC or IN boost in generating both humoral and T-cell responses. The findings here in CD-1 mice demonstrate that combined SC and IN prime-only delivery has the potential to provide broad immunity, including mucosal immunity, against SARS-CoV-2 and supports further testing of this delivery approach in additional animal models and clinical trials.",Adrian Rice; Mohit Verma; Annie Shin; Lise Zakin; Peter Sieling; Shiho Tanaka; Joseph Balint; Kyle Dinkins; Helty Adisetiyo; Brett Morimoto; Justin Taft; Roosheel Sandeep Patel; Sofija Buta; Marta Martin-Fernandez; Dusan Bogunovic; Patricia R Spilman; Elizabeth R Gabitzsch; Jeffrey T Safrit; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Kayvan Niazi; Patrick Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436476,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436476,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
14,Characterization and functional interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a devastating global health crisis. The emergence of highly transmissible novel viral strains that escape neutralizing responses emphasizes the urgent need to deepen our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and to develop additional therapeutic strategies. Using a comprehensive identification of RNA binding proteins (RBP) by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-M/S) approach, we identified 142 high-confidence cellular factors that bind the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome during infection. By systematically knocking down their expression in a human lung epithelial cell line, we found that the majority of the RBPs identified in our study are proviral factors that regulate SARS-CoV-2 genome replication. We showed that some of these proteins represented drug targets of interest for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive view of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome during infection and highlights candidates for host-centered antiviral therapies.",Athena Labeau; Alain Lefevre-Utile; Lucie Bonnet-Madin; Luc Fery-Simonian; Vassili Soumelis; Vincent Lotteau; Pierre-Olivier Vidalain; Ali Amara; Laurent Meertens,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436611,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436611,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
15,Dry Swab Method of sample collection for SARS-CoV2 testing can be used for culturing virus,"Background: Earlier studies suggested the use of dry swab method for SARS-CoV-2 detection as it does not need VTM and subsequent RNA extraction step making the process cheaper, safer and faster. In this study we explore whether the virus in the dry swab is viable and can be cultured and propagated. Method: Swabs were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 and stored in three different conditions: a) as dry swab (SD, eluted in 1 mL DMEM), b) in 1 mL of Viral Transport Medium (SVTM), and c) in 1 mL of Tris-EDTA buffer (STE). The sample groups were stored either at room temperature (RT ,25{degrees}C{+/-}1{degrees}C) or at 4{degrees}C for 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours before being used as viral inoculums for the propagation studies in Vero cells. Results: The RT-qPCR data suggests that SD incubated both at RT and 4{degrees}C harbors viral particles that are viable and culturable at par with SVTM and STE.

Recent studies showed reduction of neutralization against these emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants by vaccine-elicited antibodies.

In the present study, we evaluated our previously identified antibody and antibody domains for binding to these RBD variants with the emerging mutations, and neutralization of pseudo typed viruses carrying spike proteins with such mutations. Our results showed that one previously identified antibody domain, ab6, can bind 32 out of 35 RBD mutants tested in an ELISA assay. All three antibodies and antibody domains can neutralize pseudo typed B.1.1.7 (UK variant), but only the antibody domain ab6 can neutralize the pseudo typed virus with the triple mutation (K417N, E484K, N501Y). This domain and its improvements have potential for therapy of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 mutants.",Zehua Sun; Andrew Kim; Michele D Sobolewski; Nathan Enick; Chuan Chen; Cynthia Adams; Jana L Jacobs; Kevin D McCormick; John W.

17,Application of an integrated computational antibody engineering platform to design SARS-CoV-2 neutralizers,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, hundreds of new initiatives including studies on existing medicines are running to fight the disease. To deliver a potentially immediate and lasting treatment to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, new collaborations and ways of sharing are required to create as many paths forward as possible. Here we leverage our expertise in computational antibody engineering to rationally design/optimize three previously reported SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and share our proposal towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 biologics therapeutics. SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, m396, 80R, and CR-3022 were chosen as templates due to their diversified epitopes and confirmed neutralization potency against SARS. Structures of variable fragment (Fv) in complex with receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV2 were subjected to our established in silico antibody engineering platform to improve their binding affinity to SARS-CoV2 and developability profiles. The selected top mutations were ensembled into a focused library for each antibody for further screening. In addition, we convert the selected binders with different epitopes into the trispecific format, aiming to increase potency and to prevent mutational escape. Lastly, to avoid antibody induced virus activation or enhancement, we applied NNAS and DQ mutations to the Fc region to eliminate effector functions and extend half-life.",Saleh Riahi; Jae Hyeon Lee; Shuai Wei; Robert Cost; Alessandro Masiero; Catherine Prades; Reza Olfati-Saber; Maria Wendt; Anna Park; Yu Qiu; Yanfeng Zhou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436613,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436613,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
18,"Identification, crystallization and epitope determination of public TCR shared and expanded in COVID-19 patients","T cells play pivotal roles in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells mediate the production of antigen-specific antibodies; however, T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes used by SARS-CoV-2-specific Tfh cells have not been well characterized. Here, we first identified and crystallized public TCR of Tfh clonotypes that are shared and expanded in unhospitalized COVID-19-recovered patients. These clonotypes preferentially recognized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein epitopes which are conserved among emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. These clonotypes did not react with S proteins derived from common cold human coronaviruses, but cross-reacted with symbiotic bacteria, which might confer the publicity. Among SARS-CoV-2 S epitopes, S864-882, presented by frequent HLA-DR alleles, could activate multiple public Tfh clonotypes in COVID-19-recovered patients. Furthermore, S864-882-loaded HLA tetramer preferentially bound to CD4+ T cells expressing CXCR5.

19,Clonal dissection of immunodominance and cross-reactivity of the CD4+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2,"The identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes is essential for the design of effective vaccines capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies and long-term immunity. Here we demonstrate in COVID-19 patients a robust CD4+ T cell response to naturally processed SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleoprotein, including effector, helper and memory T cells. By characterizing 2,943 Spike-reactive T cell clones, we found that 34% of the clones and 93% of the patients recognized a conserved immunodominant region encompassing residues S346-365 in the RBD and comprising three nested HLA-DR and HLA-DP restricted epitopes. By using pre- and post-COVID-19 samples and Spike proteins from alpha and beta coronaviruses, we provide in vivo evidence of cross-reactive T cell responses targeting multiple sites in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The possibility of leveraging immunodominant and cross-reactive T helper epitopes is instrumental for vaccination strategies that can be rapidly adapted to counteract emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Jun Siong Low; Daniela Vaqueirinho; Federico Mele; Mathilde Foglierini; Michela Perotti; David Jarrossay; Sandra Jovic; Tatiana Terrot; Alessandra Franzetti Pellanda; Maira Biggiogero; Christian Garzoni; Paolo Ferrari; Alessandro Ceschi; Antonio Lanzavecchia; Antonino Cassotta; Federica Sallusto,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436642,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436642,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
20,The SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex is a priority target for broad-spectrum pan-coronavirus drugs,"In the absence of effective treatment, COVID-19 is likely to remain a global disease burden. Compounding this threat is the near certainty that novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential will emerge in years to come. Pan-coronavirus drugs - agents active against both SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses - would address both threats. A strategy to develop such broad-spectrum inhibitors is to pharmacologically target binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are highly conserved in other known coronaviruses, the assumption being that any selective pressure to keep a site conserved across past viruses will apply to future ones. Here, we systematically mapped druggable binding pockets on the experimental structure of fifteen SARS-CoV-2 proteins and analyzed their variation across twenty-seven - and {beta}-coronaviruses and across thousands of SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients. We find that the two most conserved druggable sites are a pocket overlapping the RNA binding site of the helicase nsp13, and the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12, both components of the viral replication-transcription complex.

21,The Impact of Early or Late Lockdowns on the Spread of COVID-19 in US Counties,"Background: COVID-19 is a highly transmissible infectious disease that has infected over 122 million individuals worldwide. To combat this pandemic, governments around the world have imposed lockdowns. However, the impact of these lockdowns on the rates of COVID-19 transmission in communities is not well known. Here, we used COVID-19 case counts from 3,000+ counties in the United States (US) to determine the relationship between lockdown as well as other county factors and the rate of COVID-19 spread in these communities. Methods: We merged county-specific COVID-19 case counts with US census data and the date of lockdown for each of the counties. We then applied a Functional Principal Component (FPC) analysis on this dataset to generate scores that described the trajectory of COVID-19 spread across the counties. We used machine learning methods to identify important factors in the county including the date of lockdown that significantly influenced the FPC scores. Findings: We found that the first FPC score accounted for up to 92.81% of the variations in the absolute rates of COVID-19 as well as the topology of COVID-19 spread over time at a county level. The relation between incidence of COVID-19 and time at a county level demonstrated a hockey-stick appearance with an inflection point approximately 7 days prior to the county reporting at least 5 new cases of COVID-19; beyond this inflection point, there was an exponential increase in incidence. Among the risk factors, lockdown and total population were the two most significant features of the county that influenced the rate of COVID-19 infection, while the median family income, median age and within-county move also substantially affect COVID spread. Interpretation: Lockdowns are an effective way of controlling the COVID-19 spread in communities. However, significant delays in lockdown cause a dramatic increase in the case counts. Thus, the timing of the lockdown relative to the case count is an important consideration in controlling the pandemic in communities.",Xiaolin Huang; Xiaojian Shao; Li Xing; Yushan Hu; Don Sin; Xuekui Zhang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253997,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253997,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
22,Mortality in individuals treated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma varies with the geographic provenance of donors,"Treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have attempted to harness the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) including the development of successful COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics (e.g., Remdesivir, convalescent plasma [CP]). Evidence that SARS-CoV-2 exists as quasispecies evolving locally suggests that immunological differences may exist that could impact the effectiveness of antibody-based treatments and vaccines. Regional variants of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in the USA beginning in November 2020 but were likely present earlier. There is available evidence that the effectiveness of CP obtained from donors infected with earlier strains in the pandemic may be reduced when tested for neutralization against newer SARS-Cov-2 variants. Using data from the Expanded Access Program to convalescent plasma, we used a gradient-boosting machine to identify predictors of 30-day morality and a series of regression models to estimate the relative risk of death at 30 days post-transfusion for those receiving near sourced plasma (defined as plasma transported [&le;] 150 miles) vs. distantly sourced plasma (> 150 miles). Our results show a lower risk of death at 30 days post-transfusion for near sourced plasma. Additional analyses stratified by disease severity, time to treatment, and donor region further supported these findings. The results of this study suggest that near sourced plasma is superior to distantly sourced plasma, which has implications for interpreting the results of clinical studies and designing effective treatment of COVID-19 patients as additional local variant are likely to emerge.",Katie L Kunze; Patrick W Johnson; Noud van Helmond; Jonathon W Senefeld; Molly M Petersen; Stephen A Klassen; Chad C Wiggins; Allan M Klompas; Katelyn A Bruno; John R Mills; Elitza S Theel; Matthew R Buras; Michael A Golafshar; Matthew A Sexton; Juan C Diaz Soto; Sarah E Baker; John R.A.

23,T-cell receptor sequencing identifies prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates with neutralizing antibody titers and disease severity,"Measuring the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can enable the assessment of past infection as well as protective immunity and the risk of reinfection. While neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are one measure of protection, such assays are challenging to perform at a large scale and the longevity of the SARS-CoV-2 nAb response is not fully understood. Here, we apply a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay that can be performed on a small volume standard blood sample to assess the adaptive T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were collected from a cohort of 302 individuals recovered from COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection. Previously published findings in this cohort showed that two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays correlate well with nAb testing. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response strongly correlates with nAb titer, as well as clinical indicators of disease severity including hospitalization, fever, or difficulty breathing. While the depth and breadth of the T-cell response declines during convalescence, the T-cell signal remains well above background with high sensitivity up to at least 6 months following initial infection. Compared to serology tests detecting binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, the overall sensitivity of the TCR-based assay across the entire cohort and all timepoints was approximately 5% greater for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the improved performance of T-cell testing compared to serology was most apparent in recovered individuals who were not hospitalized and were sampled beyond 150 days of their initial illness, suggesting that antibody testing may have reduced sensitivity in individuals who experienced less severe COVID-19 illness and at later timepoints. Finally, T-cell testing was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in 68% (55/81) of convalescent samples having nAb titers below the lower limit of detection, as well as 37% (13/35) of samples testing negative by all three antibody assays. These results demonstrate the utility of a TCR-based assay as a scalable, reliable measure of past SARS-CoV-2 infection across a spectrum of disease severity. Additionally, the TCR repertoire may be useful as a surrogate for protective immunity with additive clinical value beyond serologic or nAb testing methods.",Rebecca Elyanow; Thomas M.

24,Weekly SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic students and staff to guide and evaluate strategies for safer in-person learning,"Background: Data suggest that COVID-19 transmission in K-12 schools is uncommon, but few studies have confirmed this using widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals. Objective: To evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19, document the frequency of in-school transmission, and confirm feasibility of widespread asymptomatic screening in schools. Design: Prospective observational study Setting: Single mid-sized suburban school district including 10 schools and a central office. Participants: District staff and students Interventions: Asymptomatic screening PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Measurements: Concurrent with a hybrid model and layered mitigation, weekly pooled testing of staff and secondary students was offered using saliva samples collected at home. Identification of >1 case in a school prompted investigation for possible in-school transmission. Staff and families were surveyed about satisfaction with the screening program. Results: From weeks 1-18, rates of incident COVID-19 in the surrounding community rose steadily. Weekly staff and student screening identified 0-7 asymptomatic cases/week. In week 7, 5 cases were identified among staff who shared an office setting. Enhancements to mitigation strategies were undertaken. The proportion of survey respondents self-reporting comfort with in-person learning before versus after implementation of screening increased. Limitations: Because screening testing was not mandatory, the results from the participating population might not represent the entire school community. Conclusions: In this school district with layered mitigation measures, in-school transmission was rare. The program identified a cluster with in-school staff-to-staff transmission and spurred enhancement of safety strategies. A weekly COVID-19 screening program can provide critical data to inform mitigation efforts, and provides school-specific, current data to inform decisions about in-person learning models.

25,Older biological age is associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes: A cohort study in UK Biobank,"Background: Older chronological age is the most powerful risk factor for adverse coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcomes. It is uncertain, however, whether older biological age, as assessed by leucocyte telomere length (LTL), is also associated with COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: We associated LTL values obtained from participants recruited into UK Biobank (UKB) during 2006-2010 with adverse COVID-19 outcomes recorded by 30 November 2020, defined as a composite of any of the following: hospital admission, need for critical care, respiratory support, or mortality. Using information on 131 LTL-associated genetic variants, we conducted exploratory Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses in UKB to evaluate whether observational associations might reflect cause-and-effect relationships. Findings: Of 6,775 participants in UKB who had tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the community, there were 914 (13.5%) with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The odds ratio (OR) for adverse COVID-19 outcomes was 1.17 (95% CI 1.05-1.31; P=0.004) per 1-SD shorter usual LTL, after adjustment for chronological age, sex and ethnicity. Similar ORs were observed in analyses that: adjusted for additional risk factors; disaggregated the composite outcome and reduced the scope for selection or collider bias. In MR analyses, the OR for adverse COVID-19 outcomes was directionally concordant but non-significant. Interpretation: Shorter LTL, indicative of older biological age, is associated with higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, independent of several major risk factors for COVID-19 including chronological age. Further data are needed to determine whether this association reflects causality.",Qingning Wang; Veryan Codd; Zahra Raisi-Estabragh; Crispin Musicha; Bountziouka Vasiliki; Stephen Kaptoge; Elias Allara; Emanuele Di Angelantonio; Adam S Butterworth; Angela M Wood; John R Thompson; Steffen E Petersen; Nicholas C Harvey; John N Danesh; Nilesh J Samani; Christopher P Nelson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21254010,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21254010,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
26,Evaluating the neutralizing ability of a CpG-adjuvanted S-2P subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern,"Vaccination is currently the best weapon to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, an alarming number of novel variants termed Variants of Concern (VoC) were found to harbor mutations that diminished the neutralizing capacity of antibodies elicited by the vaccines. We have investigated the neutralizing titers of antibodies from sera of humans and rats immunized with the MVC-COV1901 vaccine against pseudoviruses coated with the wildtype, D614G, B.1.1.7, or B.1.351 spike proteins. Rats vaccinated with two doses of adjuvanted S-2P retained neutralization activities against the B.1.351 variant, albeit with a slight reduction compared to wildtype. Phase 1 vaccinated subjects showed more reduced neutralization abilities against the B.1.351 variant. The study is among the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate dose-dependent neutralizing responses against VoCs, particularly against B.1.351, from different doses of antigen in a clinical trial for a subunit protein COVID-19 vaccine. The appearance of vaccine escape variants is a growing concern facing many current COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Strategies should be adopted against the ever-changing nature of these variants.

27,Lives Saved from Age-Prioritised COVID-19 Vaccination,"BACKGROUND The criteria used to allocate scarce COVID-19 vaccines are hotly contested. While some are pushing just to get vaccines into arms as quickly as possible, others advocate prioritization in terms of risk. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to use demographic models to show the enormous potential of vaccine risk-prioritization in saving lives. METHODS We develop a simple mathematical model that accounts for the age distribution of the population and of COVID-19 mortality. This model considers only the direct live-savings for those who receive the vaccine, and does not account for possible indirect effects of vaccination. We apply this model to the United States, Japan, and Bangladesh. RESULTS In the United States, we find age-prioritization would reduce deaths during a vaccine campaign by about 93 percent relative to no vaccine and 85 percent relative to age-neutral vaccine distribution. In countries with younger age structures, such as Bangladesh, the benefits of age-prioritization are even greater. CONTRIBUTION For policy makers, our findings give additional support to risk-prioritized allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. For demographers, our results show how the age-structures of the population and of disease mortality combine into an expression of risk concentration that shows the benefits of prioritized allocation. This measure can also be used to study the effects of prioritizing other dimensions of risk such as underlying health conditions.",Joshua R Goldstein; Ayesha Mahmud; Thomas Cassidy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253991,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253991,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True

Groundwater and surface water reservoirs for drinking water as well as water from receiving rivers of Monterrey Metropolitan Area were sampled repeatedly during a peak phase between October 2020 and January 2021, and the virus RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Forty-four percent of groundwater samples demonstrated detectable virus loads between 2.9 and 5.6 copies/ml. A significant correlation with sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed the hypothesis of leaching and infiltration of effluents from surface and/or failing sewage pipes, and emphases the importance of water disinfection. Thirteen percent of surface water dam samples tested positive, with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 21% of river samples marked positive for viral RNA, with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 copies/ml. Raw wastewater samples taken in the same period show viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or efficiency of wastewater facilities.

29,Primary care clinical management following self-harm during the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK,"Background A substantial reduction in GP-recorded self-harm occurred during the first wave of COVID-19 but effects on primary care management of self-harm are unknown. Aim To examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical management within three months of an episode of self-harm. Design and setting Prospective cohort study using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Method We compared cohorts of patients with an index self-harm episode recorded during a pre-pandemic period (10th March-10th June, 2010-2019) versus the COVID-19 first-wave period (10th March-10th June 2020). Patients were followed up for three months to capture psychotropic medication prescribing, GP/practice nurse consultation and referral to mental health services. Results 48,739 episodes of self-harm were recorded during the pre-pandemic period and 4,238 during the first-wave COVID-19 period. Similar proportions were prescribed psychotropic medication within 3 months in the pre-pandemic (54.0%) and COVID-19 first-wave (54.9%) cohorts. Likelihood of having at least one GP/practice nurse consultation was broadly similar (83.2% vs. 80.3% in the COVID-19 cohort). The proportion of patients referred to mental health services in the COVID-19 cohort (3.4%) was around half of that in the pre-pandemic cohort (6.5%). Conclusion Despite the challenges experienced by primary healthcare teams during the initial COVID-19 wave, prescribing and consultation patterns following self-harm were broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels. However, the reduced likelihood of referral to mental health services warrants attention. Accessible outpatient and community services for people who have self-harmed are required as the COVID-19 crisis recedes and the population faces new challenges to mental health.",Sarah Steeg; Matthew J Carr; Laszlo Trefan; Darren M Ashcroft; Nav Kapur; Emma Nielsen; Brian McMillan; Roger Webb,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253969,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True

A sample of 414 individuals between the ages of 18 and 81 were asked to rate the intensity of the shock, sadness, anger, and fear they experienced due to COVID-19 and respond to items from the Brief Cope questionnaire. The present findings demonstrate that anger was consistently less intense among older adults than younger ones. Emotion-focused coping strategies were more commonly used by younger adults than middle-aged or older ones at the first peak of the outbreak; however, this trend had reversed during the second peak of the pandemic, as the older age groups demonstrated a far greater increase in the use of this form of coping. Results indicate a greater ability to use emotional regulation among older adults than younger ones, as the former are less likely to react to a crisis through anger and more able to adapt coping mechanisms to a dynamic environment.",Marta Malesza,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254050,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254050,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True

Yet, there is limited data on vaccine perceptions in the disability community. Objective: To explore COVID 19 vaccine perceptions in individuals with IDD, their family members, and those who work with them, to inform a statewide vaccine information and messaging project. Methods: A national survey, adapted for the IDD community, was distributed to a convenience sample of IDD organizations throughout New York State, in five languages. Constructs included vaccine intention, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and trusted sources of vaccine information. Zip code data were used to map respondent location and vaccine preferences. Results: Of n= 825 respondents, approximately 75% intended to or had received the vaccine, across roles (i.e., people with disabilities, family members, direct care workers) and racial/ethnic groups. Greater vaccine hesitancy was reported in younger individuals and those making decisions on behalf of a person with IDD. Concerns included side effects and the swiftness of vaccine development. Black and Hispanic participants had heightened concerns about being an experiment for the vaccine. Trusted sources of information included healthcare providers and family members. Respondents who intended/got the vaccine were distributed throughout the state. Conclusions: Vaccine preferences in this New York State disability community sample align with national data. Identified concerns suggest the need for community education that addresses misperceptions.

Exploring the determinants of their willingness to work is crucial to ensuring hospital function during the outbreak. Hence, this study examines the factors affecting the motivation and hesitation of health workers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Study Design: An online, anonymous survey was carried out among Polish healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The responses were gathered during September-December 2020. Results: 912 valid responses were obtained. Of these, 22.8% (N = 208) respondents reported being strongly motivated to work while 37.8% (N = 345) expressed strong hesitation. The participants' demographic characteristics and their responses to the stress-related questions were assigned to four categories depending on the odds ratios of motivation and hesitation. While some factors were linked to enhanced motivation and reduced hesitation, others solely affected either motivation or hesitation, and yet others had a positive impact on both. Conclusion: Overall, the study indicates that in order to increase hospital workers' motivation and decrease their hesitation, they must be made to feel protected by both their hospitals and local and national authorities.",Marta Malesza,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254048,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254048,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
33,Job stress among workers who telecommute during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan: a cross-sectional study,"Objectives: The work system reform and the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan have prompted efforts toward telecommuting in Japan, and there has been little research regarding the stress and health effects of telecommuting. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between telecommuting and job stress among Japanese workers. Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: In December 2020, during the 'third wave' of the COVID-19 pandemic, an Internet-based nationwide health survey of 33,087 Japanese workers (CORoNaWork study) was conducted. Data for 27,036 individuals was included as 6,051 individuals provided invalid responses. We analysed a sample of 13,468 office workers from this database. We classified participants into four groups according to telecommuting frequency and compared the subscale of the Job Content Questionnaire and subjective job stress among these groups: high-frequency, medium-frequency, and low-frequency telecommuters group and non-telecommuters group. We used a linear mixed model and ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results: There was a significant difference in the score of job control of the JCQ among the four groups after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. The high-frequency telecommuters group had the highest job control score. Regarding the fluctuation score of subjective job stress, the high- and medium-frequency telecommuters groups were significantly lower than those of the non-telecommuters group after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. Conclusion: We found that high-frequency telecommuting was associated with high job control. This study suggests that the widespread adoption of telecommuting as a countermeasure to the public health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may also have a positive impact on job stress.",Kazunori Ikegami; Hiroka Baba; Hajime Ando; Ayako Hino; Mayumi Tusji; Seiichiro Tateishi; Tomohisa Nagata; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253958,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253958,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
34,Psychosocial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic: Identification of most vulnerable populations.,"With the aim of analyzing the psychosocial impact of Covid-19 pandemic on society in general and health care workers in particular, we developed a 74-question survey questionnaire which was shared through social media. After analyzing 56,656 responses obtained during the first pandemic peak, the results showed an early and important negative impact on family finances, fear of working with Covid-19 patients and ethical issues related to Covid-19 care among healthcare workers (HCW). We have identified 7 target groups at higher risk of impaired mental health and susceptible to benefiting from an intervention: women, under 42 years of age, people with care burden, socio-economically deprived groups, people with unskilled or unqualified jobs, Covid-19 patients, and HCW working with Covid-19 patients. These results should encourage the active implementation of specific strategies to increase resilience in these groups and to prepare an adequate organizational response.",Judith Farres; Jose Luis Ruiz; Jose Manuel Mas; Lilibeth Arias; Maria-Rosa Sarrias; Carolina Armengol; Pere-Joan Cardona; Jose A Munoz-Moreno; Miriam Vilaplana; Belen Arranz; Judith Usall; Antoni Serrano-Blanco; Cristina Vilaplana,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21254029,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21254029,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
35,Limit of detection in different matrices of nineteen commercially available rapid antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there has been an increase of the use of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT). The performance of Ag-RDT vary greatly between manufacturers and evaluating their analytical limit of detection (LOD) has become high priority. Here we describe a manufacturer-independent evaluation of the LOD of 19 marketed Ag-RDT using live SARS-CoV-2 spiked in different matrices: direct culture supernatant, a dry swab, and a swab in Amies. Additionally, the LOD using dry swab was investigated after 7 days storage at -80{degrees}C of the SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions. An LOD of {approx} 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (1.0 x 106 genome copies/ml) in culture media is defined as acceptable by the World Health Organization. Fourteen of nineteen Ag-RDTs (ActiveXpress, Espline, Excalibur, Innova, Joysbio, Mologic, NowCheck, Orient, PanBio, RespiStrip, Roche, Standard-F, Standard-Q and Sure-Status) exceeded this performance criteria using direct culture supernatant applied to the Ag-RDT. Six Ag-RDT were not compatible with Amies media and a decreased sensitivity of 2 to 20-fold was observed for eleven tests on the stored dilutions at -80{degrees}C for 7 days. Here, we provide analytical sensitivity data to guide appropriate test and sample type selection for use and for future Ag-RDT evaluations.",Ana I Cubas Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Thomas Edwards; Dominic Wooding; Kate Buist; Caitlin R Thompson; Christopher T Williams; Lisa Baldwin; Ian Patterson; Grant Hughes; Camille Escadafal; Jilian Sacks; Emily R Adams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253950,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253950,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
36,Changes in HIV Treatment Differentiated Care Utilization During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Zambia,"Background: Differentiated service delivery (DSD) models aim to lessen the burden of HIV treatment on patients and providers in part by reducing requirements for facility visits and extending dispensing intervals. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, minimizing patient contact with healthcare facilities and other patients, while maintaining treatment continuity and avoiding loss to care, has become more urgent, resulting in efforts to increase DSD uptake. We assessed the extent to which DSD coverage and antiretroviral treatment (ART) dispensing intervals have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia. Methods: We used patient data from Zambia's electronic medical record system (SmartCare) for 737 health facilities, representing about 3/4 of all ART patients nationally, to compare the numbers and proportional distributions of patients enrolled in DSD models in the six months before and six months after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Zambia in March 2020. Segmented linear regression was used to determine whether the introduction of COVID-19 into Zambia further accelerated the increase in DSD scale-up. Results: Between September 2019 and August 2020, 181,317 patients aged 15+ (81,520 and 99,797 from September 1, 2019 to March 1, 2020 and from March 1 to August 31, 2020, respectively) enrolled in DSD models in Zambia. Overall participation in all DSD models increased over the study period, but uptake varied by model. The rate of acceleration increased in the second period for home ART delivery (152%), 0-2-month fast-track (143%), and 3-month MMD (139%). There were significant decelerations in the increase in enrolment for 4-6-month fast-track (-28%) and 'other' models (-19%). Conclusions: Participation in DSD models for stable ART patients in Zambia increased after the advent of COVID-19, but dispensing intervals diminished. Eliminating obstacles to longer dispensing intervals, including those related to supply chain management, should be prioritized to achieve the expected benefits of DSD models and minimize COVID-19 risk.",Youngji Jo; Sydney Rosen; Karla Therese L.

37,Developing machine learning models for predicting intensive care unit resource use during the COVID-19 pandemic,"ABSTRACT Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic has put massive strains on hospitals, and tools to guide hospital planners in resource allocation during the ebbs and flows of the pandemic are urgently needed. Objective: We investigate whether Machine Learning (ML) can be used for predictions of intensive care requirements 5 and 10 days into the future. Design: Retrospective design where health Records from 34,012 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was extracted. Random Forest (RF) models were trained to predict risk of ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation after n days (n = 5, 10). Setting: Two Danish regions, encompassing approx. 2.5 million citizens. Participants: All patients from the bi-regional area with a registered positive SARS-CoV-2 test from March 2020 to January 2021. Main outcomes: Prediction of future 5- and 10-day requirements of ICU admission and ventilator use. Mortality was also predicted. Results. Models predicted 5-day risk of ICU admission with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.986 and 5-day risk of use of ventilation with an ROC-AUC of 0.995. The corresponding 5-day forecasting models predicted the needed ICU capacity with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.930 and use of ventilation with an R2 of 0.934. Performance was comparable but slightly reduced for 10-day forecasting models. Conclusions. Random Forest-based modelling can be used for accurate 5- and 10-day forecasting predictions of ICU resource requirements.",Stephan Slot Lorenzen; Mads Nielsen; Espen Jimenez-Solem; Tonny Studsgaard Petersen; Anders Perner; Hans-Christian Thorsen-Meyer; Christian Igel; Martin Sillesen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253947,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253947,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
38,Reduced BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine response in SARS-CoV-2-naive nursing home residents,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact on nursing home (NH) residents prompted their prioritization for early vaccination. To fill the data gap for vaccine immunogenicity in NH residents, we examined antibody levels after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to spike, receptor binding domain (RBD) and for virus neutralization in 149 NH residents and 111 health care worker controls. SARS-CoV-2-naive NH residents mount antibody responses with nearly 4-fold lower median neutralization titers and half the anti-spike level compared to SARS-CoV-2-naive healthcare workers. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2-recovered vaccinated NH residents had neutralization, anti-spike and anti-RBD titers similar to SARS-CoV-2-recovered vaccinated healthcare workers. NH residents blunted antibody responses have important implications regarding the quality and durability of protection afforded by neoantigen vaccines. We urgently need better longitudinal evidence on vaccine effectiveness specific to NH resident populations to inform best practices for NH infection control measures, outbreak prevention and potential indication for a vaccine boost.",David H.

To date, numerous lung histological studies have shown extensive alveolar damage, but there is scarce documentation of vascular inflammation in postmortem lung tissue. Here we document histopathological features and monitor the NLRP3 inflammasome in fatal cases of disease caused by SARS Cov2 (COVID-19).

40,Symptoms of COVID-19 in a population-based cohort study,"Accurate diagnosis of potential SARS-CoV-2 infections by symptoms is one strategy for continuing global surveillance, particularly in low-resource communities. We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study, the Arizona CoVHORT, among Arizona residents to elucidate the symptom profile of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 participants(16.2%) compared to laboratory-confirmed negative(22.4%) and untested general population participants(61.4%). Among the 1514 study participants, those who were COVID-19 positive were more likely to be Hispanic(33.5%) and more likely to report obesity > 30 kg/m2(34.7%) compared to COVID-19 negative participants(19.2%; 31.0%) and untested CoVHORT participants(13.8%; 23.8%). Of the 245 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 15.0% reported having had no symptoms. Of those that did report symptoms, the most commonly-reported first symptoms were sore throat(19.0%), headache(15.5%), cough(12.7%), runny nose/cold-like symptoms(12.1%), and fatigue(12.0%). In adjusted logistic regression models, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely than negative participants to experience loss of taste and smell(OR:35.7; 95% CI 18.4-69.5); bone or nerve pain(OR:17.9; 95% CI 6.7-47.4), vomiting(OR:10.8; 95% CI 3.1-37.5), nausea(OR:10.5; 95% CI 5.5-19.9), and headache(OR:8.4; 95% CI 5.6-12.8).

41,Role of Combining Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Agents in COVID-19 Treatment: A Rapid Review,"Although primarily affecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 causes multiple organ damage. One of its grave consequences is a prothrombotic state that manifests as thrombotic, microthrombotic, and thromboembolic events.Therefore, understanding the effect of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in the context of COVID-19 treatment is important. The aim of this rapid review is to highlight the role of thrombosis in COVID-19 and provide new insights on the use of antithrombotic therapy in its management. A rapid systematic review was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews. Papers published in English on antithrombotic agent use and COVID-19 complications were eligible. Results showed that the use of anticoagulants increased survival and reduced thromboembolic events in patients. However, despite the use of anticoagulants, patients still suffered thrombotic events likely due to heparin resistance. Data on antiplatelet use in combination with anticoagulants in the setting of COVID-19 is quite scarce. Current side effects of anticoagulation therapy emphasize the need to update treatment guidelines. In this rapid review, we address a possible modulatory role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant combination against COVID-19 pathogenesis. This combination may be an effective form of adjuvant therapy against COVID-19 infection. However, further studies are needed to elucidate potential risks and benefits associated with this combination.",Kamal Matli; Raymond Farah; Mario Maalouf; Christy Costanian; Nibal Chamoun; Georges Ghanem,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253754,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253754,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
42,Network medicine links SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection to brain microvascular injury and neuroinflammation in dementia-like cognitive impairment,"BackgroundDementia-like cognitive impairment is an increasingly reported complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this complication remain unclear. A better understanding of causative processes by which COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment is essential for developing preventive interventions.

MethodsIn this study, we conducted a network-based, multimodal genomics comparison of COVID-19 and neurologic complications. We constructed the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome from protein-protein interaction assay and CRISPR-Cas9 based genetic assay results, and compared network-based relationships therein with those of known neurological manifestations using network proximity measures. We also investigated the transcriptomic profiles (including single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing) of Alzheimers disease (AD) marker genes from patients infected with COVID-19, as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the brains of AD patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsWe found significant network-based relationships between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation and brain microvascular injury pathways and processes which are implicated in AD. We also detected aberrant expression of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with COVID-19. While transcriptomic analyses showed relatively low expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in human brain, neuroinflammatory changes were pronounced. In addition, single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses showed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors (BSG and FURIN) and antiviral defense genes (LY6E, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFNAR1) was significantly elevated in brain endothelial cells of AD patients and healthy controls relative to neurons and other cell types, suggesting a possible role for brain microvascular injury in COVID-19-mediated cognitive impairment. Notably, individuals with the AD risk allele APOE E4/E4 displayed reduced levels of antiviral defense genes compared to APOE E3/E3 individuals.

ConclusionOur results suggest significant mechanistic overlap between AD and COVID-19, strongly centered on neuroinflammation and microvascular injury. These results help improve our understanding of COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations and provide guidance for future development of preventive or treatment interventions.",Yadi Zhou; Jielin Xu; Yuan Hou; James B.

Many inhibitors of viral enzymes identified in vitro have limited efficacy against viral replication in cells, but conventional plaque assays are impractical for high-throughput screens. In this study, we therefore engineer cell-based biosensors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our assays exploit the cleavage of specific oligopeptide linkers by SARS-CoV-2 Main or Papain-like proteases, leading to the activation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase-based reporters. First, we characterise these biosensors in cells using recombinant viral proteases. Next, we confirm their ability to detect endogenous viral protease expression during infection with wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we develop a sensitive luminescent reporter cell line, confirm that it accurately quantitates infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, and demonstrate its utility for drug screening and titration of neutralising antibodies.",Pehuen Pereyra Gerber; Lidia M Duncan; Edward JD Greenwood; Sara Marelli; Adi Naamati; Ana Teixeira-Silva; Thomas WM Crozier; Ildar Gabaev; Jun R Zhan; Anna V Protasio; Nicholas J Matheson,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.435957,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.435957,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
44,CVnCoV protects human ACE2 transgenic mice from ancestral B BavPat1 and emerging B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines as the primary control option. Recently, viral mutants termed ""variants of concern"" (VOC) have emerged with the potential to escape host immunity. VOC B.1.351 was first discovered in South Africa in late 2020, and causes global concern due to poor neutralization with propensity to evade preexisting immunity from ancestral strains. We tested the efficacy of a spike encoding mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against the ancestral strain BavPat1 and the novel VOC B.1.351 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice developed elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody as well as neutralization titers against the ancestral strain BavPat1. Neutralization titers against VOC B.1.351 were readily detectable but significantly reduced compared to BavPat1. VOC B.1.351-infected control animals experienced a delayed course of disease, yet nearly all SARS-CoV-2 challenged naive mice succumbed with virus dissemination and high viral loads. CVnCoV vaccine completely protected the animals from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in oral swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Only partial protection was observed in mice receiving the formalin-inactivated virus preparation. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV shows complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies.",Donata Hoffmann; Bjoern Corleis; Susanne Rauch; Nicole Roth; Janine Muehe; Nico Joel Halwe; Lorenz Ulrich; Charlie Fricke; Jacob Schoen; Anna Kraft; Angele Breithaupt; Kerstin Wernike; Anna Michelitsch; Franziska Sick; Claudia Wylezich; Stefan O.

Here we describe the EG-COVID which is a novel liposome-based mRNA candidate vaccine that encodes the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 2P-3Q substitution in European variant. We developed the mRNA vaccine platform that can be lyophilized using liposome-based technology. Intramuscular injection of the EG-COVID elicited robust humoral and cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, sera obtained from mice successfully inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral infection into Vero cells.

46,Predicting hosts based on early SARS-CoV-2 samples and analyzing later world-wide pandemic in 2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has raised the concern for identifying hosts of the virus since the early-stage outbreak. To address this problem, we proposed a deep learning method, DeepHoF, based on extracting the viral genomic features automatically, to predict host likelihood scores on five host types, including plant, germ, invertebrate, non-human vertebrate and human, for novel viruses. DeepHoF made up for the lack of an accurate tool applicable to any novel virus and overcame the limitation of the sequence similarity-based methods, reaching a satisfactory AUC of 0.987 on the five-classification. Additionally, to fill the gap in the efficient inference of host species for SARS-CoV-2 using existed tools, we conducted a deep analysis on the host likelihood profile calculated by DeepHoF. Using the isolates sequenced in the earliest stage of COVID-19, we inferred minks, bats, dogs and cats were potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2, while minks might be one of the most noteworthy hosts. Several genes of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated their significance in determining the host range. Furthermore, the large-scale genome analysis, based on DeepHoFs computation for the later world-wide pandemic in 2020, disclosed the uniformity of host range among SARS-CoV-2 samples and the strong association of SARS-CoV-2 between humans and minks.",Qian Guo; Mo Li; Chunhui Wang; Jinyuan Guo; Xiaoqing Jiang; Jie Tan; Shufang Wu; Peihong Wang; Tingting Xiao; Zhencheng Fang; Yonghong Xiao; Huaiqiu Zhu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.436312,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.436312,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False

Here, we applied live bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to monitor the real-time effects of NAb treatment in prophylaxis and therapy of K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2-nanoluciferase. We visualized sequential spread of virus from the nasal cavity to the lungs followed by systemic spread to various organs including the brain, culminating in death. Highly potent NAbs from a COVID-19 convalescent subject prevented, and also effectively resolved, established infection when administered within three days of infection. In addition to direct neutralization, in vivo efficacy required Fc effector functions of NAbs, with contributions from monocytes, neutrophils and natural killer cells, to dampen inflammatory responses and limit immunopathology. Thus, our study highlights the requirement of both Fab and Fc effector functions for an optimal in vivo efficacy afforded by NAbs against SARS-CoV-2.",Irfan Ullah; Jeremie Prevost; Mark S.

48,Structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/human ACE2 complex interface can identify high-affinity variants associated with increased transmissibility,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are conformationally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S447N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S447N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.",Hin Hark Gan; Alan Twaddle; Benoit Marchand; Kris Gunsalus,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436454,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436454,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
49,TMPRSS2 inhibitor discovery facilitated through an in silico and biochemical screening platform,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for new antiviral targets, as many of the currently approved drugs have proven ineffective against mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The host transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is a highly promising antiviral target, as it plays a direct role in priming the spike protein before viral entry occurs. Further, unlike other targets such as ACE2, TMPRSS2 has no known biological role. Here we utilize virtual screening to curate large libraries into a focused collection of potential inhibitors. Optimization of a recombinant expression and purification protocol for the TMPRSS2 peptidase domain facilitates subsequent biochemical screening and characterization of selected compounds from the curated collection in a kinetic assay. In doing so, we demonstrate that serine protease inhibitors camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate inhibit through a covalent mechanism. We further identify new non-covalent compounds as TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors, demonstrating the utility of a combined virtual and experimental screening campaign in rapid drug discovery efforts.",Amanda L Peiffer; Julie M Garlick; Yujin Wu; Matthew B Soellner; Charles L Brooks III; Anna K Mapp,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436465,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436465,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
50,Differential effects of the second SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose on T cell immunity in naive and COVID-19 recovered individuals,"The rapid development and deployment of mRNA-based vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the design of accelerated vaccination schedules that have been extremely effective in naive individuals. While a two-dose immunization regimen with the BNT162b2 vaccine has been demonstrated to provide a 95% efficacy in naive individuals, the effects of the second vaccine dose in individuals who have previously recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection has been questioned. Here we characterized SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in naive and previously infected individuals during full BNT162b2 vaccination. Our results demonstrate that the second dose increases both the humoral and cellular immunity in naive individuals. On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.",Carmen Camara; Daniel Lozano-Ojalvo; Eduardo Lopez-Granados; Estela Paz-Artal; Marjorie Pion; Rafael Correa-Rocha; Alberto Ortiz; Marcos Lopez-Hoyos; Marta Erro Iribarren; Jose Portoles; Pilar Portoles; Mayte Perez-Olmeda; Jesus Oteo-Iglesias; Cecilia Berin; Ernesto Guccione; Antonio Bertoletti; Jordi Ochando,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436441,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436441,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
51,Characterisation of B.1.1.7 and Pangolin coronavirus spike provides insights on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmission, pathogenesis and immune resistance has jeopardised the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Determining the fundamental biology of viral variants and understanding their evolutionary trajectories will guide current mitigation measures, future genetic surveillance and vaccination strategies. Here we examine virus entry by the B.1.1.7 lineage, commonly referred to as the UK/Kent variant. Pseudovirus infection of model cell lines demonstrate that B.1.1.7 entry is enhanced relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain, particularly under low expression of receptor ACE2. Moreover, the entry characteristics of B.1.1.7 were distinct from that of its predecessor strain containing the D614G mutation. These data suggest evolutionary tuning of spike protein function. Additionally, we found that amino acid deletions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike were important for efficient entry by B.1.1.7. The NTD is a hotspot of diversity across sarbecoviruses, therefore, we further investigated this region by examining the entry of closely related CoVs. Surprisingly, Pangolin CoV spike entry was 50-100 fold enhanced relative to SARS-CoV-2; suggesting there may be evolutionary pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 may further optimise entry. Swapping the NTD between Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that changes in this region alone have the capacity to enhance virus entry. Thus, the NTD plays a hitherto unrecognised role in modulating spike activity, warranting further investigation and surveillance of NTD mutations.",Samuel J Dicken; Matthew J Murray; Lucy G Thorne; Ann-Kathrin Reuschl; Calum Forrest; Maaroothen Ganeshalingham; Luke Muir; Mphatso D Kalemera; Machaela Palor; Laura E McCoy; Clare Jolly; Greg J Towers; Matthew Reeves; Joe Grove,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436468,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436468,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
52,Replicative fitness SARS-CoV-2 20I/501Y.V1 variant in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium,"Since its emergence in 2019, circulating populations of the new coronavirus continuously acquired genetic diversity. At the end of 2020, a variant named 20I/501Y.V1 (lineage B.1.1.7) emerged and replaced other circulating strains in several regions. This phenomenon has been poorly associated to biological evidence that this variant and original strain exhibit different phenotypic characteristics. Here, we analyse the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain (lineage B1). Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However, when both viruses were put in competition in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that this new variant replicates more efficiently and could contribute to better understand the progressive replacement of circulating strains by the SARS-CoV-2 20I/501Y.V1 variant.",Franck Touret; Lea Luciani; Cecile Baronti; Maxime Cochin; Jean-Selim Driouich; Magali Gilles; Laurence Thirion; Antoine Nougairede; Xavier de Lamballerie,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436427,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436427,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
53,A Queuing Model for Ventilator Capacity Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"We present a queue model to inform ventilator capacity management under different COVID-19 pandemic scenarios. Our model was used to support ventilator capacity planning during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The core of our framework is an extended Erlang loss model, which incorporates COVID-19 case projections, along with the proportion of cases requiring a ventilator, the delay from symptom onset to ventilation, non-COVID-19 ventilator demand, and ventilation time. We implemented our model using discrete event simulation to forecast ventilator utilization. The results predict when capacity would be reached and the rate at which patients would be unable to access a ventilator. We further determined the number of ventilators required to meet a performance indicator target for ventilator access. We applied our model to BC by calibrating to the BC Intensive Care Unit Database and by using local epidemic projections. Epidemic scenarios with and without reduced transmission, due to social distancing and other behavioral changes, were used to link public health interventions to operational impacts on ventilator utilization. The results predict that reduced transmission could potentially avert up to 50 deaths per day by ensuring that ventilator capacity would likely not be reached. Without reduced transmission, an additional 181 ventilators would be required to meet our performance indicator target that 95% of patients can access a ventilator immediately. Our model provides a tool for policy makers to quantify the interplay between public health interventions, necessary critical care resources, and performance indicators for patient access.",Samantha Zimmerman; Alexander R Rutherford; Alexa van der Waall; Monica Norena; Peter Dodek,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253488,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253488,2021-03-21,2021-03-21,,True
54,Effect of vaccination on transmission of COVID-19: an observational study in healthcare workers and their households,"BackgroundThe effect of vaccination for COVID-19 on onward transmission is unknown.

MethodsA national record linkage study determined documented COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations in unvaccinated household members of vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers from 8th December 2020 to 3rd March 2021. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 14 days following the first dose.

ResultsThe cohort comprised of 194,362 household members (mean age 31{middle dot}1 {+/-} 20{middle dot}9 years) and 144,525 healthcare workers (mean age 44{middle dot}4 {+/-} 11{middle dot}4 years). 113,253 (78{middle dot}3%) of healthcare workers received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and 36,227 (25{middle dot}1%) received a second dose. There were 3,123 and 4,343 documented COVID-19 cases and 175 and 177 COVID-19 hospitalisations in household members of healthcare workers and healthcare workers respectively. Household members of vaccinated healthcare workers had a lower risk of COVID-19 case compared to household members of unvaccinated healthcare worker (rate per 100 person-years 9{middle dot}40 versus 5{middle dot}93; HR 0{middle dot}70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}63 to 0{middle dot}78).

Thus, there is a need for therapeutic molecules with distinct and novel neutralization mechanisms. Here we isolated a nanobody that potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, including the B.1.351 variant, and cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the nanobody in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. Using biochemistry and electron cryomicroscopy we show that this nanobody simultaneously interacts with two RBDs from different spike trimers, rapidly inducing the formation of spike trimer-dimers.

56,Interferon Resistance of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility, pathogenesis and resistance to vaccines presents urgent challenges for curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. While Spike mutations that enhance virus infectivity may drive the emergence of these novel variants, studies documenting a critical a role for interferon responses in the early control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, combined with the presence of viral genes that limit these responses, suggest that interferons may also influence SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here, we compared the potency of 17 different human interferons against 5 viral lineages sampled during the course of the global outbreak that included ancestral and emerging variants. Our data revealed increased interferon resistance in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicating that evasion of innate immunity is a significant driving force for SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

57,Circadian regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is a global health issue with unprecedented challenges for public health. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, via binding human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2)1,2, and infection can result in pneumonia and acute respiratory dist ress syndrome. Circadian rhythms coordinate an organisms response to its environment and recent studies report a role for the circadian clock to regulate host susceptibility to virus infection3. Influenza A infection of arhythmic mice, lacking the circadian component BMAL1, results in higher viral replication4 and elevated inflammatory responses leading to more severe bronchitis5,6, highlighting the impact of circadian pathways in respiratory function. We demonstrate circadian regulation of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells and show that silencing BMAL1 or treatment with the synthetic REV-ERB agonist SR9009 reduces ACE2 expression and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry and RNA replication. Treating infected cells with SR9009 limits viral replication and secretion of infectious particles, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are influenced by the circadian system.

Based on high-resolution structures, the two viruses bind in practically identical conformations, although several residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) differ between them. Here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning (ML), and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate the differences in RBD binding by the two viruses. Although only subtle differences were observed from the initial MD simulations of the two RBD-ACE2 complexes, ML identified the individual residues with the most distinctive ACE2 interactions, many of which have been highlighted in previous experimental studies. FEP calculations quantified the corresponding differences in binding free energies to ACE2, and examination of MD trajectories provided structural explanations for these differences. Lastly, the energetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations were studied, showing that the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 is increased by N501Y and E484K mutations but is slightly decreased by K417N.",Anna Pavlova; Zijian Zhang; Atanu Acharya; Diane L Lynch; Yui Tik Pang; Zhongyu Mou; Jerry M Parks; Chris Chipot; James C.

Using high-throughput screening, we identified acriflavine as a potent papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitor. NMR titrations and a co-crystal structure confirm that acriflavine blocks the PLpro catalytic pocket in an unexpected binding mode. We show that the drug inhibits viral replication at nanomolar concentration in cellular models, in vivo in mice and ex vivo in human airway epithelia, with broad range activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses.

61,Cancer services during the COVID-19 pandemic: systematic review of patients' and caregivers' experiences,"BackgroundCancer patients have faced intersecting crises in the face of COVID-19 pandemic. This review aimed to examine patients and caregivers experiences of accessing cancer services during the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived impact of the pandemic on their psychological wellbeing.

MethodsA protocol-led (CRD42020214906) systematic review was conducted by searching six databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL for articles published in English-language between 1/2020-12/2020. Data were extracted using a pilot-tested, structured data extraction form. Thematic synthesis of data was undertaken and reported as per the PRISMA guideline.

ResultsA total of 1110 articles were screened of which 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies originated from 10 different countries including the US, UK, India and China. Several themes were identified which were categorised into seven categories. Postponement and delays in cancer screening and treatment, drug shortages and inadequate nursing care were commonly experienced by patients. Hospital closures, resource constraints, national lockdowns and patient reluctance to use health services because of infection worries contributed to the delay. Financial and social distress, isolation; and spiritual distress due to the uncertainty of rites as well as fulfilment of last wishes were also commonly reported. Caregivers felt anxious about infecting cancer patients with COVID-19.

ConclusionsPatients and caregivers experienced extensive impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening, treatment and care, and their own psychological wellbeing. Patient and caregiver views and preferences should be incorporated in ensuring resilient cancer services that can minimise the impact of ongoing and future pandemic on cancer care and mitigate patient fears.

62,The effects of physical distancing and lockdown to restrain SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the Italian Municipality of Cogne,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 started in Wuhan, China, and is now a pandemic. An understanding of the prevalence and contagiousness of the disease, and of whether the strategies used to contain it to date have been successful, is important for understanding future containment strategies. One strategy for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is to adopt strong social distancing policies. The Municipality of Cogne (I), adopted strict lockdown rules from March 4, 2020 up to May 18, 2020. This first wave of the pandemic impressed by the extremely low impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the locals, compared to the number accused on all the Italian territory. Starting from October 2020 up to the end of December, when the second wave hit Italy and Cogne territory, heavier effects were observed. In order to cast light on the effectiveness of the adopted strategy 74,5% of the local population underwent to a blood screening to detect IgM and IgG antibodies and after six months all the people tested positive were again investigated to establish the longitudinal changes in antibodies level.

63,A Prospective Study of Long-Term Outcomes Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients with and without Neurological Complications,"BackgroundLittle is known regarding long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective study of 6-month outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with new neurological complications during hospitalization who survived were propensity score-matched to COVID-19 survivors without neurological complications hospitalized during the same period. The primary 6-month outcome was multivariable ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (ADLs;Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep.

ResultsOf 606 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, 395 survived hospitalization and were matched to 395 controls; N=196 neurological patients and N=186 controls completed follow-up. Overall, 346/382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal outcome: 56% had limited ADLs, 50% impaired cognition, 47% could not return to work and 62% scored worse than average on [&ge;]1 Neuro-QoL scale (worse anxiety 46%, sleep 38%, fatigue 36%, and depression 25%). In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications had worse 6-month mRS (median 4 vs. 3 among controls, adjusted OR 2.03, 95%CI 1.22-3.40, P=0.01), worse ADLs (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.29-0.74, P=0.01) and were less likely to return to work than controls (41% versus 64%, P=0.04).

64,Integrated immunovirological profiling validates plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA as an early predictor of COVID-19 mortality,"Despite advances in COVID-19 management, it is unclear how to recognize patients who evolve towards death. This would allow for better risk stratification and targeting for early interventions. However, the explosive increase in correlates of COVID-19 severity complicates biomarker prioritisation. To identify early biological predictors of mortality, we performed an immunovirological assessment (SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, cytokines and tissue injury markers, antibody responses) on plasma samples collected from 144 hospitalised COVID-19 patients 11 days after symptom onset and used to test models predicting mortality within 60 days of symptom onset. In the discovery cohort (n=61, 13 fatalities), high SARS-CoV-2 vRNA, low RBD-specific IgG levels, low SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and elevated levels of several cytokines and lung injury markers were strongly associated with increased mortality in the entire cohort and the subgroup on mechanical ventilation. Model selection revealed that a three-variable model of vRNA, age and sex was very robust at identifying patients who will succumb to COVID-19 (AUC=0.86, adjusted HR for log-transformed vRNA=3.5; 95% CI: 2.0-6.0).

65,Heightened COVID-19 Vaccine Response following SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines now available are highly effective at preventing infection and afford the prospect of an end to the pandemic. Vaccines are in scare supply, however. Current recommendations in the United States are that subjects with a previous history of SARS CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease should receive the full vaccine regimen. This is despite the fact that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection infection confers some degree of protection and that the immune response to the vaccine is not well studied.

MethodsThe present study compared the time course and magnitude of the humoral immune response to an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2) in subjects with prior infection/COVID-19 disease (n=24) and those without prior infection (n=25). Serum anti-Spike RBD antibody and serum neutralizing activity were assessed longitudinally prior to and at 2-week intervals for 56 days post first dose of vaccine. Subjects received the standard Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine regimen i.e., two doses of 30 {micro}g, 3 weeks apart.

FindingsThe cohort with prior COVID-19 achieved robust increases in anti-Spike IgG antibody and serum neutralizing activity compared to the SARS-CoV-2 naive cohort at day 14 post vaccine. Thereafter, the COVID-19 cohort showed relatively little further increase in humoral immunity even after the second dose such that anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing activity were similar in the 2 groups from day 28 through day 56.

ConclusionsIn contrast to the responses of SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects in whom a 2 dose regimen appears to be required to achieve robust immune protection, subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit immune memory and have a robust response to the first dose of an mRNA vaccine. They may require only a single dose of vaccine.",Steven G. Kelsen; Alan Braverman; Puja Patel; Mark O.

66,"Development and validation of the long covid symptom and impact tools, a set of patient-reported instruments constructed from patients' lived experience","ObjectivesTo develop and validate patient-reported instruments, based on patients lived experiences, for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.

DesignThe long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long covid. Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 and symptoms extending over three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-covid functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The ""patient acceptable symptomatic state"" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method.

ResultsValidation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed covid-19, 79% female and 12.5% hospitalised for covid-19). The long covid ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and 0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33).

ConclusionsThe long covid ST and IT tools, constructed from patients lived experiences, provide the first validated and reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.

67,Assessing the utility of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19,"BackgroundCOronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be challenging to diagnose, because symptoms are non-specific, clinical presentations are heterogeneous, and false negative tests can occur. Our objective was to assess the utility of lymphocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 or another respiratory infection (i.e., influenza, CAP) at seven hospitals in Ontario, Canada.The first available lymphocyte count during the hospitalization was used. Standard test characteristics for lymphocyte count (x109/L) were calculated (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve [AUC]). All analyses were conducting using R.

ResultsThere were 869 hospitalizations for COVID-19, 669 for influenza, and 3009 for CAP. The mean age across the three groups was 67 and patients with pneumonia were older than those with influenza or COVID19, and approximately 46% were woman. The median lymphocyte count was nearly identical for the three groups of patients: 1.0 x109/L (interquartile range [IQR]:0.7,2.0) for COVID-19, 0.9 x109/L (IQR 0.6,1.0) for influenza, and 1.0 x109/L (IQR 0.6,2.0) for CAP. At a lymphocyte threshold of less than 2.0 x109/L, the sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was approximately 10%. As the lymphocyte threshold increased, the sensitivity of diagnosing COVID-19 increased while the specificity decreased. The AUC for lymphocyte count was approximately 50%.

InterpretationLymphocyte count has poor diagnostic discrimination to differentiate between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. The lymphopenia we consistently observed across the three illnesses in our study may reflect a non-specific sign of illness severity. However, lymphocyte count above 2.0 x109/L may be useful in ruling out COVID-19 (sensitivity = 87%).",Mike Fralick; Orly Bogler; Daniel Tamming; Lauren Lapointe-Shaw; Janice Kwan; Terence Tang; Shail Rawal; Jessica Liu; Fahad Razak; Amol A Verma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21252922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21252922,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
68,Comparing the efficacy of anti-infectious drugs for the treatment of mild to severe COVID-19 patients: a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a viral infection spreading at a great speed and has quickly caused an extensive burden to individuals, families, countries, and the world. No intervention has yet been proven highly effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Different drugs were being evaluated and reported through randomized clinical trials, and more are currently under trial. This review aimed to compare the efficacy of anti-infectious drugs with a comparator of the standard of care or placebo in patients with COVID-19.

Methods and analysisTwo independent review authors will extract data and assess a risk of bias using RoB2. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that evaluate single and/or combined antiviral drugs recommended by WHO latest guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 will be included. We will search for Pub Med, the Cochrane Center for Clinical Trial database (CENTRAL), clinicaltrials.gov, etc. databases for articles published in the English language between December 2019 to April 2021. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) involving Network Meta-analysis guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoints will be time to clinical recovery and time to RNA negativity. The certainty of evidence will be evaluated using the GRADE extension of NMA. Data analysis will be performed using the frequentist NMA approach with netmeta package implemented in R.

Ethics and disseminationThere are no ethical considerations associated with this study as we will use publicly available data from previously published studies. We plan to publish results in open access peer-reviewed journals.

69,"First wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pandemic preparedness powered by early warning: A study of Ahmedabad, India","Following the proven concept, capabilities, and limitations of detecting the RNA of Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater, it is pertinent to understand the utility of wastewater surveillance data on various scale. In the present work, we put forward the first wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pandemic preparedness. A three-month data of Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP) was generated for the world heritage city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. In this expedition, one hundred sixteen wastewater samples were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, from September 3rd to November 26th, 2020. A total of 111 samples were detected with at least two out of three SARS-CoV-2 genes (N, ORF 1ab, and S). Monthly variation depicted a significant decline in all three gene copies in October compared to September 2020, followed by a sharp increment in November 2020. Correspondingly, the descending order of average genome concentration was: November ([~]10729 copies/ L) > September ([~]3047 copies/ L) > October ([~]454 copies/ L). Monthly variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples may be ascribed to a decline of 19.3% in the total number of active cases in October 2020 and a rise of 1.82% in November 2020. Also, the monthly recovery rate of patients was 16.61, 19.31, and 15.58% in September, October, and November 2020, respectively. The percentage change in the genome concentration was observed in the lead of 1-2 weeks with respect to the provisional figures of confirmed cases. SWEEP data-based city zonation was matched with the heat map of the overall COVID-19 infected population in Ahmedabad city, and month-wise effective RNA concentration variations are shown on the map. The results expound on the potential of WBE surveillance of COVID-19 as a city zonation tool that can be meaningfully interpreted, predicted, and propagated for community preparedness through advance identification of COVID-19 hotspots within a given city.

ObjectiveTo describe the specific details of mitigation strategies employed at 17 K-12 schools in Wisconsin during a time of exceptionally high COVID-19 community disease prevalence where in-school transmission was minimal. The aim of this report is to assist school districts and governing bodies in developing full-time return to school plans.

Results89.3% of elementary students included in our study did not maintain 6 feet of physical distancing in the classroom and 94.8% were within 6 feet in lunchrooms. The majority of secondary students (86.2%) were able to maintain 6 feet of distancing in the classroom but no students were greater than 6 feet in the hallways. 58.8% of schools did not install new ventilation systems prior to the school year. Students ate lunch indoors. Bussing of students continued and all elementary children were allowed to go without masks at recess.

Conclusion and relevanceIn the setting of high community COVID-19 disease transmission, 6 feet of distance between elementary students and major ventilation system renovations in primary or secondary schools do not appear to be necessary to minimize disease spread. Requiring masks at recess and prohibiting bussing also appears unnecessary.

71,Sarcopenic obesity and the risk of hospitalisation or death from COVID-19: findings from UK Biobank,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease{square}2019 (COVID{square}19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS{square}CoV{square}2 virus). The role of skeletal muscle mass in modulating immune response is well documented. Whilst obesity is well-established as a key factor in COVID-19 infection and outcome, no study has examined the influence of both sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and obesity, termed  sarcopenic obesity on COVID-19 risk.

MethodsThis study uses data from UK Biobank. Probable sarcopenia was defined as low handgrip strength. Sarcopenic obesity was mutually exclusively defined as the presence of obesity and low muscle mass (based on two established criteria: appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted for either: 1) height and 2) body mass index (BMI)).  Severe COVID-19 was defined by a positive test result in a hospital setting or death with a primary cause reported as COVID-19. Fully adjusted logistic regression models were used to analyse the associations between sarcopenic status and severe COVID-19. This work was conducted under UK Biobank application number 52553.

ResultsWe analysed data from 490,301 UK Biobank participants. 2203 (0.4%) had severe COVID-19 infection. Individuals with probable sarcopenia were 64% more likely to have had severe COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR) 1.638; P<.001). Obesity increased the likelihood of severe COVID-19 infection by 76% (P<.001). Using either ALM index and ALM/BMI index to define low muscle mass, those with sarcopenic obesity were 2.6 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 (OR: 2.619; P<.001). Sarcopenia alone did not increase the risk of COVID-19.

ConclusionsSarcopenic obesity may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection, over that of obesity alone. The mechanisms for this are complex but could be a result of a reduction in respiratory functioning, immune response, and ability to respond to metabolic stress.",Thomas Wilkinson; Thomas Yates; Luke A Baker; Francesco Zaccardi; Alice C Smith,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253945,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253945,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
72,Effect of Increased Alcohol Consumption During COVID-19 Pandemic on Alcohol-related Liver Disease: A Modelling Study,"ObjectivesThe burden of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is surging in the US. There is evidence that alcohol consumption increased during the early periods of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We describe the impact of increased alcohol consumption on alcohol-related liver disease.

DesignMicrosimulation model

SettingModel parameters estimated from publicly available data sources, including national surveys on drug and alcohol use and published studies informing the impact of alcohol consumption on ALD severity.

ParticipantsUS residents

MethodsWe extended a previously validated microsimulation model that estimated the short- and long-term effect of increased drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals in the US born between 1950-2012. We modelled short- and long-term outcomes of current drinking patterns during COVID-19 (status quo) using survey data of changes in alcohol consumption in a nationally representative sample between February and April 2020. We compared these outcomes with a counter-factual scenario wherein no COVID-19 occurs, and drinking patterns do not change. Reported outcomes are for individuals aged 18-65.

Main outcome measuresALD-related deaths inclusive of HCC mortality, the prevalence and incidence of decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)

ResultsIncreases in alcohol consumption during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic are estimated to result in to 8,200 [95% UI 7,700 - 8,700] additional ALD-related deaths (1% increase compared with the counter-factual scenario), 17,100 [95% UI 16,100 - 18,200] cases of decompensated cirrhosis (2% increase) and 1,100 [95% UI 1,100 - 1,200] cases of HCC (1% increase) between 2020 and 2040. Between 2020 and 2023, alcohol consumption changes due to COVID-19 will lead to 100 [100-200] additional deaths and 2,200 [2,200-2,300] additional decompensations in patients suffering from alcohol-related liver disease.

ConclusionsA short-term increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic can substantially increase long-term ALD-related morbidity and mortality. Our findings highlight the need for individuals and policymakers to make informed decisions to mitigate the impact of high-risk alcohol drinking in the US.

73,Smoking and Vaping Among a National Sample of U.S. Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionWith concerns about cigarette smoking being a risk factor for severe disease from COVID-19, understanding nicotine and tobacco use patterns is important for preventive efforts. We aimed to understand changes in product use behaviors among U.S. adult combustible cigarette smokers and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users.

MethodsIn August 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of adults age >18 in NORCs AmeriSpeak Panel who reported past 6-month use of combustible cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with increased product use and quit attempts since hearing about COVID-19.

Results1024 past 6-month cigarette smokers and/or e-cigarette users were surveyed. Among cigarette smokers, 45% reported no change in cigarette smoking and 33% increased cigarette smoking since hearing about COVID-19. Higher stress was associated with increased cigarette smoking. Among e-cigarette users, 41% reported no change in and 23% reported increasing e-cigarette use. 26% of cigarette smokers and 41% of e-cigarette users tried to quit because of COVID-19. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 was associated with attempts to quit combustible cigarettes (AOR 2.37, 95% CI 1.59-3.55) and e-cigarettes (AOR 3.14, 1.73-5.70).

ConclusionsCigarette and e-cigarette use patterns varied in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users perceived product use as increasing COVID-19-related health risks, and this was associated with attempts to quit. Others, especially those reporting higher stress, increased product use.

74,COVID-19 Implications of the Physical Interaction of Artificial Fog on Respiratory Aerosols,"IntroductionArtificial fog is used in the film, television, and live entertainment industries to enhance lighting, as a visual effect, and to create a specific sense of mood or atmosphere. This study investigated whether the suspension time of respiratory aerosols spiked with tagged DNA tracers would change in the presence of glycerin- or glycol-containing artificial fogs.

Methods & MaterialsRespiratory aerosols with tagged DNA tracers were sprayed into a closed environment without and with glycerin- or glycol-containing artificial fog, with air samples taken at regular intervals to determine the decay of tagged DNA tracer over time. The study treatments included Control (no fog), Glycerin Low (3 mg/m3), Glycerin High ([~]15 mg/m3), Glycol Low ([~]5 mg/m3), and Glycol High ([~]40 mg/m3).

ResultsAll artificial fog treatments had lower mean log reduction curves compared to the Control treatment. Compared to the Control and Glycerin Low treatments, the differences in mean log reduction for nearly all other artificial fog treatments were statistically significant (p<0.001); the difference between Control and Glycerin Low treatments was not statistically significant (p=0.087). The differences in mean log reduction between treatments using the same artificial fog type were not statistically significant.

ConclusionArtificial fog use does not increase suspension time of respiratory aerosols, and therefore does not appear to increase the risk of airborne transmission of diseases from respiratory aerosols, such as COVID-19. Of the two types of artificial fogs investigated, that containing glycol decreased suspension time more than that containing glycerin. In practice, the additional reduction in suspension time provided by the physical interaction of respiratory aerosols with artificial fog does not suggest any practical benefit for using artificial fog as a control measure.",Matthew Loss; Mark Katchen; Ilan Arvelo; Phil Arnold; Mona Shum,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253891,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253891,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
75,Predicting clinical outcomes in the Machine Learning era: The Piacenza score a purely data driven approach for mortality prediction in COVID-19 Pneumonia,"BackgroundSeveral models have been developed to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but only few have demonstrated enough discriminatory capacity. Machine-learning(ML) algorithms represent a novel approach for data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modelling. We developed the Piacenza score, a ML-based score, to predict 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods852 patients (mean age 70years, 70%males) were enrolled from February to November 2020. The dataset was randomly splitted into derivation and test. The Piacenza score was obtained through the Naive Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients. Using a forward-search algorithm the following six features were identified: age; mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration; PaO2 /FiO2 ratio; temperature; previous stroke; gender. In case one or more of the features are not available for a patient, the model can be re-trained using only the provided features.

We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a Naive Bayes algorithm with 14 variables chosen a-priori.

ResultsThe Piacenza score showed an AUC of 0.78(95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier-score 0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79(95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier-score 0.16) in the external validation cohort showing a comparable accuracy respect to the 4C score and to the Naive Bayes model with a-priori chosen features, which achieved an AUC of 0.78(95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier-score 0.26) and 0.80(95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier-score 0.17) respectively.

77,Diagnostic accuracy of rapid antigen tests in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts of individuals with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Background Pre-/asymptomatic close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were tested at day 5 after contact by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Diagnostic accuracy of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts was up till now unknown. Methods We performed a prospective cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy study. Close contacts (e.g. selected via the test-and-trace program or contact tracing app) aged [&ge;]16 years and asymptomatic when requesting a test, were included consecutively and tested at day 5 at four Dutch public health service test sites. We evaluated two Ag-RDTs (BD VeritorTM System Ag-RDT (BD), and Roche/SD Biosensor Ag-RDT (SD-B)) with RT-PCR as the reference standard. Virus culture was performed in RT-PCR positive individuals to determine the viral load cut-off above which 95% was culture positive, as a proxy of infectiousness. Results Of 2,678 BD-tested individuals, 233 (8.7%) were RT-PCR positive and BD detected 149 (sensitivity 63.9%; 95% confidence interval 57.4%-70.1%). Out of 1,596 SD-B-tested individuals, 132 (8.3%) were RT-PCR positive and SD-B detected 83 (sensitivity 62.9%; 54.0%-71.1%). When applying an infectiousness viral load cut-off >= 5.2 log10 gene copies/mL, the sensitivity was 90.1% (84.2%-94.4%) for BD, 86.8% (78.1% to 93.0%) for SD-B overall, and 88.1% (80.5%-93.5%) for BD, 85.1% (74.3%-92.6%) for SD-B for those still asymptomatic at the actual time of sampling. Specificity was >99% for both Ag-RDTs in all analyses. Conclusions The sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 of both Ag-RDTs in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts is over 60%, increasing to over 85% after applying an infectiousness viral load cut-off.",Ewoud Schuit; Irene Veldhuijzen; Roderick Venekamp; Wouter Bijllaardt; Susan Pas; Esther Lodder; Richard Molenkamp; Corine GeurtsvanKessel; Jans Velzing; Robin Huisman; Lieke Brouwer; Timo Boelsums; Gregorius Sips; Kim Benschop; Lotty Hooft; Janneke van de Wijgert; Susan van den Hof; Karel Moons,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253874,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253874,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
78,Generation of Inhibitory Autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 in Coronavirus Disease 2019,"ObjectivesIt has recently been shown that von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimers may be a key driver of immunothrombosis in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of autoreactivity, the present study investigates, whether the generation of autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 contributes to this finding.

DesignObservational prospective controlled multicenter study.

SettingBlood samples and clinical data of patients with COVID-19 were collected regularly during hospitalization in the period from April to November 2020.

Patients90 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls participated in this study.

Measuerements and Main ResultsAntibodies to ADAMTS13 occurred in 31 (34.4%) patients with COVID-19. Generation of ADAMTS13 antibodies was associated with a significantly lower ADAMTS13 activity (56.5%, interquartile range (IQR) 21.25 vs. 71.5%, IQR 24.25, p=0.0041), increased disease severity (severe or critical disease in 90% vs. 62.3%, p=0.0189), and a trend to a higher mortality (35.5% vs. 18.6%, p=0.0773). Median time to antibody development was 11 days after first positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR specimen.

ConclusionThe present study demonstrates for the first time, that generation of antibodies to ADAMTS13 is a frequent finding in COVID-19. Generation of these antibodies is associated with a lower ADAMTS13 activity and an increased risk of an adverse course of the disease suggesting an inhibitory effect on the protease. These findings provide a rationale to include ADAMTS13 antibodies in the diagnostic workup of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",Adrian Atilla Nicolas Doevelaar; Martin Bachmann; Bodo Hoelzer; Felix Sebastian Seibert; Benjamin Johannes Rohn; Oliver Witzke; Ulf Dittmer; Thorsten Brenner; Krystallenia Paniskaki; Serap Yilmaz; Rita Dittmer; Sonja Schneppenheim; Nina Babel; Ulrich Budde; Timm Henning Westhoff,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253869,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253869,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
79,"COVID-19 collateral damage: psychological distress and behavioral changes among older adults during the first outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden","IntroductionDuring the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swedish public health authorities provided recommendations for 70+ year old people. They were strongly encouraged to self-isolate but remain physically active in a safe manner. This study aimed to explore the indirect, negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions (collateral damage) by exploring to what extent adherence to such recommendations might have impacted the lives and health of older adults living in central Stockholm.

MethodsAn ad-hoc phone questionnaire was administered by trained staff between May and June 2020 to a random sample of older adults 68+ years old (n=1231), who had attended the regular follow-up assessment of the longitudinal Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) during 2016-2019. We explored three dimensions of collateral damage, namely psychological distress (feelings of worry, stress and loneliness), reductions in social and physical activities, and reductions in medical and social care use. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between age, sex, education and living arrangement, and the risk of collateral damage.

ResultsVast majority of participants adhered to the recommendations, with over three quarters practicing self-isolation (n=928). Half of the sample reported psychological distress, 55.3% reported reductions in social or physical activity, and 11.3% reported decreased medical or social care use. Over three quarters of participants were affected by at least one of the three collateral damage dimensions. Female sex was the strongest sociodemographic predictor of individual as well as co-occurring dimensions of collateral damage.

ConclusionCOVID-19 and its restrictions during the first half of 2020 have had a negative effect on the health and lives of a majority of elderly living in central Stockholm. Women were at a particularly higher risk of these negative consequences. We emphasize the need for predefined, evidence-based interventions to address these negative consequences.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYO_LIThis study uses a large sample of older adults from a well-characterized population-based study (SNAC-K)

80,Serological response to COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients receiving biologics,"ObjectiveThe impact of medications on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in IBD patients is unknown, as patients with immunosuppressed states and/or treated with immunosuppressants were excluded from vaccine trials. To address this, we evaluated serological responses to COVID-19 vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (NIH-Moderna) vaccines in IBD patients enrolled in an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sero-survey at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

DesignWe obtained sera from 48 patients who had undergone vaccination with one or two vaccine doses. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and IgG (Siemens COV2T and sCOVG assays), anti-Spike IgG (in-house ELISA), and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (Roche).

ResultsAll IBD patients (15/15) who completed two-dose vaccine schedules achieved seroconversion to high levels. Two IBD patients with history of COVID-19 infections and who were seropositive at baseline seroconverted to high levels after the first dose. Concurrent biologic use was 85% (41/48), including 33% of patients (16) on TNF antagonist monotherapy, 42% (17) on vedolizumab monotherapy, 6% (3) on vedolizumab combination therapy with thiopurine, and 8% (4) ustekinumab; 1 patient was receiving guselkumab for psoriasis. Three patients (6%) were on oral steroids at the time of vaccination.

ConclusionIBD patients receiving biologics can seroconvert with robust serological responses after complete Pfizer-BioNTech and NIH-Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. In IBD-patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, a single dose of either vaccine can induce high index values, mirroring findings from the general population.",Serre-Yu Wong; Rebekah Dixon; Vicky Martinez Pazos; - ICARUS-IBD; Sacha Gnjatic; Jean-Frederic Colombel; Ken Cadwell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253848,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253848,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
81,COVID-19 Neuropathology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital,"Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop neurological signs and symptoms, though, to date, little evidence exists that primary infection of the brain is a significant contributing factor. We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74 years (38-97 years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24 hours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4 weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.",Kiran Thakur; Emily H Miller; Michael D Glendinning; Osama Al Dalahmah; Matei Banu; Amelia K Boehme; Alex Boubour; Samuel Bruce; Alexander M Chong; Jan Claassen; Phyllis Faust; Gunnar Hargus; Richard Hickman; Sachin Jambawalikar; Alexander Khandji; Carla Kim; Robyn S Klein; Angela Lignelli-Dipple; Chun-Chieh Lin; Yang Liu; Michael Miller; Gul Moonis; Anna Nordvig; Jonathan Overdevest; Morgan Prust; Serge Przedborski; William Roth; Allison Soung; Kurenai Tanji; Andrew Teich; Dritan Agalliu; Anne-Catrin Uhlemann; James E.

At 4 months after hospitalization, fibrotic ILA was more common in those who underwent mechanical ventilation (72%) than in those who did not (20%). We demonstrate that severity of initial illness, duration of mechanical ventilation, lactate dehydrogenase on admission, and leukocyte telomere length are independent risk factors for fibrotic ILA.

84,Exploring causal relationships between COVID-19 and cardiometabolic disorders: A bi-directional Mendelian randomization study,"BackgroundMore than 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. A number of risk factors for infection or severe infection have been identified, however observational studies were subject to confounding bias. In addition, there is still limited knowledge about the complications or medical consequences of the disease.

MethodsHere we performed bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate causal relationships between liability to COVID-19 (and severe/critical infection) and a wide range of around 30 cardiometabolic disorders (CMD) or traits. Genetic correlation (rg) was assessed by LD score regression(LDSC). The latest GWAS summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative was used, which comprised comparisons of general population controls with critically ill, hospitalized and any infected cases.

ResultsOverall we observed evidence that liability to COVID-19 or severe infection may be causally associated with higher risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM), chronic kidney disease(CKD), ischemic stroke (especially large artery stroke[LAS]) and heart failure(HF) when compared to the general population. On the other hand, our findings suggested that liability to atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke (especially LAS), obesity, diabetes (T1DM and T2DM), low insulin sensitivity and impaired renal function (low eGFR and diabetic kidney disease) may be causal risk factors for COVID-19 or severe disease. In genetic correlation analysis, T2DM, CAD, obesity, fasting insulin, CKD, gout, stroke and urate showed positive rg with critical or hospitalized infection. All above findings passed multiple testing correction at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05.

ConclusionsIn summary, this study provides evidence for tentative bi-directional causal associations between liability to COVID-19 and severe disease and a number of CM disorders.

We measured antibody-mediated neutralization of spike protein-ACE2 receptor binding--a surrogate measure of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection--in a large and diverse community-based seroprevalence study. Comparisons were made across three groups of seropositive participants that differed in the severity of infection and engagement with clinical care (N=790). The clinical group was seropositive for prior infection, symptomatic, and diagnosed with COVID-19 by a healthcare provider. The symptomatic group was seropositive and reported one or more symptoms of infection but received no clinical care. The asymptomatic group was seropositive but reported no symptoms. 86.2% of all infections were mild or asymptomatic; 13.8% received clinical care. Of the clinical cases, 96.3% were outpatient; only 3.7% required hospitalization. Moderate or high levels of neutralizing activity were detected following 27.5% of clinical infections, in comparison with 5.4% of symptomatic and 1.5% of asymptomatic infections. The majority of infections in the general population are mild or asymptomatic and likely result in low levels of antibody-mediated protective immunity.",Thomas W. McDade; Amelia Sancilio; Richard T.

We investigated 140 COVID-19 patients from diagnosis to convalescence using clinical data, viral load assessments, and multi-omic analyses of blood plasma and circulating immune cells. Immune-phenotype dynamics resolved four recovery trajectories. One trajectory signals a return to pre-infection healthy baseline, while the other three are characterized by differing fractions of persistent cytotoxic and proliferative T cells, distinct B cell maturation processes, and memory-like innate immunity. We resolve a small panel of plasma proteins that, when measured at diagnosis, can predict patient survival and recovery-trajectory commitment.

87,Analysis of Thrombotic Adverse Reactions of COVID-19 AstraZeneca Vaccine reported to EudraVigilance database,"The development of safe, effective, affordable vaccines against COVID-19 remains the cornerstone to mitigating this pandemic. Early December 2020, multiple research groups had designed potential vaccines. From 11 March 2021, several European countries temporarily suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine amid reports of blood clot events and death of a vaccinated person, despite the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization assurance that there was no indication that vaccination was linked. This study aimed to identify and analyse the thrombotic adverse reactions associated with Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. This was a retrospective descriptive study using spontaneous reports submitted to the EudraVigilance database in the period from 17 February to 12 March 2021. There were 54,571 adverse reaction reports of which 28 were associated with thrombotic adverse reactions. Three fatalities were related to Pulmonary Embolism; 1 fatality to Thrombosis. With 17 million people having had the AstraZeneca vaccine, these are extremely rare events. The EMAs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (18 March 2021) concluded that the vaccine was safe, effective and the benefits outweighed the risks.

88,"COVID-19 IN IRAQ, THE RURAL INITIATION (AL-MUTHANNA PROVINCE AS AN EXAMPLE)","A sustained pneumonia outbreak associated with a novel coronavirus named acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 which was later called COVID-19. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Najaf/ Iraq on 24th February. This paper provided some information on COVID-19 infection in the Province of Al-Muthanna / South Iraq, which was then statistically analyzed and concluded. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections were reported by the Iraqi Ministry of Health in the Province of Al-Muthanna. The first foci started and the first dead infected individual was from Hilal which refers mainly to the role or rural places in starting and transmission of COVID-19 in Iraq. Many of the infections resulted in non-traveling persons because they were contaminated by contact (96%). Therefore, contact is perceived to be the best-recognized form of transmission. It was also reported that infections in Soweir District of Samawah City were the highest (45%) compared to other areas of the region. They should also be observed, however, that the steps to enforce and monitor the curfew are directly related to the direction of the City Centre, because the more they drive away from the city centers, the less stringent the procedures. Infections were focused between the ages of 20 and 50 years old, as that is the expected result, because these ranges are at the core of active age groups including social and sports events.

90,SARS-CoV-2 show no infectivity at later stages in a prolonged COVID-19 patient despite positivity in RNA testing,"Inpatient COVID-19 cases present enormous costs to patients and health systems. Many hospitalized patients may still test COVID-19 positive, even after resolution of symptoms. Thus, a pressing concern for clinicians is the safety of discharging these asymptomatic patients if they have any remaining infectivity. This case report explores the viral viability in a patient with persistent COVID-19 over the course of a two-month hospitalization. Positive nasopharyngeal swab samples, analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), were collected and isolated in the laboratory, and infectious doses were analyzed throughout the hospitalization period. The patient experienced waning symptoms by hospital day 40 and had no viable virus growth in the laboratory by hospital day 41, suggesting no risk of infectivity, despite positive RT-PCR results, which prolonged his hospital stay. Notably, this case showed infectivity for at least 24 days from disease onset, which is longer than the discontinuation of transmission-based precautions recommendation by CDC. Thus, our findings suggest that the timeline for discontinuing transmission-based precautions may need to be extended for patients with prolonged illness.

To profile genetic variants, we developed and clinically validated a hybridization capture SARS-CoV-2 NGS assay, integrating novel methods for panel design using dsDNA biotin-labeled probes, and built accompanying software. The positive and negative percent agreement were defined in comparison to an orthogonal RT-PCR assay (PPA and NPA: both 96.7%). The limit of detection was established to be 800 copies/ml with an average fold-enrichment of 46,791x. We identified novel 107 mutations, including 24 in the functionally-important spike protein. Further, we profiled the full nasopharyngeal microbiome using metagenomics and found overrepresentation of 7 taxa and macrolide resistance in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. This hybrid capture NGS assay, coupled with optimized software, is a powerful approach to detect and comprehensively map SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants for tracking viral evolution and guiding vaccine updates.

For decades, C4R cohorts have collected extensive data on clinical and subclinical diseases and their risk factors, including behavior, cognition, biomarkers, and social determinants of health. C4R will link this pre-COVID phenotyping to information on SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute and post-acute COVID-related illness.

93,Data-driven estimate of SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity threshold in populations with individual contact pattern variations,"The development of efficacious vaccines has made it possible to envision mass vaccination programs aimed at suppressing SARS-CoV-2 transmission around the world. Here we use a data-driven age-structured multilayer representation of the population of 34 countries to estimate the disease induced immunity threshold, accounting for the contact variability across individuals. We show that the herd immunization threshold of random (un-prioritized) mass vaccination programs is generally larger than the disease induced immunity threshold. We use the model to test two additional vaccine prioritization strategies, transmission-focused and age-based, in which individuals are inoculated either according to their behavior (number of contacts) or infection fatality risk, respectively. Our results show that in the case of a sterilizing vaccine the behavioral strategy achieves herd-immunity at a coverage comparable to the disease-induced immunity threshold, but it appears to have inferior performance in averting deaths than the risk vaccination strategy. The presented results have potential use in defining the effects that the heterogeneity of social mixing and contact patterns has on herd immunity levels and the deployment of vaccine prioritization strategies.",Dan Lu; Alberto Aleta; Marco Ajelli; Romualdo Pastor-Satorras; Alessandro Vespignani; Yamir Moreno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253974,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253974,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
94,A convergence based assessment of relative differences in age-stratified susceptibility and infectiousness for SARS-CoV-2 variants of B.1.1.7 lineage,"We propose (a) a method for aggregating and processing age-stratified subregional time series data for positive tests of infection given partial sampling for variant-of-concern biomarkers, and (b) a simple model-based theoretical framework for interpreting these processed data, to assess whether observed heterogeneity in age-specific relative differences can be explained by environmental effects alone.

We then apply this strategy to public-domain subregional time series data with S-gene target failure (SGTF) sampling as a proxy for B.1.1.7 lineage, from weeks 45 to 50 of 2020 from England. For the time period in question, we observe convergence toward a 1.27 (95% CI 1.17-1.38) times higher ratio of SGTF to non-SGTF infection for 0-9-year-olds than for the total population, and a 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.23) times higher ratio for 10-19-year-olds. These are roughly comparable to previous findings, but this time we find high-significance evidence for adequate compatibility with our proposed modelling framework criteria to conclude that these relative elevations for 0-19-year-olds are very unlikely to be explained by environmental effects alone. We also find possible indications that 0-19-year-olds might experience a higher relative increase in infectiousness than susceptibility for B.1.1.7.",Sarah Dean Rasmussen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253931,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253931,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
95,Prevalence and determinants of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the general population of the Gardena Valley,"BackgroundCommunity-based studies are essential to quantify the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and for unbiased characterization of its determinants and outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Gardena valley, a major Alpine touristic destination which was struck in the expansion phase of the COVID-19 pandemic over the winter 2020.

MethodsWe surveyed 2244 representative study participants who underwent swab and serum antibody tests. We made multiple comparisons among the Abbott and Diasorin bioassays and serum neutralization titers. Seroprevalence accounted for the stratified design, non-response and test accuracy. Determinants and symptoms predictive of infection were analyzed by weighted multiple logistic regression.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 26.9% (95% confidence interval: 25.2%, 28.6%) by June 2020. The serum antibody bioassays had modest agreement with each other. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the serum neutralizing capacity showed better performance of the Abbott test at lower than the canonical threshold. Socio-demographic characteristics showed no clear evidence of association with seropositivity, which was instead associated with place of residence and economic activity. Loss of taste or smell, fever, difficulty in breathing, pain in the limbs, and weakness were the most predictive symptoms of positive antibody test results. Fever and weakness associations were age-dependent.

ConclusionThe Gardena valley had one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in Europe.

96,Accuracy of Computable Phenotyping Approaches for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Hospitalizations from the Electronic Health Record,"ObjectiveReal-world data, including administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data, have been critical for rapid-knowledge generation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Many studies relied on these data to identify cases and ascertain outcomes., commonly using diagnostic codes. However, to ensure high-quality results are delivered to guide clinical decision making, guide the public health response, and characterize the response to interventions, it is essential to establish the accuracy of these approaches for case identification of infections and hospitalizations.

MethodsReal-world EHR data were obtained from the clinical data warehouse and computational health platform at a large academic health system that includes 5 regional hospitals in Connecticut and Rhode Island and their associated ambulatory practices. Demographic information, diagnosis codes, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and antigen testing results, and visit data including discharge disposition were obtained from our OMOP common data model for all patients with either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or ICD-10 diagnosis of COVID-19 (U07.1) between April 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021. Various computable phenotype definitions using combinations of test results and diagnostic codes were evaluated for their accuracy to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalizations. The association with each phenotype was further compared with case volumes and, for hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality. We conducted a quantitative assessment with a manual chart review for a sample of 40 patients who had discordance between diagnostic code and laboratory result findings.

ResultsThere were 69,423 individuals with either a diagnosis code or a laboratory diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 61,023 individuals had a principal or a secondary diagnosis code for COVID-19 and 50,355 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test. Among those with a positive PCR, 38,506 (76.5%) also had a principal and 3449 (6.8%) a secondary diagnosis of COVID-19, but 8400 (16.7%) had no COVID-19 diagnosis in the medical record. Moreover, of the 61,023 patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis, 19,068 (31.2%) did not have a positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 in the EHR. In a manual chart review of this sample of patients, we found that these many had a COVID-19 diagnosis code added during healthcare encounters related to asymptomatic testing, either as part of a screening program or following exposure, but with negative subsequent test results. The positive predictive value (precision) and sensitivity (recall) of a COVID-19 diagnosis in the medical record for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were 68.8% and 83.3%, respectively. Further, among 5,109 patients who were hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of COVID-19, 4843 (94.8%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test within the 2 weeks preceding hospital admission or during hospitalization. In a random sample of 10 without a positive test during the index hospitalization selected for manual chart review, 7 (70.0%) had been tested at an outside laboratory before admission and the remaining had a strong clinical suspicion for COVID-19. In addition, 789 hospitalizations had a secondary diagnosis of COVID-19, of which 446 (56.5%) had a principal diagnosis that was consistent with severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 (e.g., sepsis or respiratory failure). Compared with the cohort that had a principal diagnosis of COVID-19, those with a secondary diagnosis more frequently male and White and had more than 2-fold higher in-hospital mortality (13.2% vs 28.0%, P<0.001).

ConclusionsIn a large integrated health system, COVID-19 diagnosis codes were not adequate for case identification and epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, a principal diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis consistently identified hospitalized patients with the disease but missed nearly 10% of cases that presented with more severe manifestations of disease and had over 2-fold higher mortality. Data from the EHR can provide additional data elements compared to administrative claims alone, such as laboratory testing results, that can be used to in conjunction with diagnostic codes to create more fine-tuned phenotypes that are designed for specific analytical use cases.",Rohan Khera; Bobak Mortazavi; Veer Sangha; Frederick Warner; H Patrick Young; Joseph S Ross; Nilay D Shah; Benjamin D Pollock; Karen Wang; Cynthia A Brandt; Zhenqiu Lin; Harlan M Krumholz; Wade L Schulz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253770,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253770,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
97,Adapting French COVID-19 vaccination campaign duration to variant dissemination,"BackgroundThe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a major international health crisis with serious consequences in terms of public health and economy. In France, two lockdown periods were decided in 2020 to avoid the saturation of intensive care units (ICU) and an increase in mortality. The rapid dissemination of variant SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 has strongly influenced the course of the epidemic. Vaccines have been rapidly developed. Their efficacy against the severe forms of the disease has been established, and their efficacy against disease transmission is under evaluation. The aim of this paper is to compare the efficacy of several vaccination strategies in the presence of variants in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic through population immunity.

MethodsAn agent-based model was designed to simulate with different scenarios the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in France over 2021 and 2022. The simulations were carried out ignoring the occurrence of variants then taking into account their diffusion over time. The expected effects of three Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (Relaxed-NPI, Intensive-NPI, and Extended-NPI) to limit the epidemic extension were compared. The expected efficacy of vaccines were the values recently estimated in preventing severe forms of the disease (75% and 94%) for the current used vaccines in France (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna since January 11, 2021, and AstraZeneca since February 2, 2021). All vaccination campaigns reproduced an advanced age-based priority advised by the Haute Autorite de Sante. Putative reductions of virus transmission were fixed at 0, 50, 75 and 90%. The effects of four vaccination campaign durations (6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month) were compared.

ResultsIn the absence of vaccination, the presence of variants led to reject the Relaxed-NPI because of a high expected number of deaths (170 to 210 thousands) and the significant overload of ICUs from which 35 thousand patients would be deprived. In comparison with the situation without vaccination, the number of deaths was divided by 7 without ICU saturation with a 6-month vaccination campaign. A 12-month campaign would divide the number of death by 3 with Intensive-NPI and by 6 with Extended-NPI (the latter being necessary to avoid ICU saturation). With 18-month and 24-month vaccination campaigns without Extended-NPI, the number of deaths and ICU admissions would explode.

ConclusionAmong the four compared strategies the 6-month vaccination campaign seems to be the best response to changes in the dynamics of the epidemic due to the variants. The race against the COVID-19 epidemic is a race of vaccination strategy. Any further vaccination delay would increase the need of strengthened measures such as Extended-NPI to limit the number of deaths and avoid ICU saturation.",Simon Pageaud; Nicolas Ponthus; Romain Gauchon; Catherine Pothier; Christophe Rigotti; Anne Eyraud-Loisel; Jean-Pierre Bertoglio; Alexis Bienven&uumle; Fran&ccedilois Gueyffier; Philippe Vanhems; Nicolas Leboisne; Jean Iwaz; St&eacutephane Loisel; Pascal Roy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253739,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253739,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
98,Modelling the population-level protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccination,"Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines work predominantly by eliciting neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), how the protection they confer depends on the NAb response to vaccination is unclear. Here, we collated and analysed in vitro dose-response curves of >70 NAbs and constructed a landscape defining the spectrum of neutralization efficiencies of NAbs elicited. We mimicked responses of individuals by sampling NAb subsets of known sizes from the landscape and found that they recapitulated responses of convalescent patients. Combining individual responses with a mathematical model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination, we predicted how the population-level protection conferred would increase with the NAb response to vaccination. Our predictions captured the outcomes of vaccination trials. Our formalism may help optimize vaccination protocols, given limited vaccine availability.

99,Investigation of the ventilation situation in a lecture room of building 033 at the Universität der Bundeswehr München,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is limiting both the private and public lives of many people around the world. It is now considered certain that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets, smear infection, and aerosol particles. While simple masks, spacing, and hand hygiene significantly reduce the risk of infection via the first two routes mentioned, the risk from aerosol particles remains. These small particles move with the air in the room and spread unhindered throughout it. To reduce the risk of infection from viruses present in aerosol particles, the following options exist. First, good respiratory masks can be worn to reduce the viral load in the inhaled air. Another option is to make the viruses harmless (e.g., by UV light). A third option is to reduce the viral load in the room by bringing in virus-free air and moving contaminated air out or cleaning the air in the room. To investigate how well virus load reduction via ventilation works in a real lecture room, measurements were carried out at the Universitat der Bundeswehr Munchen (University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich). The lecture room holds a maximum of approx. 90 people and has a ventilation system as well as 2 windows that can be opened. In the absence of a ventilation system in a comparable room, the effectiveness of a room air cleaner was also investigated.",Christian J.

100,Return to normal: COVID-19 vaccination under mitigation measures,"Being unable to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the majority of countries worldwide have resorted to a mitigation approach towards COVID-19, allowing some degree of viral circulation in the population. Here, we investigate the expected outcomes of the interplay between vaccination rollout and adaptive mitigation measures constantly altering the epidemic trajectory and keeping the reproduction number around the unit. Using a novel mathematical modeling framework, we estimate that, for vaccination capacities of at least 4 daily doses administered per 1,000 inhabitants, a complete release of mitigation measures can be expected within 7 to 13 months since the start of vaccination, with a two-year cumulative incidence of deaths between 0.18 and 0.46 per 1,000 population. A heavier burden of deaths and a delayed ""return-to-normal"" is expected for lower vaccine capacities, if viral transmissibility exceeds by >60% the one estimated at the beginning of the pandemic, or if vaccine protection is short-lived. Failure to prioritize the elderly or a premature release of mitigation measures after vaccination of the most fragile will conspicuously increase the expected mortality. Finally, strategies oriented to prioritize the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 by maintaining strict restrictions will take a similar time as a mitigation approach, possibly resulting in acceptability issues. Persisting unknowns about the evolving epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 variants and on the effectiveness of available and upcoming vaccines may warrant a future reassessment of these conclusions.",Valentina Marziano; Giorgio Guzzetta; Alessia Mammone; Flavia Riccardo; Piero Poletti; Filippo Trentini; Mattia Manica; Andrea Siddu; Paola Stefanelli; Patrizio Pezzotti; Marco Ajelli; Silvio Brusaferro; Giovanni Rezza; Stefano Merler,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253893,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253893,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True

We conducted an online survey among adults in Puerto Rico to identify factors associated with intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. Sociodemographic variables were analyzed independently for association with intention to vaccinate. Significant associations were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 1016 responses were available for analysis. In the bivariate analysis, younger age, higher education, pre-covid employment, male sex, gay/bisexual identity, and single marital status were associated with increased intention to vaccinate. In the multivariate logistic regression, younger, male respondents who had higher educational attainment reported higher intention to vaccinate. Lower-income and living outside the San Juan metro region were associated with lower intention to vaccinate. National and international health organizations were identified as the most reliable sources of information, followed by healthcare professionals.

102,"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a mathematical modelling analysis","The worldwide endeavour to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has been extraordinary, and vaccination is now underway in many countries. However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extended a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identified optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We found that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for <20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.

HighlightsO_LIThe global dose supply of COVID-19 vaccines will be constrained in 2021

103,Risk of reinfection after seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2: A population-based propensity-score matched cohort study,"ImportanceSerological assays detecting specific IgG antibodies generated against the Spike protein following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are being widely deployed in research studies and clinical practice. However, the duration and the effectiveness of the protection conferred by the immune response against future infection remains to be assessed in a large population.

ObjectiveTo estimate the incidence of newly acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in seropositive individuals from a population-based sample as compared to seronegative controls.

DesignRetrospective longitudinal propensity-score matched cohort study.

SettingA seroprevalence survey including a population-based representative sample of the population from the canton of Geneva (Switzerland) was conducted between April and June 2020, immediately after the first pandemic wave. Each individual included in the seroprevalence survey was linked to a state centralized registry compiling virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections since the beginning of the pandemic.

ParticipantsParticipants aged twelve years old and over, who developed anti-spike IgG antibodies were matched one-to-two to seronegative controls, using a propensity-score including age, gender, immunodeficiency, body mass index, smoking status and education level.

ExposureSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.

Main outcomes and measuresOur primary outcome was virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections which occurred from serological status assessment in April-June 2020 to the end of the second pandemic wave (January 2021). Additionally, incidence of infections, rate of testing and proportion of positive tests were analysed.

ResultsAmong 8344 serosurvey participants, 498 seropositive individuals were selected and matched with 996 seronegative controls. After a mean follow-up of 35.6 (Standard Deviation, SD: 3.2) weeks, 7 out of 498 (1.4%) seropositive subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, of which 5 (1.0%) were considered as reinfections. By contrast, infection rate was significantly higher in seronegative individuals (15.5%, 154/996) during a similar mean follow-up of 34.7 (SD 3.2) weeks, corresponding to a 94% (95%CI 86% to 98%, P<0.001) reduction in the hazard of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for seropositive subjects.

Conclusions and relevanceSeroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection to successive viral contamination lasting at least 8 months. These findings could help global health authorities establishing priority for vaccine allocation.

104,"Modelling the impact of rapid tests, tracing and distancing in lower-income countries suggest optimal policies varies with rural-urban settings","BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) remains the most reliable COVID-19 containment tool for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) given the inequality of vaccine distribution and their vulnerable healthcare systems. We aimed to develop mathematical models that capture LMIC demographic characteristics such as young population and large household size and assess NPI effectiveness in rural and urban communities.

MethodsWe constructed synthetic populations for rural, non-slum urban and slum settings to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. We integrated age mixing and household structure into contact networks for each community setting and simulated COVID-19 outbreaks within the networks. Using this agent-based model, we evaluate NPIs including testing and isolation, tracing and quarantine, and physical distancing. We explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic test, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. We performed extensive simulations to capture the uncertainty of outbreak trajectories and the impact of varying model parameters.

FindingsWe found the impact of testing, tracing and distancing varies with rural-urban settings. In rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. Additionally, antibody rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based diagnosis could be useful for mitigating the transmission. In non-slum urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In slum communities, we found physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and non-slum urban communities. Lastly, for all communities considered, we demonstrated contact quarantine is essential for effective containment and is effective at a low compliance rate (30%).

InterpretationOur findings could guide setting-specific strategy design for different communities in LMICs.

105,"Importation, circulation, and emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the South Indian State of Karnataka","As the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 continues, the selection of genomic variants which can influence how the pandemic progresses is of growing concern. Of particular concern, are those variants that carry mutations/amino acid changes conferring higher transmission, more severe disease, re-infection, and immune escape. These can broadly be classified as Variants of Concern (VOCs). VOCs have been reported from several parts of the world- UK (lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (lineage B.1.351) and, Brazil (lineage P.1/B.1.1.28). The conditions that contribute to the emergence of VOCs are not well understood. International travel remains an important means of spread. To track importation, spread, and the emergence of variants locally; we sequenced whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from international travellers (n=75) entering Karnataka, a state in South India, between Dec 22, 2020- Jan 31, 2021, and from positive cases in the city of Bengaluru (n=108), between Nov 22, 2020- Jan 22, 2021. The resulting 176 SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be classified into 34 lineages, that were either imported (73/176) or circulating (103/176) in this time period. The lineage B.1.1.7 (a.k.a the UK variant) was the major lineage imported into the state (24/73, 32.9%), followed by B.1.36 (20/73, 27.4%) and B.1 (14/73, 19.2%). We identified B.1.36 (45/103; 43.7%), B.1 (26/103; 25.2%), B.1.1.74 (5/103; 4.9%) and B.1.468 (4/103; 3.9%) as the major variants circulating in Bengaluru city. A distinct clade within the B.1.36 lineage was associated with a local outbreak. Analysis of the complete genomes predicted multiple amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. In total, we identified nine amino acid changes (singly or in pairs) in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike protein. Of these, the amino acid replacement N440K was found in 37/65 (56.92%) sequences in the B.1.36 lineage. The E484K amino acid change which is present in both VOCs, B.1.351 and P.1/B.1.1.28, was found in a single circulating virus in the B.1.36 lineage. This study highlights the introduction of VOCs by travel and the local circulation of viruses with amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. These were spread across lineages, suggesting that multiple paths can lead to the emergence of VOCs, this, in turn, highlights the need to sequence and limit outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 locally. Our data support the use of concentrated and continued genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to direct public health measures, suggest revisions to vaccines, and serve as an early warning system to prepare for a surge in COVID-19 cases.",Chitra Pattabiraman; Pramada Prasad; Anson K George; Darshan Sreenivas; Risha Rasheed; Nakka Vijay Kiran Reddy; Anita Desai; Ravi Vasanthapuram,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253810,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253810,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
106,Effect of information about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and side effects on behavioural intentions: two online experiments,"The success of mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns rests on widespread uptake. However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication--including uncertainty--about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2,097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2,217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g. social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.",John R.

107,"Neurological manifestations of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 attending a public hospital in Lima, Peru","ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence and characteristics of the most common neurological manifestations in Peruvian patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a single-center prospective, cross-sectional study at an isolation center functioning as a public acute-care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lima, the capital city of Peru. This was a convenience sample of patients with acute COVID-19 infection and mild-to-moderate respiratory symptoms who presented for hospital admission between September 25 and November 25, 2020. We interviewed participants and collected demographic, medical history and clinical presentation data; all participants underwent a complete physical and neurological examination. Descriptive statistics and prevalence ratios (PR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values were calculated to explore between-groups differences.

ResultsOf 199 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 enrolled in this study, 83% presented with at least one neurological symptom (mean symptom duration 8 +/-6 days). The most common neurological symptoms were headache (72%), hypogeusia or ageusia (41%), hyposmia or anosmia (40%) and dizziness (34%). Only 2.5% of the cohort had an abnormal neurological examination. The majority (42%) had no prior comorbidities. Presence of at least 1 neurological symptom was independently associated with fever, dyspnea, cough, poor appetite, sore throat, chest tightness or diarrhea, but not with comorbid conditions.

ConclusionsThis cross-sectional study found that headaches, and smell and taste dysfunction are common among patients presenting with mild-to-moderate acute COVID-19 in Lima, Peru. International longitudinal studies are needed to determine the long-term neurological sequelae of COVID-19 during the acute and post-infectious period.",Marco H.

108,The effect of Covid-19 isolation measures on the cognition and mental health of people living with dementia: a rapid systematic review of one year of evidence.,"BackgroundCovid-19 control policies have entailed lockdowns and confinement. Although these isolation measures are thought to be particularly hard and possibly harmful to people with dementia, their specific impact during the pandemic has not yet been synthesised. We aimed to examine and summarise the global research evidence describing the effect of Covid-19 isolation measures on the health of people living with dementia.

MethodWe searched Pubmed, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to February 2021 for peer-reviewed quantitative studies of the effects of isolation measures during Covid-19 on cognitive, psychological and functional symptoms of people with any kind of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. We summarised the findings of included papers following current guidelines for rapid reviews.

ResultsWe identified 15 eligible papers, examining a total of 6,442 people with dementia. 13/15 were conducted in people living in the community and 2 in care homes. 60% (9/15) studies reported changes in cognition with 77% (7/9) of them describing declined cognition by >50% of respondents. 93% (14/15) of studies reported worsening or new onset of behavioural and psychological symptoms. 46% (7/15) studies reported changes in daily function, 6 of them reporting a functional decline in a variable proportion of the population studied.

ConclusionLockdowns and confinement measures brought about by the pandemic have damaged the cognitive and psychological health and functional abilities of people with dementia across the world. It is urgent that infection control measures applied to people with dementia are balanced against the principles of non-maleficence. This systematic review makes 4 specific calls for action.

Key PointsO_LINeuropsychiatric symptoms of people with dementia (e.g., anxiety, depressive symptoms, apathy, agitation) were found to worsen during lockdown in the majority of studies.
C_LIO_LICognitive decline affecting memory, orientation concentration and communication was observed by caregivers within few weeks after lockdown.
C_LIO_LIThe deterioration reported occurred in a short window of time (between 1 and 4 months) and it is unlikely to be attributable to the natural variation of the course of dementia.
C_LIO_LIThere is little research conducted in care home residents with dementia (only 2 papers found).
C_LIO_LIIncrease consumption of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines has occurred in people with dementia during lockdown.
C_LIO_LIEvidence indicates that isolation measures quickly damaged peoples with dementia cognitive and mental health and probably accelerated overall decline.

109,"PREDICTIVE IMMUNOLOGICAL, VIROLOGICAL, AND ROUTINE LABORATORY MARKERS FOR CRITICAL COVID-19 ON ADMISSION.Immunocovid study","IntroductionEarly identification of COVID-19 patients at risk of critical illness is challenging for clinicians. Immunological, virological, and routine laboratory markers to be used in addition to clinical data are needed.

Aim and methodsBlood tests to measure neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), levels of ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, complement components (C3, C4), lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines, and SARS-Cov2 RT-PCR tests were performed in COVID-19 confirmed cases within 48 hours of admission. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined by RT-PCR from oral or nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of admission. Severity of symptoms was categorized as mild (grade 1), severe (grade 2), and critical (grade 3).

Results120 patients were included. COVID-19 was mild in 49, severe in 32, and critical in 39. Ferritin >370 ng/mL (OR 16.4, 95% CI 5.3-50.8), D-dimer >440 ng/mL (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36-12.61), CRP >7.65 mg/dL (OR 11.54, 95% CI 4.3-30.8), NLR >3.77 (OR 13.4, 95% CI 4.3-41.1), IL-6 >142.5 pg/mL (OR 8.76, 95% CI 3.56-21.54), IL-10 >10.8 pg/mL (OR 16.45, 95% CI 5.32-50.81), sIL-2r (sCD25) >804.5 pg/mL (OR 14.06, 95% CI 4.56-43.28), IL-1Ra >88.4 pg/mL (OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.03-10.17), and IL-18 >144 pg/mL (OR 17.85, 95% CI 6.54-48.78) were associated with critical COVID-19 in the univariate age-adjusted analysis. In the multivariate age-adjusted analysis, this association was confirmed only for ferritin, CRP,NLR, IL-10, sIL-2r, and IL-18. T, B, and NK cells were significantly decreased in critical patients. SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in blood except in 3 patients with indeterminate results. Ct values determined by RT-PCR from oral/nasopharyngeal swabs on admission were not related to symptom severity.

110,Network-based Modeling of COVID-19 Dynamics: Early Pandemic Spread in India,"Modeling the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic spread is a challenging and relevant problem. Established models for the epidemic spread such as compartmental epidemiological models e.g. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models and its variants, have been discussed extensively in the literature and utilized to forecast the growth of the pandemic across different hot-spots in the world. The standard formulations of SIR models rely upon summary-level data, which may not be able to fully capture the complete dynamics of the pandemic growth. Since the disease spreads from carriers to susceptible individuals via some form of contact, it inherently relies upon a network of individuals for its growth, with edges established via direct interaction, such as shared physical proximity. Using individual-level COVID-19 data from the early days (January 30 to April 15, 2020) of the pandemic in India, and under a network-based SIR model framework, we performed state-specific forecasting under multiple scenarios characterized by the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across 34 Indian states and union territories. We validated our short-term projections using observed case counts and the long-term projections using national sero-survey findings. Based on healthcare availability data, we also performed projections to assess the burdens on the infrastructure along the spectrum of the pandemic growth. We have developed an interactive dashboard summarizing our results. Our predictions successfully identified the initial hot-spots of India such as Maharashtra and Delhi, and those that emerged later, such as Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. These models have the potential to inform appropriate policies for isolation and mitigation strategies to contain the pandemic, through a phased approach by appropriate resource prioritization and allocation.",Rupam Bhattacharyya; Sayantan Banerjee; Shariq Mohammed; Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253772,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253772,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True

112,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical procedures in Brazil: a descriptive study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected medical practice, and changes in healthcare activities were needed to minimize the overload and avoid healthcare systems collapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on surgical procedures in Brazil.

Materials and MethodsWe conducted a descriptive study of the number of hospitalizations for surgical procedures in Brazil from 2016 to 2020. Data were collected from the Brazilian Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS). Analyzes were performed according to the type of procedure, geographical region, subgroups of surgical procedures, and the number of surgeries from 2020 were compared with the average from 2016 to 2019.

ResultsThere were 4,009,116 hospitalizations for surgical procedures in the Brazilian Public Health System in 2020. When comparing it to the average of hospitalizations from 2016-2019, there was a decrease of 14.88% [95%IC (14.82-14.93)]. Decrease rates were 34.82% [95%IC (34.73-34.90)] for elective procedures and 1.11% [95%IC (1.07-1.13)] for urgent procedures. Decrease rates were similar in all the five regions of the country (average 14.17%). Surgical procedure subgroups with the highest decrease rates were endocrine gland surgery (48.03%), breast surgery (40.68%), oral and maxillofacial surgery (37.03%), surgery of the upper airways, face, head and neck (36.06%), and minor surgeries and surgeries of skin, subcutaneous tissue and mucosa (33.16%). Conclusion: The overload of healthcare facilities has demanded a reduction of non-urgent activities to prevent a collapse of healthcare systems, resulting in a decrease in elective surgeries. Recommendations about the performance of surgical procedures were made, and continuous refinements of these recommendations are encouraged.",Barbara Okabaiasse Luizeti; Victor Augusto Santos Perli; Gabriel da Costa; Igor Eckert; Aluisio Marino Roma; Karina Miura da Costa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253801,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253801,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
113,Homophily in risk and behavior complicate understanding the COVID-19 epidemic curve,"New COVID-19 diagnoses have dropped faster than expected in the United States. Interpretations of the decrease have focused on changing factors (e.g. mask-wearing, vaccines, etc.), but predictive models largely ignore heterogeneity in behaviorally-driven exposure risks among distinct groups. We present a simplified compartmental model with differential mixing in two behaviorally distinct groups. We show how homophily in behavior, risk, and exposure can lead to early peaks and rapid declines that critically do not signal the end of the outbreak. Instead, higher exposure risk groups may more rapidly exhaust available susceptibles while the lower risk group are still in a (slower) growth phase of their outbreak curve. This simplified model demonstrates that complex incidence curves, such as those currently seen in the US, can be generated without changes to fundamental drivers of disease dynamics. Correct interpretation of incidence curves will be critical for policy decisions to effectively manage the pandemic.",Nina H Fefferman; Matthew J Silk; Dana K Pasquale; James Moody,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253708,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253708,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
114,Monitoring the propagation of SARS CoV2 variants by tracking identified mutation in wastewater using specific RT-qPCR,"Since the end of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has experienced a major turning point with the appearance and rapid spread of new variants, causing a significant increase in the number of new cases requiring hospitalization. These so-called UK, South African or Brazilian variants are characterized by combinations of mutations which allow them to be distinguished from the variants which have circulated since the start of the epidemic. The impact of these variants on the functioning of healthcare systems requires monitoring the spread of these variants, which are more contagious, more lethal and may reinfect people who are already immune to a natural infection or to a vaccination. Monitoring the viral genome in wastewater has shown great value in early detection of the dynamics of virus spreading in populations.

The sequencing of viral genomes is used in humans, but its application and interpretation on wastewater matrices are much more complex due to the diversity of circulating strains. Also this study demonstrates the possibility of following certain mutations found in these new variants by targeted RT-qPCR.

115,Mental health of patients with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: A questionnaire-based survey weighted for attrition,"ImportanceIndividuals with pre-existing mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the negative impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic seems to have on mental health. Most prior studies on this topic are limited by non-random sampling, lacking information on non-respondents, and self-reporting of mental illness. In the present study, we aimed to overcome these limitations via random sampling, acquisition of clinical and sociodemographic data on both respondents and non-respondents, and weighting of results informed by attrition.

ObjectiveTo assess whether patients with mental illness experienced deterioration in mental health during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown of Denmark in the Spring of 2020.

DesignA cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey coupled with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees. The latter enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results.

SettingThe psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region.

ParticipantsA total of 992 randomly drawn patients diagnosed with mental illness in the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region prior to the lockdown responded to the online survey (response rate of 21.6%).

ExposureThe four-week nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 11 to April 15, 2020).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe online questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in symptoms during the lockdown using the pre-pandemic period as reference. Perceived reasons for deterioration of mental health were also reported.

ResultsThe weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 28, respectively. A total of 52% of the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during the lockdown, while 33% reported no change, and 16% reported improvement. The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration were loneliness, disruption of routines, concerns about coronavirus, less frequent contact with family/friends, boredom, and reduced access to psychiatric care.

Conclusion and RelevanceMore than half of the patients with mental illness reported worsening of their mental health during the pandemic lockdown. There should be increased emphasis on ensuring both social and clinical support for individuals with mental illness during pandemics.

116,Intensity of COVID-19 in care homes following Hospital Discharge in the early stages of the UK epidemic,"BackgroundA defining feature of the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries was the tragic extent to which care home residents were affected, and the difficulty preventing introduction and subsequent spread of infection. Management of risk in care homes requires good evidence on the most important transmission pathways. One hypothesised route at the start of the pandemic, prior to widespread testing, was transfer of patients from hospitals, which were experiencing high levels of nosocomial events.

MethodsWe tested the hypothesis that hospital discharge events increased the intensity of care home cases using a national individually linked health record cohort in Wales, UK. We monitored 186,772 hospital discharge events over the period March to July 2020, tracking individuals to 923 care homes and recording the daily case rate in the homes populated by 15,772 residents. We estimated the risk of an increase in cases rates following exposure to a hospital discharge using multi-level hierarchical logistic regression, and a novel stochastic Hawkes process outbreak model.

FindingsIn regression analysis, after adjusting for care home size, we found no significant association between hospital discharge and subsequent increases in care home case numbers (odds ratio: 0.99, 95% CI 0.82, 1.90). Risk factors for increased cases included care home size, care home resident density, and provision of nursing care. Using our outbreak model, we found a significant effect of hospital discharge on the subsequent intensity of cases. However, the effect was small, and considerably less than the effect of care home size, suggesting the highest risk of introduction came from interaction with the community. We estimated approximately 1.8% of hospital discharged patients may have been infected.

InterpretationThere is growing evidence in the UK that the risk of transfer of COVID-19 from the high-risk hospital setting to the high-risk care home setting during the early stages of the pandemic was relatively small. Although access to testing was limited to initial symptomatic cases in each care home at this time, our results suggest that reduced numbers of discharges, selection of patients, and action taken within care homes following transfer all may have contributed to mitigation. The precise key transmission routes from the community remain to be quantified.",Joe Hollinghurst; Laura North; Chris Emmerson; Ashley Akbari; Fatemeh Torabi; Ronan A Lyons; Alan G Hawkes; Ed Bennett; Mike B Gravenor; Richard Fry,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253443,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253443,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
117,Learning from the Experiences of COVID-19 Survivors: A Descriptive Study,"BackgroundThere are still many unanswered questions about the novel coronavirus, however, a largely underutilized source of knowledge are the millions of people who have recovered after contracting the virus. This includes majority of undocumented cases of the COVID-19 which are classified as mild or moderate and received little to no clinical care during the course of illness.

ObjectiveTo document and glean insights from the experiences of persons with first-hand experience with coronavirus, especially the so-called mild to moderate cases that self-resolved in isolation.

MethodsThis online-based survey study called C19 Insider Scoop recruited adult participants that are 18-years or older who reside in the United States and tested positive for COVID-19 or antibodies. Participants were recruited through various methods including online support groups for COVID-19 survivors, advertisement in local news outlets, and advertisement through professional and other networks. The main outcomes measured include knowledge on contraction/transmission of the virus, symptoms, and personal experiences on road to recovery.

ResultsA total of 72 participants (53 females/19 males, ages 18 - 73 yrs. old, mean = 41-yrs.) from 22 U.S. states participated in this study. We found that the top known source of how people contracted the COVID-19 virus was through a family or household member (n=26 or 35%). This was followed by essential workers contracting the virus through the workplace (n=13 or 18%).

Participants reported up to 27 less-documented symptoms that they experienced during their illness such as brain/memory fog, palpitations, ear pain/discomfort and neurological problems. In addition, 47 out of 72 participants (65%) reported that their symptoms lasted longer than the commonly cited 2-weeks even for mild cases of COVID-19. In our study, the mean recovery time was 4.5-weeks, and exactly one-half of survivors (50%) still experienced lingering symptoms of COVID-19 after an average of 65-days following illness onset. Additionally, 37 participants (51%) reported that they experienced stigma associated with having COVID-19.

ConclusionThis study presents preliminary findings which suggests that emphasis on family/household spread of COVID-19 may be lacking and there is a general underestimation of the recovery time even for mild cases of the virus. Although a larger study is needed to validate these results, it is important to note that as more people experience COVID-19, insights from prior survivors can enable a more informed public, pave the way for others who may be affected, and guide further research.",Temiloluwa Prioleau,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253728,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253728,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
118,Evidence for antibody as a protective correlate for COVID-19 vaccines,"Though eleven novel COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy, additional affordable, scalable, and deliverable vaccines are needed to meet unprecedented global demand. With placebo-controlled efficacy trials becoming infeasible due to the roll out of licensed vaccines, a correlate of protection is urgently needed to provide a path for regulatory approval of novel vaccines. To assess whether antibody titers may reasonably predict efficacy, we evaluated the relationship between efficacy and in vitro neutralizing and binding antibodies of 7 vaccines for which sufficient data have been generated. Once calibrated to titers of human convalescent sera reported in each study, a robust correlation was seen between neutralizing titer and efficacy ({rho}= 0.79) and binding antibody titer and efficacy ({rho} = 0.93), despite geographically diverse study populations subject to different forces of infection and circulating variants, and use of different endpoints, assays, convalescent sera panels and manufacturing platforms. This correlation is strengthened by substituting post-hoc analyses for efficacy against the ancestral strain (D614G), where available. Together with an accumulating body of evidence from natural history studies and animal models, these results support the use of post-immunization antibody titers as the basis for establishing a correlate of protection for COVID-19 vaccines.",Kristen A Earle; Donna M Ambrosino; Andrew Fiore-Gartland; David Goldblatt; Peter B Gilbert; George R Siber; Peter Dull; Stanley A Plotkin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.20200246,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.20200246,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True

We obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from these patients and examined variants in RBD. As a result, three patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 harboring E484K mutation in January 2021. These three patients were relatives; one was in the 40s, and two were younger than 10 years old. They had no history of staying abroad and were living in Japan. This strains were classified into GR clade (GISAID), 20B clade (Nextstrain) and R.1 lineage (PANGO). As of March 5, 2021, the R.1 lineage have been identified in 305 samples and dominantly observed in the USA (44%, 135 / 305) and Japan (28%, 84 / 305) from the GISAID database. During the period between October 26, 2020 and February 23, 2021, the frequency of the R.1 lineage was 0.97% (84 / 8,629) of the total confirmed data in Japan and 0.15% (135 / 90,450) in the USA. Although SARS-CoV-2 R.1 lineage was not globally predominant as of March 2021, further analysis is needed to determine whether R.1 variant will disappear or expand in the future.",Yosuke Hirotsu; Masao Omata,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253248,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253248,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
120,Epitope-resolved serology test differentiates the clinical outcome of COVID-19 and identifies defects in antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 variants,"BACKGROUNDThe role of humoral immunity in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood owing, in large part, to the complexity of antibodies produced in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome.

METHODSUsing SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays, we screened 146 COVID-19 patients plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution.

RESULTSWe identified 54 linear epitopes from the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein and showed that epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than protein antigens. Specifically, we found that antibody responses to the S(811-825), S(881-895) and N(156-170) epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover, we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes.

CONCLUSIONSEpitope-resolved antibody testing not only offers a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, it may also be used as predictor of clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats.

121,Persistence and detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: immunoassay heterogeneity and implications for serosurveillance,"Serologic studies have been critical in tracking the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reliability of serologic studies for quantifying the proportion of the population that have been infected depends on the extent of antibody decay as well as on assay performance in detecting both recent and older infections. Data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persistence remain sparse, especially from infected individuals with few to no symptoms. In a cohort of mostly mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals tested with three widely-used immunoassays, antibodies persisted for at least 8 months after infection, although detection depended on immunoassay choice, with one of them missing up to 40% of past infections. Simulations reveal that without appropriate adjustment for time-varying assay sensitivity, seroprevalence surveys may underestimate infection rates. As the immune landscape becomes more complex with naturally-infected and vaccinated individuals, assay choice and appropriate assay-performance-adjustment will become even more important for the interpretation of serologic studies.",Javier Perez-Saez; Maria-Eugenia Zaballa; Sabine Yerly; Diego O Andrey; Benjamin Meyer; Isabella Eckerle; Jean Francois Balavoine; Francois Chappuis; Didier Pittet; Didier Trono; Omar Kherad; Nicolas Vuilleumier; Laurent Kaiser; Idris Guessous; Silvia Stringhini; Andrew S Azman; - Specchio-COVID19 Study Group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253710,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253710,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
122,The effect of in-person primary and secondary school instruction on county-level SARS-CoV-2 spread in Indiana,"BackgroundTo determine the county-level effect of in-person primary and secondary school reopening on daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana.

MethodsThis is a county-level population-based study using a panel data regression analysis of the proportion of in-person learning to evaluate an association with community-wide daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases. The study period was July 12-October 6, 2020. We included 73 out of 92 (79.3%) Indiana counties in the analysis, accounting for 85.7% of school corporations and 90.6% of student enrollement statewide. The primary exposure was the proportion of students returning to in-person instruction. The primary outcome was the daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100,000 residents at the county level.

ResultsThere is a statistically significant relationship between the proportion of students attending K-12 schools in-person and the county level daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 28 days later. For all ages, the coefficient of interest ({beta}) is estimated at 3.36 (95% CI: 1.91--4.81; p < 0.001). This coefficient represents the effect of a change the proportion of students attending in-person on new daily cases 28 days later. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in K-12 students attending school in-person is associated with a daily increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the county equal to 0.336 cases/100,000 residents of all ages.

123,"""This is about the coolest thing I've ever seen is that you just showed right up."" COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults: Qualitative data from two samples","BackgroundHomeless-experienced populations are at increased risk of exposure to SARS CoV-2 due to their living environments and face increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease due to underlying health conditions. Little is known about COVID-19 testing and vaccination acceptability among homeless-experienced populations.

ObjectiveTo understand the facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults.

DesignWe conducted in-depth interviews with participants from July-October 2020. We purposively recruited participants from 1) a longitudinal cohort of homeless-experienced older adults in Oakland, CA (n=37) and 2) a convenience sample of people (n=57) during a mobile outreach COVID-19 testing event in San Francisco.

ParticipantsAdults with current or past experience of homelessness.

ApproachWe asked participants about their experiences with and attitudes towards COVID-19 testing and their perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations. We used participant observation techniques to document the interactions between testing teams and those approached for testing. We audio-recorded, transcribed and content analyzed all interviews and identified major themes and subthemes.

Key ResultsParticipants found incentivized COVID-19 testing administered in unsheltered settings and supported by community health outreach workers (CHOWs) to be acceptable. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccine acceptability, citing a desire to return to routine life and civic responsibility. Those who expressed hesitancy cited a desire to see trial data, concerns that vaccines included infectious materials, and mistrust of the government.

ConclusionsParticipants expressed positive evaluations of the incentivized, mobile COVID-19 testing supported by CHOWs in unsheltered settings. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy concerns must be addressed when designing vaccine delivery strategies that overcome access challenges. Based on the successful implementation of COVID-19 testing, we recommend mobile delivery of vaccines using trusted CHOWs to address concerns and facilitate wider access to and uptake of the COVID vaccine.",Kelly R Knight; Michael R Duke; Caitlin A Carey; Graham Pruss; Cheyenne M Garcia; Marguerita Lightfoot; Elizabeth Imbert; Margot B Kushel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253743,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253743,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
124,"The Spike-specific IgA in milk commonly-elicited after SARS-Cov-2 infection is concurrent with a robust secretory antibody response, exhibits neutralization potency strongly correlated with IgA binding, and is highly durable over time","Approximately 10% of infants will experience COVID-19 illness requiring advanced care (1). A potential mechanism to protect this population could be provided by passive immunity through the milk of a previously infected mother. We and others have reported on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk (2-5). We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the milk of 75 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 88% of samples are positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA positive specimens were also positive for Spike-specific antibodies bearing the secretory component. Levels of IgA antibodies and antibodies bearing secretory component were shown to be strongly positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of high-titer in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4-6 weeks and 4-10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant Spike-specific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally, COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC50 range, 2.39 - 89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities were found to be strongly positively correlated. These data are highly relevant to public health, not only in terms of the protective capacity of these antibodies for breastfed infants, but also for the potential use of such antibodies as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given that secretory IgA is highly stable not only in milk and the infant mouth and gut, but in all mucosa including the gastrointestinal tract, upper airway, and lungs (6).",Alisa Fox; Jessica Marino; Fatima Amanat; Kasopefoluwa Y.

Our model was based on secondary infection, hospitalization, restriction, weather, and mobility data per day nested with safety region in the Netherlands.

128,Longitudinal assessment of diagnostic test performance over the course of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection,"What is already known about this topic?Diagnostic tests and sample types for SARS-CoV-2 vary in sensitivity across the infection period.

What is added by this report?We show that both RTqPCR (from nasal swab and saliva) and the Quidel SARS Sofia FIA rapid antigen tests peak in sensitivity during the period in which live virus can be detected in nasal swabs, but that the sensitivity of RTqPCR tests rises more rapidly in the pre-infectious period. We also use empirical data to estimate the sensitivities of RTqPCR and antigen tests as a function of testing frequency.

What are the implications for public health practice?RTqPCR tests will be more effective than rapid antigen tests at identifying infected individuals prior to or early during the infectious period and thus for minimizing forward transmission (provided results reporting is timely). All modalities, including rapid antigen tests, showed >94% sensitivity to detect infection if used at least twice per week.

129,Hospitalization of mild cases of community-acquired pneumonia decreased more than severe ones during the COVID-19 epidemic,"ObjectiveThe epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the entire health care systems. Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the number and severity of cases for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan.

MethodsUsing claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, we included urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from August 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. We compared the monthly ratio of inpatient cases from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. We also compared this ratio according to the severity score ""A-DROP"" and performed an interrupted time series analysis (ITS) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases.

ResultsA total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals were included. During the COVID-19 epidemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020), the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased during the epidemic compared with the same period in the past year (-48.1%), despite only a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones (mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe - 33.2%). The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 epidemic reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP significantly (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI, -521 to -1955).

130,A combined strategy to detect plasma samples reliably with high anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in routine laboratories,"The determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is of interest in many respects. High NAb titers, for example, are the most important criterion regarding the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy. However, common cell culture-based NAb assays are time-consuming and feasible only in special laboratories. Our data reveal the suitability of a novel ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) to easily measure the inhibition-capability of NAbs in the plasma of COVID-19 convalescents. We propose a combined strategy to detect plasma samples with high NAb titers ([&ge;] 1:160) reliably and to, simultaneously, reduce the risk of erroneously identifying low-titer specimens. For this approach, results of the sVNT assay are compared to and combined with those acquired from the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Both assays are appropriate for high-throughput screening in standard BSL-2 laboratories.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the defense against viral infections, for instance plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), have the capacity to produce vast amounts of interferon-alpha (IFN-). In COVID-19 there is a deficit in DC numbers and IFN- production, which has been associated with disease severity. In this work, we described that in addition to the DC deficiency, several DC activation and homing markers were altered in acute COVID-19 patients, which were associated with multiple inflammatory markers. Remarkably, previously hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients remained with decreased numbers of CD1c+ myeloid DCs and pDCs seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the expression of DC markers as CD86 and CD4 were only restored in previously non-hospitalized patients while integrin {beta}7 and indoleamine 2,3- dyoxigenase (IDO) no restoration was observed.

132,Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants by convalescent plasma and hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulins for treatment of COVID-19,"Hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hCoV-2IG) preparations generated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CP) are under evaluation in several clinical trials of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here we explored the antibody epitope repertoire, antibody binding and virus neutralizing capacity of six hCoV-2IG batches as well as nine convalescent plasma (CP) lots against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOC). The Gene-Fragment Phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-heptad repeat regions. Antibody binding to the immunodominant epitopes was higher for hCoV-2IG than CP, with predominant binding to the fusion peptide. In the pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA) and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from around the globe were reduced to different levels by hCoV-2IG lots. The most significant loss of neutralizing activity was seen against the B.1.351 (9-fold) followed by P.1 (3.5-fold), with minimal loss of activity against the B.1.17 and B.1.429 ([&le;]2-fold). Again, the CP showed more pronounced loss of cross-neutralization against the VOCs compared with hCoV-2IG. Significant reduction of hCoV-2IG binding was observed to the RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y and minimal loss of binding to RBD-K417N compared with unmutated RBD. This study suggests that post-exposure treatment with hCoV-2IG is preferable to CP.

133,Combined computational and cellular screening identifies synergistic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by lenvatinib and remdesivir,"Rapid repurposing of existing drugs as new therapeutics for COVID-19 has been an important strategy in the management of disease severity during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we screened by high-throughput docking 6,000 compounds within the DrugBank library for their potential to bind and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease, a chymotrypsin-like enzyme that is essential for viral replication. For 19 candidate hits, parallel in vitro fluorescence-based protease-inhibition assays and Vero-CCL81 cell-based SARS-CoV-2 replication-inhibition assays were performed. One hit, diclazuril (an investigational anti-protozoal compound), was validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro (IC50 value of 29 M) and modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-CCL81 cells. Another hit, lenvatinib (approved for use in humans as an anti-cancer treatment), could not be validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro, but serendipitously exhibited a striking functional synergy with the approved nucleoside analogue remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-CCL81 cells. Lenvatinib is a broadly-acting host receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, but the synergistic effect with remdesivir was not observed with other approved RTK inhibitors (such as pazopanib or sunitinib), suggesting that the mechanism-of-action is independent of host RTKs. Furthermore, time-of-addition studies revealed that lenvatinib/remdesivir synergy probably targets SARS-CoV-2 replication subsequent to host-cell entry. Our study shows that combining computational and cellular screening is an efficient means to identify existing drugs with repurposing potential as antiviral compounds. Future studies should aim at understanding and optimizing the lenvatinib/remdesivir synergistic mechanism as a therapeutic option.

IMPORTANCESuccessful repurposing of existing drugs as COVID-19 therapeutics would be a rapid and important means to limit disease severity during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, we used a computational screening approach to identify existing drugs that might inhibit the function of a critical enzyme (the 3CL main protease) encoded by the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. While we found that diclazuril (an investigational human drug already approved for use in animals) inhibited this viral enzyme in vitro, it only showed modest ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. However, our approach serendipitously identified lenvatinib (an anti-cancer drug approved for use in humans) as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication when combined with the existing approved antiviral drug, remdesivir. Our findings raise the possibility that future studies to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the lenvatinib/remdesivir synergy could uncover new therapeutic principles for treatment of COVID-19 or similar viral diseases.",Marie O.

134,"The inhibitory effects of toothpaste and mouthwash ingredients on the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2, and the protease activity of TMPRSS2, in vitro","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters host cells when the viral spike protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) after binding to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the mucosa of the tongue and gingiva, the oral cavity seems like it is an entry point for SARS-CoV-2. Daily oral care using mouthwash seems to play an important role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the relationship between daily oral care and the mechanisms of virus entry into host cells is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of ingredients that are generally contained in toothpaste and mouthwash on the interaction between the spike protein and ACE2 and on the serine protease activity of TMPRSS2 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in vitro enzyme assay, respectively. Both assays detected inhibitory effects of sodium tetradecene sulfonate, sodium N-lauroyl-N-methyltaurate, sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and copper gluconate. Molecular docking simulations suggested that these ingredients could bind to the inhibitor-binding site of ACE2. In addition, tranexamic acid and 6-aminohexanoic acid, which act as serine protease inhibitors, exerted inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 protease activity. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to further elucidate these mechanisms. Our findings support the possibility that toothpaste and mouthwash contain ingredients that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Riho Tateyama-Makino; Mari Abe-Yutori; Taku Iwamoto; Kota Tsutsumi; Motonori Tsuji; Satoru Morishita; Kei Kurita; Yukio Yamamoto; Eiji Nishinaga; Keiichi Tsukinoki,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.435740,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.435740,2021-03-19,2021-03-19,,False
135,"Common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) efficiently blocks the interaction between ACE2 cell surface receptor and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein D614, mutants D614G, N501Y, K417N and E484K in vitro","On 11th March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, there are rapidly spreading new ""variants of concern"" of SARS-CoV-2, the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the South African (B.1.351) or Brasilian (P.1) variant. All of them contain multiple mutations in the ACE2 receptor recognition site of the spike protein, compared to the original Wuhan sequence, which is of great concern, because of their potential for immune escape. Here we report on the efficacy of common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) to block protein-protein interaction of spike S1 to the human ACE2 cell surface receptor. This could be shown for the original spike D614, but also for its mutant forms (D614G, N501Y, and mix of K417N, E484K, N501Y) in human HEK293-hACE2 kidney and A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 lung cells. High molecular weight compounds in the water-based extract account for this effect. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles was efficiently prevented by the extract and so was virus-triggered pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 secretion. Modern herbal monographs consider the usage of this medicinal plant as safe. Thus, the in vitro results reported here should encourage further research on the clinical relevance and applicability of the extract as prevention strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Significance statementSARS-CoV-2 is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. This might eventually lead the virus into evading existing therapeutic and prophylactic approaches aimed at the viral spike. We found effective inhibition of protein-protein interaction between the human virus cell entry receptor ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike, including five relevant mutations, by water-based common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) extracts. This was shown in vitro using human kidney (HEK293) and lung (A549) cells, overexpressing the ACE2 and ACE2/TMPRSS2 protein, respectively. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus was efficiently prevented by the extract. The results deserve more in-depth analysis of dandelions effectiveness in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and now require confirmatory clinical evidence.",Hoai Thi Thu Tran; Nguyen Phan Khoi Le; Michael Gigl; Corinna Dawid; Evelyn Lamy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.435959,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.435959,2021-03-19,2021-03-19,,False
136,Blunted Fas signaling favors RIPK1-driven neutrophil necroptosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Critically ill COVID-19 patients are characterized by a severely dysregulated cytokine profile and elevated neutrophil counts, which are thought to contribute to disease severity. However, to date it remains unclear how neutrophils contribute to pathophysiology during COVID-19. Here, we assessed the impact of the dysregulated cytokine profile on the tightly regulated cell death program of neutrophils. We show that in a subpopulation of neutrophils, canonical apoptosis was skewed towards rapidly occurring necroptosis. This phenotype was characterized by abrogated caspase-8 activity and increased RIPK1 levels, favoring execution of necroptosis via the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis, as further confirmed in COVID-19 biopsies. Moreover, reduction of sFas-L levels in COVID-19 patients and hence decreased signaling to Fas directly increased RIPK1 levels and correlated with disease severity. Our results suggest an important role for Fas signaling in the regulation of cell death program ambiguity via the ripoptosome in neutrophils during COVID-19 and a potential therapeutic target to curb inflammation and thus influence disease severity and outcome.",Tiziano A Schweizer; Srikanth Mairpady Shambat; Clement Vulin; Sylvia Hoeller; Claudio Acevedo; Markus Huemer; Alejandro Gomez-Mejia; Chun-Chi Chang; Jeruscha Baum; Sanne Hertegonne; Eva Hitz; Daniel A Hofmaenner; Philipp K Buehler; Holger Moch; Reto A Schuepbach; Silvio D Brugger; Annelies S Zinkernagel,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.436166,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.436166,2021-03-19,2021-03-19,,False
137,A single BNT162b2 mRNA dose elicits antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and boost pre-existing humoral and T cell responses,"The standard dosing of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine validated in clinical trials includes two doses administered three weeks apart. While the decision by some public health authorities to space the doses because of limiting supply has raised concerns about vaccine efficacy, data indicate that a single dose is up to 90% effective starting 14 days after its administration. We analyzed humoral and T cells responses three weeks after a single dose of this mRNA vaccine. Despite the proven efficacy of the vaccine at this time point, no neutralizing activity were elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. However, we detected strong anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and Spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular responses dominated by the CD4+ T cell component. A single dose of this mRNA vaccine to individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 boosted all humoral and T cell responses measured, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Neutralizing responses were increased in both potency and breadth, with distinctive capacity to neutralize emerging variant strains. Our results highlight the importance of vaccinating uninfected and previously-infected individuals and shed new light into the potential role of Fc-mediated effector functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy. They also provide support to spacing the doses of two-vaccine regimens to vaccinate a larger pool of the population in the context of vaccine scarcity against SARS-CoV-2.",Alexandra Tauzin; Manon Nayrac; Mehdi Benlarbi; Shang Yu Gong; Romain Gasser; Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres; Nathalie Brassard; Annemarie Laumaea; Dani Vezina; Jeremie Prevost; Sai Priya Anand; Catherine Bourassa; Gabrielle Gendron-Lepage; Halima Medjahed; Guillaume Goyette; Julia Niessl; Olivier Tastet; Laurie Gokool; Chantal Morrisseau; Pascale Arlotto; Leonidas Stamatatos; Andrew T McGuire; Catherine Larochelle; Pradeep Uchil; Maolin Lu; Walther Mothes; Gaston De Serres; Sandrine Moreira; Michel Roger; Jonathan Richard; Valerie Martel-Laferriere; Ralf Duerr; Cecile Tremblay; Daniel E Kaufmann; Andres Finzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.435972,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.435972,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,,False
138,Myocarditis in naturally infected pets with the British variant of COVID-19,"Domestic pets can contract SARS-CoV-2 infection but, based on the limited information available to date, it is unknown whether the new British B.1.1.7 variant can more easily infect certain animal species or increase the possibility of human-to-animal transmission. In this study, we report the first cases of infection of domestic cats and dogs by the British B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed at a specialist veterinary hospital in the South-East of England. Furthermore, we discovered that many owners and handlers of these pets had developed Covid-19 respiratory symptoms 3-6 weeks before their pets became ill and had also tested PCR positive for Covid-19. Interestingly, all these B.1.1.7 infected pets developed atypical clinical manifestations, including severe cardiac abnormalities secondary to myocarditis and a profound impairment of the general health status of the patient but without any primary respiratory signs. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time the ability for companion animals to be infected by the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 and raise questions regarding its pathogenicity in these animals. Moreover, given the enhanced infectivity and transmissibility of B.1.1.7 variant for humans, these findings also highlights more than ever the risk that companion animals may potentially play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 outbreak dynamics than previously appreciated.",Luca Ferasin; Matthieu Fritz; Heidi Ferasin; Pierre Becquart; Vincent Legros; Eric M.

139,Mutational escape from the polyclonal antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely shaped by a single class of antibodies,"Monoclonal antibodies targeting a variety of epitopes have been isolated from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, but the relative contributions of these different antibody classes to the polyclonal response remains unclear. Here we use a yeast-display system to map all mutations to the viral spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by representatives of three potently neutralizing classes of anti-RBD antibodies with high-resolution structures. We compare the antibody-escape maps to similar maps for convalescent polyclonal plasma, including plasma from individuals from whom some of the antibodies were isolated. The plasma-escape maps most closely resemble those of a single class of antibodies that target an epitope on the RBD that includes site E484. Therefore, although the human immune system can produce antibodies that target diverse RBD epitopes, in practice the polyclonal response to infection is dominated by a single class of antibodies targeting an epitope that is already undergoing rapid evolution.",Allison J Greaney; Tyler N Starr; Christopher O Barnes; Yiska Weisblum; Fabian Schmidt; Marina Caskey; Christian Gaebler; Marianna Agudelo; Shlomo Finkin; Zijun Wang; Daniel Poston; Frauke Muecksch; Theodora Hatziioannou; Paul D Bieniasz; Davide F Robbiani; Michel C Nussenzweig; Pamela J Bjorkman; Jesse D Bloom,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435863,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435863,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,,False
140,"A novel SARS-CoV-2 related virus with complex recombination isolated from bats in Yunnan province, China","A novel beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the origin and direct viral ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive. Here, we discovered a new SARS-CoV-2-related virus in Yunnan province, in 2018, provisionally named PrC31, which shares 90.7% and 92.0% nucleotide identities with SARS-CoV-2 and the bat SARSr-CoV ZC45, respectively. Sequence alignment revealed that several genomic regions shared strong identity with SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetic analysis supported that PrC31 shares a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2. The receptor binding domain of PrC31 showed only 64.2% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2. Recombination analysis revealed that PrC31 underwent multiple complex recombination events within the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineages, indicating the evolution of PrC31 from yet-to-be-identified intermediate recombination strains. Combination with previous studies revealed that the beta-CoVs may possess more complicated recombination mechanism.

141,Identification of guanylyltransferase activity in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase,"SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that is responsible for the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which continues to cause significant morbidity, mortality and economic strain. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory disease and death in humans, highlighting the need for effective antiviral therapies. The RNA synthesis machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an ideal drug target and consists of non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), which is directly responsible for RNA synthesis, and numerous co-factors that are involved in RNA proofreading and 5 capping of viral mRNAs. The formation of the 5 cap-1 structure is known to require a guanylyltransferase (GTase) as well as 5 triphosphatase and methyltransferase activities. However, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping remains poorly understood. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase nsp12 functions as a GTase. We characterise this GTase activity and find that the nsp12 NiRAN (nidovirus RdRP-associated nucleotidyltransferase) domain is responsible for carrying out the addition of a GTP nucleotide to the 5 end of viral RNA via a 5 to 5 triphosphate linkage. We also show that remdesivir triphosphate, the active form of the antiviral drug remdesivir, inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 GTase reaction as efficiently as RNA polymerase activity. These data improve understanding of coronavirus mRNA cap synthesis and highlight a new target for novel or repurposed antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory RNA virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses encode an RNA polymerase which, in combination with other viral proteins, is responsible for synthesising capped viral mRNA. mRNA cap synthesis requires a guanylyltransferase enzyme; here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 guanylyltransferase is located in the viral RNA polymerase, and we identify the protein domain responsible for guanylyltransferase activity. Furthermore we demonstrate that remdesivir triphosphate, the active metabolite of remdesivir, inhibits both the guanylyltransferase and RNA polymerase functions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. These findings improve understanding of the coronavirus mRNA cap synthesis mechanism, in addition to highlighting a new target for the development of therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Alexander P Walker; Haitian Fan; Jeremy R Keown; Jonathan Grimes; Ervin Fodor,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435913,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435913,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,,False
142,Genetic variability associated with OAS1 expression in myeloid cells increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and severe COVID-19 outcomes,"Genome-wide association studies of late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD) have highlighted the importance of variants associated with genes expressed by the innate immune system in determining risk for AD. Recently, we and others have shown that genes associated with variants that confer risk for AD are significantly enriched in transcriptional networks expressed by amyloid-responsive microglia. This allowed us to predict new risk genes for AD, including the interferon-responsive oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). However, the function of OAS1 within microglia and its genetic pathway are not known. Using genotyping from 1,313 individuals with sporadic AD and 1,234 control individuals, we confirm that the OAS1 variant, rs1131454, is associated with increased risk for AD and decreased OAS1 expression. Moreover, we note that the same locus was recently associated with critical illness in response to COVID-19, linking variants that are associated with AD and a severe response to COVID-19. By analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of isolated microglia from APPNL-G-F knock-in and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, we identify a transcriptional network that is significantly upregulated with age and amyloid deposition, and contains the mouse orthologue Oas1a, providing evidence that Oas1a plays an age-dependent function in the innate immune system. We identify a similar interferon-related transcriptional network containing OAS1 by analysing scRNA-seq data from human microglia isolated from individuals with AD. Finally, using human iPSC-derived microglial cells (h-iPSC-Mg), we see that OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of microglia. When stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), we note that cells with lower OAS1 expression show an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, with increased expression and secretion of TNF-. Collectively, our data support a link between genetic risk for AD and susceptibility to critical illness with COVID-19 centred on OAS1 and interferon signalling, a finding with potential implications for future treatments of both AD and COVID-19, and the development of biomarkers to track disease progression.",Naciye Magusali; Andrew C Graham; Thomas M Piers; Pantila Panichnantakul; Umran Yaman; Maryam Shoai; Regina H Reynolds; Juan A.

143,Evaluation of a new spike (S) protein based commercial immunoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG,"BackgroundThe investigation of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 represents a key aspect in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we compared one new and four widely used commercial serological assays for the detection of antibodies targeting S (spike) and NC (nucleocapsid) protein.

MethodsSerum samples from a group of apparently non-responders, from an unbiased group of convalescent patients and from a negative control group were sim-ultaneously analyzed by the LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG ELISA and IDK(R) anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assays. IgG binding NC were detected by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and by the panimmunoglobulin immunoassay Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, samples were also tested by live virus and pseudovirus neutralization tests.

ResultsOverall, about 50% of convalescent patients with undetectable IgG antibodies using the commercial kit by Euroimmun were identified as IgG positive by Immundiagnostik and Roche. While both assays achieved similarly high sensitivities, Immundiagnostik correlated better with serum neutralizing activity than Roche.

144,The B1.351 and P.1 variants extend SARS-CoV-2 host range to mice,"Receptor recognition is a major determinant of viral host range, as well as infectivity and pathogenesis. Emergences have been associated with serendipitous events of adaptation upon encounters with a novel host, and the high mutation rate of RNA viruses has been proposed to explain their frequent host shifts 1. SARS-CoV-2 extensive circulation in humans has been associated with the emergence of variants, including variants of concern (VOCs) with diverse mutations in the spike and increased transmissibility or immune escape 2. Here we show that unlike the initial virus, VOCs are able to infect common laboratory mice, replicating to high titers in the lungs. This host range expansion is explained in part by the acquisition of changes at key positions of the receptor binding domain that enable binding to the mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor, although differences between viral lineages suggest that other factors are involved in the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs to infect mice.

With tough decisions for allocating resources(i.e. vaccines)[1] are being made, forecasting through machine learning has become more important than ever. Moreover, as vaccines are being brought to the public and cases are going down, it is time that we reflect on where the pandemic has taken the most toll:for the purpose of future reform. This research illustrates two different models and algorithms for COVID-19 forecasting: Auto Regressive models and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs). The results show the true potential of RNNs to work with sequential and time-series data to forecast future cases and deaths in different states. As the paper utilizes the tanh activation function and multiple LSTM layers, the research will show the importance of machine learning and its ability to help politicians make decisions when it comes to helping states during the pandemic and future reform. The data will also pre-process the time-series data, using rolling statistics and will clean the data for the auto-regressive model and RNN layers.

148,A proteome-wide genetic investigation identifies several SARS-CoV-2-exploited host targets of clinical relevance,"The virus SARS-CoV-2 can exploit biological vulnerabilities in susceptible hosts that predispose to development of severe COVID-19. Previous reports have identified several host proteins related to the interferon response (e.g. OAS1), interleukin-6 signalling (IL-6R), and the coagulation cascade (linked via ABO) that were associated with risk of COVID-19. In the present study, we performed proteome-wide genetic colocalisation tests leveraging publicly available protein and COVID-19 datasets, to identify additional proteins that may contribute to COVID-19 risk. Our analytic approach identified several known targets (e.g. ABO, OAS1), but also nominated new proteins such as soluble FAS (colocalisation probability > 0.9, p = 1 x 10-4), implicating FAS-mediated apoptosis as a potential target for COVID-19 risk. We also undertook polygenic (pan) and cis-Mendelian randomisation analyses that showed consistent associations of genetically predicted ABO protein with several COVID-19 phenotypes. The ABO signal was associated with plasma concentrations of several proteins, with the strongest association observed with CD209 in several proteomic datasets. We demonstrated experimentally that CD209 directly interacts with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a mechanism that could explain the ABO association with COVID-19. Our work provides a prioritised list of host targets potentially exploited by SARS-CoV-2 and is a precursor for further research on CD209 and FAS as therapeutically tractable targets for COVID-19.",Mohd Anisul Karim; Jarrod Shilts; Jeremy Schwartzentruber; James Hayhurst; Annalisa Buniello; Elmutaz Shaikho Elhaj Mohammed; Jie Zheng; Michael V.

149,Lessons learned from the resilience of Chinese hospitals to the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review.,"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought huge strain on hospitals worldwide, the resilience shown by Chinas hospitals appears to have been a critical factor in their successful response to the pandemic. This paper aims to determine the key findings, recommendations and lessons learned in terms of hospital resilience during the pandemic, as well as the quality and limitations of research in this field at present.

We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the resilience of hospitals in China during the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of 2020. Two online databases (the CNKI and WHO databases) were used to identify papers meeting the eligibility criteria, from which we selected 59 publications (English: n= 26; Chinese: n= 33). After extracting the data, we present an information synthesis using a resilience framework.

We found that much research was rapidly produced in the first half of 2020, describing certain strategies used to improve hospital resilience, particularly in three key areas: human resources; management and communication; and security, hygiene and planning. Our search revealed that considerable attention was focused on interventions related to training, healthcare worker well-being, e-health/ telemedicine, and work organization, while other areas, such as hospital financing, information systems and healthcare infrastructure, were less well represented in the literature.

We identified a number of lessons learned regarding how Chinas hospitals have maintained resilience when confronted with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, we also noted that the literature was dominated by descriptive case studies, often lacking consideration of methodological limitations, and that there was a lack of both highly-focused research on individual interventions and holistic research that attempted to unite the topics within a resilience framework.

ExposuresA single intravenous infusion of either bamlanivimab 700 mg or casirivimab/imdevimab 1200 mg/1200 mg.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was emergency department visit or hospitalization within 14 days of positive test. Patients who received MAb infusion were compared to contemporaneous controls using inverse probability of treatment weighting, and to a pre-implementation cohort using propensity-weighted interrupted time series analysis. An exploratory analysis compared effectiveness of casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab.

Results7404 patients who would have been MAb-eligible were identified in a pre-implementation cohort (July 1-November 27, 2020). In the post-implementation period (November 28, 2020-January 28, 2021), 594 received MAb treatment and 5536 MAb-eligible patients did not. Among Mab recipients, 479 (80.6%) received bamlanivimab and 115 (19.4%) casirivimab/imdevimab. The primary outcome occurred in 75 (12.6%) MAb recipients, 1018 (18.4%) contemporaneous controls, and 1525 (20.6%) patients in the pre-implementation cohort. MAb treatment was associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations (odds ratio estimating the average treatment effect 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79). After implementation, propensity-weighted probability of emergency department visit or hospitalization decreased by 0.7% per day (95% CI 0.03-0.10%, p<0.001). Overall, 7 (1.2%) MAb patients experienced an adverse event; two (0.3%) were considered serious. In the exploratory analysis, the effect of casirivimab/imdevimab versus bamlanivimab was not significant (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.17-1.63, p=0.26).

Conclusions and RelevanceMAb treatment of high-risk ambulatory patients with early COVID-19 was well-tolerated and effective at preventing the need for subsequent medically-attended care.

151,"Hospitalisation rates differed by city district and ethnicity during the first wave of COVID-19 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands","BackgroundIt is important to gain insight into the burden of COVID-19 at city district level to develop targeted prevention strategies. We examined COVID-19 related hospitalisations by city district and migration background in the municipality of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

MethodsWe used surveillance data on all PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisations in Amsterdam until 31 May 2020, matched to municipal registration data on migration background. We calculated directly standardised (age, sex) rates (DSR) of hospitalisations, as a proxy of COVID-19 burden, per 100,000 population by city district and migration background. We calculated standardised rate differences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) to compare hospitalisations between city districts of varying socio-economic and health status and between migration backgrounds. We evaluated the effects of city district and migration background on hospitalisation after adjusting for age and sex using Poisson regression.

ResultsBetween 29 February and 31 May 2020, 2326 cases (median age 57 years [IQR=37-74]) were notified in Amsterdam, of which 596 (25.6%) hospitalisations and 287 (12.3%) deaths. 526/596 (88.2%) hospitalisations could be matched to the registration database. DSR were higher in individuals living in peripheral (South-East/New-West/North) city districts with lower economic and health status, compared to central districts (Centre/West/South/East) (RD=36.87,95%CI=25.79-47.96;RR=1.82,95%CI=1.65-1.99), and among individuals with a non-Western migration background compared to ethnic-Dutch individuals (RD=57.05,95%CI=43.34-70.75; RR=2.36,95%CI=2.17-2.54). City district and migration background were independently associated with hospitalisation.

ConclusionCity districts with lower economic and health status and those with a non-Western migration background had the highest burden of COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19 in Amsterdam.",Liza Coyer; Elke Wynberg; Marcel Buster; Camiel Wijffels; Maria Prins; Anja Schreijer; Yvonne T.

152,Faecal shedding models for SARS-CoV-2 RNA amongst hospitalised patients and implications for wastewater-based epidemiology,"The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces is not well established, posing challenges for wastewater-based surveillance of COVID-19 and risk assessments of environmental transmission. We develop versatile hierarchical models for faecal RNA shedding and apply them to data collected in six studies. We find that the mean number of gene copies per mL of faeces is 1.9x106 (2.3x105--2.0x108 95% credible interval) amongst hospitalised patients. We find no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed RNA: limits of quantification can account for negative stool samples. Our models indicate that hospitalised patients represent the tail of the shedding profile with a half-life of 34 hours (28--43 95% credible interval), suggesting that wastewater-based surveillance signals are more indicative of incidence than prevalence and can be a leading indicator of clinical presentation. Shedding amongst inpatients cannot explain high RNA concentrations observed in wastewater, consistent with more abundant shedding during the early infection course.",Till Hoffmann; Justin Alsing,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253603,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253603,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
153,A bibliometric analysis of COVID-19 research in Africa,"BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented global research effort to build a body of knowledge that can inform mitigation strategies. We carried out a bibliometric analysis to describe the COVID-19 research output in Africa.

MethodsWe searched for articles published between 1st December 2019 and 3rd January 2021 from various databases including PubMed, African Journals Online, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, Collabovid, the World Health Organisation global research database and Google for grey literature. Editorial type publications and papers reporting original research done in Africa and were included. Data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel.

ResultsA total of 1296 articles were retrieved. 46.6% were primary research articles, 48.6% were editorials type articles while 4.6% were secondary research articles. 20.3% articles used the entire continent of Africa as their study setting while South Africa (15.4%) was the most common country focused setting. 90.3% of the articles had at least one African researcher as author, 78.5% had an African researcher as first author, while 63.5% had an African researcher as last author. The University of Cape Town tops the list with the greatest number of first and last authors. Over 13% of the articles were published in MedRxiv and of the studies that declared funding, the Wellcome Trust was the top funding body. The most common research topics include ""country preparedness and response"" (24.9%) and ""the direct and indirect health impacts of the pandemic"" (21.6%). However, only 1.0% of articles focus on therapeutics and vaccines.

ConclusionsThis study sheds light on the contribution of African researchers to COVID-19 research in Africa and highlights Africas existing capacity to carry out research that addresses local problems.

154,Epidemiological and clinical insights from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle amplification values,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an unprecedented daily use of molecular RT-PCR tests. These tests are interpreted qualitatively for diagnosis, and the relevance of the test result intensity, i.e. the number of amplification cycles (Ct), is debated because of strong potential biases. We analyze a national database of tests performed on more than 2 million individuals between January and November 2020. Although we find Ct values to vary depending on the testing laboratory or the assay used, we detect strong significant trends with patient age, number of days after symptoms onset, or the state of the epidemic (the temporal reproduction number) at the time of the test.

155,PD-1highCXCR5-CD4+ Peripheral Helper T (Tph) cells Promote Tissue-Homing Plasmablasts in COVID-19,"A dysregulated immune response against coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a critical role in the outcome of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A significant increase in circulating plasmablasts is characteristic of COVID-19 though the underlying mechanisms and its prognostic implications are not known. Here, we demonstrate that in the acute phase of COVID-19, activated PD-1highCXCR5-CD4+ T cells, peripheral helper T cells, (Tph) are significantly increased and promote inflammatory tissue-homing plasmablasts in patients with stable but not severe COVID-19. Analysis of scRNA-seq data revealed that plasmablasts in stable patients express higher levels of tissue-homing receptors including CXCR3. The increased Tph cells exhibited ""B cell help"" signatures similar to that of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and promoted B cell differentiation in vitro. Compared with cTfh cells, Tph cells produced more IFN{gamma}, inducing tissue-homing chemokine receptors on plasmablasts. Finally, expansion of activated Tph cells was correlated with the frequency of CXCR3+ plasmablasts in the acute phase of patients with stable disease. Our results demonstrate a novel role for Tph cells in acute viral immunity by inducing ectopic, antibody secreting plasmablasts.",Hiromitsu Asashima; Subhasis Mohanty; Michela Comi; William E Ruff; Kenneth B Hoehn; Patrick Wong; Inessa Cohen; Sarah Coffey; Khadir Raddassi; Omkar Chaudhary; Avraham Unterman; Brinda Emu; Steven H Kleinstein; Ruth R Montgomery; Akiko Iwasaki; Charles S Dela Cruz; Naftali Kaminski; Albert C Shaw; David A Hafler; Tomokazu S Sumida,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253527,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253527,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
156,COVID-19 with early neurological and cardiac thromboembolic phenomena--timeline of incidence and clinical features,"BackgroundAt our tertiary care public hospital, we saw COVID-19 presenting with thromboembolic phenomena, indicating a possible early thrombo-inflammatory pathology.

ObjectivesWe documented patients with cardiac and neurological thromboembolic phenomena as a primary presentation of COVID-19, and compared a subset of COVID associated strokes against COVID-19 patients without thrombotic manifestations.

MethodsWe included all COVID-Stroke and COVID-ACS (COVID-19, with ischemic arterial stroke/Acute Coronary Syndrome presenting prior to/simultaneous with/within 72 hours of systemic/respiratory COVID manifestations) admitted from April to November 2020. In the nested case control analysis, we used unpaired T-test and chi-square test to study differences between COVID-Strokes (case group) and non-thrombotic COVID controls.

Results and ConclusionsWe noted 68 strokes and 122 ACS associated with COVID-19. ACS peaked in May-June, while stroke admissions peaked later in September-October, possibly because severe strokes may have expired at home during the lockdown.

In the case-control analysis, cases (n=43; 12F:31M; mean age 51.5 years) had significantly higher D-Dimer values than controls (n=50; 9F:41M; mean age 51.6 years). Mortality was significantly higher in cases (51.2% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.018). We noted 7.5 times higher mortality in cases versus controls even among patients needing minimal oxygen support. Imaging in 37 patients showed both anterior and posterior circulation territories affected in seven, with almost half of Carotid territory strokes being large hemispherical strokes. Additionally, CT/MRI angiography in 28 strokes showed large vessel occlusions in 19 patients. Death in cases thus probably occurred before progression to intense respiratory support, due to severe central nervous system insult.

Binary logistic regression analysis showed respiratory support intensity to be the sole independent predictor of mortality among cases. Respiratory distress could have been due to COVID-19 lung infection or aspiration pneumonia resulting from obtunded sensorium. In controls, mortality was predicted by increasing age, female sex, and respiratory support intensity.",Uma Sundar; Sanah Merchant; Meera Shah; Amita Mukhopadhyay; Shaonak Kolte; Pramod Darole; Sharvari Mahajan; Ashank Bansal; Satish Gosavi; Dnaneshwar Asole; Niteen Karnik; Ajay Mahajan; Anagha Joshi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253619,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253619,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
157,The course of the UK COVID 19 pandemic; no measurable impact of new variants.,"IntroductionIn November 2020, a new SARS-COV-2 variant or the  Kent variant emerged in the UK, and became the dominant UK SARS-COV-2 variant, demonstrating faster transmission than the original variant, which rapidly died out. However, it is unknown if this altered the overall course of the pandemic as genomic analysis was not common place at the outset and other factors such as the climate could alter the viral transmission rate over time. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the overall observed viral transmission was not altered by the emergence of the new variant, by testing a model generated earlier in the pandemic based on lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity.

MethodsFrom 1/1/20 to 4/2/21, the daily incidence of SARS-COV-2 deaths and the overall stringency of National Lockdown policy on each day was extracted from the Oxford University Government response tracker. The daily average temperature and humidity for London was extracted from Wunderground.com.

The viral reproductive rate was calculated on a daily basis from the daily mortality data for each day. The correlation between log10 of viral reproductive rate and lockdown stringency and weather parameters were compared by Pearson correlation to determine the time lag associated with the greatest correlation.

A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed using lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity for the period 1/1/20 to 30/9/20. This model was extrapolated forward from 1/10/20 to 4/2/21 and the predicted viral reproductive rate, daily mortality and cumulative mortality were compared with official data.

ResultsOn multivariate linear regression, the optimal model had and R2 0f 0.833 for prediction of log10 viral reproductive rate 13 days later in the model construction period, with (coefficient, probability) lockdown stringency (-0.0109, p=0.0000), humidity (0.0038, p=0.0041) and temperature (-0.0035, p=0.0008). When extrapolated to the validation period (1/10/20 to 4/2/21), the model was highly correlated with daily (Pearson coefficient 0.88, p=0.0000) and cumulated SARS-COV-2 mortality (Pearson coefficient 0.99, p=0.0000).

160,Characterizing altruistic motivation in potential volunteers for SARS-CoV-2 challenge trials,"In human challenge trials, volunteers are deliberately infected with a pathogen to accelerate vaccine development and answer key scientific questions. In the U.S., preparations for challenge trials with the novel coronavirus are complete, and in the U.K., challenge trials have recently begun. However, ethical concerns have been raised about the potential for invalid consent or exploitation. These concerns largely reflect worries that challenge trial volunteers may be unusually risk-seeking or too economically vulnerable to refuse the payments these trials provide, rather than being motivated primarily by altruistic goals. We conducted the first large-scale survey of intended human challenge trial volunteers and found that SARS-CoV-2 challenge trial volunteers exhibit high levels of altruistic motivations without any special indication of poor risk perception or economic vulnerability. Findings indicate that challenge trials with the novel coronavirus can attract volunteers with background conditions, attitudes, and motivations that should allay key ethical concerns.",Sophie M.

We investigated associations between lockdown stringency and objective sleep and resting-heart rate measures in 113,000 users of a consumer sleep tracker across 20 countries from Jan-Jul 2020. With stricter lockdown measures, midsleep times were universally delayed, particularly on weekdays, while midsleep variability and resting heart rate declined. These shifts (midsleep: +0.09 to +0.58 hours; midsleep variability: -0.12 to -0.26 hours; resting heart rate: -0.35 to -2.08 bpm) correlated with the severity of lockdown across different countries and highlight the graded influence of mobility restriction and social isolation on human physiology.",Ju Lynn Ong; TeYang Lau; Mari Karsikas; Hannu Kinnunen; Michael W.L.

162,"COVID-19 and Cognitive Impairment: Severity, Evolution, and Functional Impact during Inpatient Rehabilitation","ObjectiveTo determine the frequency, magnitude, and change in cognitive impairment in patients with COVID-19 undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. We secondarily evaluated correlates of cognitive impairment and the relationship between cognition and functional gain.

DesignCross-sectional observational study with assessments at admission and discharge

SettingAcute inpatient rehabilitation unit within a large, urban academic medical center

Participants77 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and subsequently admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit between March-August 2020, 45 of whom were re-assessed at discharge.

InterventionsN/A

Main Outcome MeasuresMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores on admission and discharge (when available) and Quality Indicator for Self-Care (QI-SC) scores on admission and discharge.

Results62/77 (80.5%) of patients demonstrated cognitive deficits on the MoCA at admission: 39/77 (50.6%) were mildly impaired, 20/77 (26%) moderately impaired, and 3/77 (3.9%) severely impaired. Cognitive impairment was associated with a prior history of delirium, but not age or length of acute care hospitalization. 32/45 (71.1%) patients with discharge scores improved and met the MoCA minimally clinically important difference (MCID); however, 35/45 (77.8%) continued to score in the impaired range. Patients who met the MoCA MCID demonstrated significantly greater QI-SC score gains than those that did not meet the MCID (p=.02).

ConclusionCognitive impairment is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring acute inpatient rehabilitation. Cognitive impairment improves over the course of inpatient rehabilitation, and is associated with functional gain.

163,Post-viral parenchymal lung disease of COVID-19 and viral pneumonitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundApproximately half of patients discharged following COVID-19 related hospitalisation are reported to suffer from persisting respiratory symptoms. We assess the prevalence of long term radiological and functional pulmonary sequelae in survivors from COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in published literature.

MethodsWe performed systematic review and meta-analysis of all original studies in adults admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or Influenza pneumonia and followed within 12 months from discharge. Searches were run on MEDLINE and Embase, with the last update on 1st March 2021. Primary outcomes were presence of 1) radiologic sequelae at CT scans; 2) restrictive impairment; 3) reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). This review is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42020183139.

ResultsSixty studies were included for qualitative synthesis, of which 41 were suitable for meta-analysis. On follow up CT scans, the overall estimated proportion was 0{middle dot}56 (95%CI 0{middle dot}44 to 0{middle dot}66, I2= 94{middle dot}44%) for inflammatory changes, and 0{middle dot}40 (95%CI 0{middle dot}29 to 0{middle dot}52, I2=95{middle dot}19%) for fibrotic findings. In SARS-CoV-2 specifically, proportions were estimated at 0{middle dot}43 (95%CI 0{middle dot}32 to 0{middle dot}56, I2=94.60%) and 0{middle dot}30 (95%CI 0{middle dot}19 to 0{middle dot}43, I2=94.89%) for inflammatory and fibrotic findings, respectively. Overall proportion for restrictive impairment was 0{middle dot}19 (95%CI 0{middle dot}12 to 0{middle dot}27, I2=94{middle dot}46%), DLCO reduction was estimated at 0{middle dot}45 (95%CI 0{middle dot}38 to 0{middle dot}52, I2=90{middle dot}10). Elevated radiological and functional estimates persisted across follow-up times. Confidence in the estimates was deemed very low as studies were largely observational without control groups, heterogeneity in estimates was high but was not clearly attributable to between-study differences of severity or design.

ConclusionAlthough estimates of prevalence are likely limited by differences in case mix and initial severity, a substantial proportion of radiological and functional sequelae are observed following viral pneumonitis, including COVID-19. This highlights the importance of vigilant radiological and functional follow up.

164,Understanding Convergence Between Non-Hispanic Black and White COVID-19 Mortality: A County-Level Approach,"BackgroundNon-Hispanic Black populations have suffered greater per capita COVID-19 mortality at more than 1.5 times that of White populations. Previous work has established that, over time, rates of Black and White mortality have converged; however, some studies suggest that regional shifts in COVID-19 prevalence may play a role in the relative change between racial groups. This studys objective was to investigate changes in Black and White COVID-19 mortality over time and uncover potential mechanisms driving these changes.

Methods and FindingsUsing county-level COVID-19 mortality data stratified by race, we investigate the trajectory of non-Hispanic Black mortality, White mortality, and the Black/White per capita mortality ratio from June 2020-January 2021. Over this period, in the counties studied, cumulative mortality rose by 56.7% and 82.8% for Black and White populations respectively, resulting in a decrease in mortality ratio of 0.369 (23.8%). These trends persisted even when a county-level fixed-effects model was used to estimate changes over time within counties (controlling for all time-invariant county level characteristics and removing the effects of changes in regional distribution of COVID-19). Next, we leverage county-level variation over time in COVID-19 prevalence to show that the decline in the Black/White mortality ratio can be explained by changes in COVID-19 prevalence. Finally, we study heterogeneity in the time trend, finding that convergence occurs most significantly in younger populations, areas with less dense populations, and outside of the Northeast. Limitations include suppressed data in counties with fewer than 10 deaths in a racial category, and the use of provisional COVID-19 death data that may be incomplete.

ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that convergence in Black/White mortality is not driven by county-level characteristics or changes in the regional dispersion of COVID-19, but instead by changes within counties. Further, declines in the Black/White mortality ratio appear strongly linked to changes in COVID-19 prevalence, rather than a time-specific effect. Further studies on changes in exposure by race over time, or on the vulnerability of individuals who died at different points in the pandemic, may provide crucial insight on mechanisms and strategies to further reduce COVID-19 mortality disparities.",Ralph Ignacio Lawton; Kevin Z Zheng; Daniel Zheng; Erich S Huang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253566,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253566,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
165,Tocilizumab Effect in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Control Trials,"Since the emergence of the first cases of COVID-19 viral pneumonia late 2019 several studies evaluated the benefits of different treatment modalities. Early in the pandemic, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antibody Tocilizumab was considered in view of the cytokine release syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection. Several early observational studies showed beneficial effect of treatment with Tocilizumab on mortality, however, results from well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCT) were contradicting.

ObjectivesTo perform a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of RCTs utilizing Tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, with in-hospital mortality as a primary objective, while secondary objectives included composite outcome of mortality, intubation, or ICU admission, another secondary outcome was super added infection.

MethodThis was a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) model of relative risk (RR), along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, p values, and forest plots of both primary and secondary outcomes. A fixed effect sensitivity test was performed for the primary outcome, in addition to subgroup and meta-regression analyses with predefined criteria.

ResultsThe primary outcome of mortality showed statistically insignificant reduction of mortality with Tocilizumab (RR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8 - 1.01; p = 0.09) although with an unmistakable apparent clinical benefit. There was a significant reduction in the RR of the secondary composite outcome (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.9; p < 0.001), and no difference between groups in super-added infection (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.51 - 1.19; p = 0.24). Treatment protocol allowing a second dose was the only significant predictor of improved mortality in the meta-regression analysis. Certainty of evidence was reduced to moderate for the primary outcome and the secondary outcome of clinical deterioration, while it was reduced to low for the secondary outcome of super-added infection.

ConclusionModerate certainty of evidence suggest no statistically significant improvement of 28-30 day all-cause mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with TCZ, although there may be clinically important value. Moderate certainty of evidence suggest lowered relative risk of a composite outcome of death or clinical deterioration, while, low grade evidence indicate no increase in the risk of super-added infection associated with TCZ treatment. A protocol allowing two doses of TCZ shows evidence of improved mortality as compared to a strictly single dose protocol.",Waleed Tharwat Aletreby; Basheer Abdulrahman; Ahmed Fouad Mady; Alfateh Mohammed Noor; Mohammed H Lhmdi; Fahad Faqihi; Abdulrahman M Alharthy; Mohammed A Al-Odat; Dimitrios Karakitsos; Ziad Memish,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253581,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253581,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True

167,Associations of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness with patient age and comorbidities,"Vaccinations are considered the major tool to curb the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine has demonstrated a 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 disease. These results are now corroborated with statistical analyses of real-world vaccination rollouts, but resolving vaccine effectiveness across demographic groups is challenging. Here, applying a multivariable logistic regression analysis approach to a large patient-level dataset, including SARS-CoV-2 tests, vaccine inoculations and personalized demographics, we model vaccine effectiveness at daily resolution and its interaction with sex, age and comorbidities. Vaccine effectiveness gradually increased post day 12 of inoculation, then plateaued, around 35 days, reaching 91.2% [CI 88.8%-93.1%] for all infections and 99.3% [CI 95.3%-99.9%] for symptomatic infections. Effectiveness was uniform for men and women yet declined mildly but significantly with age and for patients with specific chronic comorbidities, most notably type 2 diabetes.

168,Quantitative Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test and Antigen Testing Algorithms: A Decision Analysis Simulation Model,"BackgroundAntigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 offer advantages over nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs, such as RT-PCR), including lower cost and rapid return of results, but show reduced sensitivity. Public health organizations continue to recommend different strategies for utilizing NAATs and antigen tests in various settings. There has not yet been a quantitative comparison of the expected performance of these strategies.

MethodsWe utilized a decision analysis approach to simulate the expected outcomes of six algorithms for implementing NAAT and antigen testing, analogous to testing strategies recommended by public health organizations. Each algorithm was simulated 50,000 times for four SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence levels ranging from 5% to 20% in a population of 100000 persons seeking testing. Primary outcomes were number of missed cases, number of false-positive diagnoses, and total test volumes. Outcome medians and 95% uncertainty ranges (URs) were reported.

ResultsAlgorithms that use NAATs to confirm all negative antigen results minimized missed cases but required high NAAT capacity: 92,200 (95% UR: 91,200-93,200) tests (in addition to 100,000 antigen tests) at 10% prevalence. Substituting repeat antigen testing in lieu of NAAT confirmation of all initial negative antigen tests resulted in 2,280 missed cases (95% UR: 1,507-3,067) at 10% prevalence. Selective use of NAATs to confirm antigen results when discordant with symptom status (e.g., symptomatic persons with negative antigen results) resulted in the most efficient use of NAATs, with 25 NAATs (95% UR: 13-57) needed to detect one additional case at 10% prevalence compared to exclusive use of antigen tests.

ConclusionsNo single SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithm is likely to be optimal across settings with different levels of prevalence and for all programmatic priorities; each presents a trade-off between prioritized outcomes and resource constraints. This analysis provides a framework for selecting setting-specific strategies to achieve acceptable balances and trade-offs between programmatic priorities and constraints.

169,Seroreactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in individuals attending a university campus in Bogota Colombia,"Most community-specific serological surveys for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been done in healthcare workers and institutions. In this study, IgG antibodies specific for the virus were evaluated in individuals working at one university in Bogota-Colombia. The aim of this work was to determine previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in those attending the campus during city lockdown. A total of 237 individuals including 93 women and 144 men were evaluated using chemiluminescent detection of IgG anti N-viral protein. There were 32 positives giving a seroprevalence of 13.5% (10 women and 22 men) and mostly asymptomatic (68.75%). Only 13 of the seropositive individuals had previous positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR done in average 91 days before serological test. Seropositive individuals did not come from localities having higher percentages of SARS-CoV-2 cases in the city. Three cluster of seropositive individuals were identified. This survey was carried out after the first peak of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the city, and before the preparedness to reopening the campus for students in 2021.

170,"Patterns of compliance with COVID-19 preventive behaviours: a latent class analysis of 20,000 UK adults","BackgroundGovernments have implemented a range of measure to tackle COVID-19, primarily focusing on changing citizens behaviours in order to lower transmission of the virus. Few studies have looked at the patterns of compliance with different measures within individuals: whether people comply with all measures or selectively choose some but not others. Such research is important for designing interventions to increase compliance.

MethodsWe used cross-sectional data from 20,947 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected 17 November - 23 December 2020. Self-report compliance was assessed with six behaviours: mask wearing, hand washing, indoor household mixing, outdoor household mixing, social distancing, and compliance with other guidelines. Patterns of compliance behaviour were identified using latent class analysis, and multinomial logistic regression was used to assess demographic, socioeconomic and personality predictors of behaviour patterns.

ResultsWe selected a four latent class solution. Most individuals reported similar levels of compliance across the six behaviour measures. High levels of compliance was the modal response. Lower self-reported compliance was related to young age, high risk-taking behaviour, low confidence in government, and low empathy, among other factors. Looking at individual behaviours, mask wearing had the highest level of compliance whilst compliance with social distancing was relatively low.

ConclusionResults suggest that individuals choose to comply with all guidelines, rather than some but not others. Strategies to increase compliance should focus on increasing general motivations to comply alongside specifically encouraging social distancing.",Liam Wright; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253717,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253717,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
171,SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology on a Public University Campus in Washington State,"BackgroundTesting programs have been utilized as part of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies on university campuses, and it is not known which strategies successfully identify cases and contain outbreaks.

ObjectiveEvaluation of a testing program to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a large university.

DesignProspective longitudinal study using remote contactless enrollment, daily mobile symptom and exposure tracking, and self-swab sample collection. Individuals were tested if the participant was (1) exposed to a known case, developed new symptoms, or reported high-risk behavior, (2) a member of a group experiencing an outbreak, or (3) at baseline upon enrollment.

SettingAn urban, public university during Autumn quarter of 2020

ParticipantsStudents, staff, and faculty.

MeasurementsSARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was conducted, and viral genome sequencing was performed.

ResultsWe enrolled 16,476 individuals, performed 29,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests, and detected 236 infections. Greek community affiliation was the strongest risk factor for testing positive. 75.0% of positive cases reported at least one of the following: symptoms (60.8%), exposure (34.7%), or high-risk behaviors (21.5%). 88.1% of viral genomes (52/59) sequenced from Greek-affiliated students were genetically identical to at least one other genome detected, indicative of rapid SARS-CoV-2 spread within this group, compared to 37.9% (11/29) of genomes from non-Greek students and employees.

LimitationsObservational study.

ConclusionIn a setting of limited resources during a pandemic, we prioritized testing of individuals with symptoms and high-risk exposure during outbreaks. Rapid spread of SARS- CoV-2 occurred within outbreaks without evidence of further spread to the surrounding community.

172,Vaccine escape in a heterogeneous population: insights for SARS-CoV-2 from a simple model,"As a counter measure to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there has been swift development and clinical trial assessment of candidate vaccines, with subsequent deployment as part of mass vaccination campaigns. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated the ability to mutate and develop variants, which can modify epidemiological properties and the potentially also the effectiveness of vaccines.

The widespread deployment of highly effective vaccines may rapidly exert selection pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus directed towards mutations that escape the vaccine induced immune response. This is particularly concerning whilst infection is widespread. By developing and analysing a mathematical model of two population groupings with differing vulnerability and contact rates, we explore the impact of the deployment of vaccine amongst the population on R, cases, disease abundance and vaccine escape pressure.

The results from this model illustrate two insights (i) vaccination aimed at reducing prevalence could be more effective at reducing disease than directly vaccinating the vulnerable; (ii) the highest risk for vaccine escape can occur at intermediate levels of vaccination. This work demonstrates a key principle that the careful targeting of vaccines towards particular population groups could reduce disease as much as possible whilst limiting the risk of vaccine escape.",Julia Rose Gog; Edward M Hill; Leon Danon; Robin N Thompson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253544,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253544,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
173,Impact of booster COVID-19 vaccine for Moroccan adults: A discrete age-structured model approach,"Public health control strategies, such as lockdown, seem to be effective in reducing the spread of the pandemic, but are ineffective as a whole since lockdown is responsible of global economic crisis and badly lived by the majority of children and adults who have developed mental health disorders and familial problems as well. Thus, the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is needed to control this disease. We have developed a discrete age-structured model and followed the Moroccan vaccination program to assess the impact of booster vaccination targeting Moroccan adults against COVID-19. Using the derived model, we estimated some relevant model parameters related to COVID-19 using collected cumulative mortality and reported Moroccan data. A control reproduction number Rc, which determines the necessary level of vaccine uptake that lead to COVID-19 eradication is determined. Furthermore, a herd immunity threshold above which the population can be protected from COVID-19 infection is derived. Analyzing the model, sufficient and necessary conditions for the eradication of the disease are obtained as well. Next, we perform numerical simulations to study the impact of several uptake levels of the potential vaccine on the persistence and the extinction of COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the COVID-19 is expected to last past 2021 in the absence of a vaccination program. Moreover, a vaccination of the adult population at rate 0.6% per day needs at least 67% of vaccine efficacy and 90% of immunogenicity rate to eradicate the disease. Using Sinopharm vaccine, the herd immunity can be achieved when about half of Moroccan adult population is immunized against the COVID-19. However, using Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, less than 60% of adult population must be immunized against the disease to achieve the herd immunity. Finally, if vaccine efficacy is about 80% and the immunogenicity is about 50% then vaccinating adults at rate of 0.6% per day could protect roughly 22% of children from COVID-19 infection.",Aayah Hammoumi; Hanane Hmarrass; Redouane Qesmi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253555,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253555,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
174,"An integrated analysis of contact tracing and genomics to assess the efficacy of travel restrictions on SARS-CoV-2 introduction and transmission in England from June to September, 2020","BackgroundMitigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from international travel is a priority. Travellers from countries with travel restrictions (closed travel-corridors) were required to quarantine for 14 days over Summer 2020 in England. We describe the genomic epidemiology of travel-related cases in England and evaluate the effectiveness of this travel policy.

MethodsBetween 27/05/2020 and 13/09/2020, probable travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cases and their contacts were identified and combined with UK SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. The epidemiology and demographics of cases was identified, and the number of contacts per case modelled using negative binomial regression to estimate the effect of travel restriction, and any variation by age, sex and calendar date. Unique travel-related SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the COG-UK dataset were identified to estimate the effect travel restrictions on cluster size generated from these. The Polecat Clustering Tool was used to identify a travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cluster of infection.

Findings4,207 travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cases are identified. 51.2% (2155/4207) of cases reported travel to one of three countries; 21.0% (882) Greece, 16.3% (685) Croatia and 14.0% (589) Spain. Median number of contacts per case was 3 (IQR 1-5), and greatest for the 16-20 age-group (9.0, 95% C.I.=5.6-14.5), which saw the largest attenuation by travel restriction. Travel restriction was associated with a 40% (rate ratio=0.60, 95% C.I.=0.37-0.95) lower rate of contacts. 827/4207 (19.7%) of cases had high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes available. Fewer genomically-linked cases were observed for index cases related to countries with travel restrictions compared to cases from non-travel restriction countries (rate ratio=0.17, 95% C.I.=0.05-0.52). A large travel-related cluster dispersed across England is identified through genomics, confirmed with contact-tracing data.

InterpretationThis study demonstrates the efficacy of travel restriction policy in reducing the onward transmission of imported cases.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Web of Science and Scopus for the terms (COVID-19 OR SARS-COV-2) AND (imported or importation) AND (sequenc* OR genom* or WGS). We filtered the 55 articles identified through this search and rejected any that did not undertake SARS-CoV-2 sequencing as part of an epidemiological investigation for importation into a different country. The remaining 20 papers were reviewed in greater detail to understand the patterns of importation and the methods used in each case.

Added value of this studyThis is the first published study on importations of SARS-CoV-2 into England using genomics. Plessis et al., (2021) used a predictive model to infer the number of importations in to the UK from all SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated before 26th June 2020. The current study assesses the period 27/05/2020 to 13/09/2020 and presents findings of case-reported travel linked to genomic data. Two unpublished reports exist for Wales and Scotland, although only examine a comparatively small number of importations.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis large-scale study has a number of findings that are pertinent to public health and of global significance, not available from prior evidence to our knowledge. The study demonstrates travel restrictions, through the implementation of  travel-corridors, are effective in reducing the number of contacts per case based on observational data. Age has a significant effect on the number of contacts and this can be mitigated with travel restrictions. Analysis of divergent clusters indicates travel restrictions can reduce the number of onwards cases following a travel-associated case. Analysis of divergent clusters can allow for importations to be identified from genomics, as subsequently evidenced by cluster characteristics derived from contact tracing. The majority of importations of SARS-CoV-2 in England over Summer 2020 were from coastal European countries. The highest number of cases and onward contacts were from Greece, which was largely exempt from self-isolation requirements (bar some islands in September at the end of the study period). Systematic monitoring of imported SARS-CoV-2 cases would help refine implementation of travel restrictions. Finally, along with multiple studies, this study highlights the use of genomics to monitor and track importations of SARS-CoV-2 mutations of interest; this will be of particular use as the repertoire of clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants expand over time and globally.",Dinesh Aggarwal; Andrew J Page; Ulf Schaefer; George M Savva; Richard Myers; Erik Volz; Nicholas Ellaby; Steven Platt; Natalie Groves; Eileen Gallaghar; Niamh M.

A cohort analysis.,"BackgroundAfter infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and virus-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) develop. This study describes antibody responses in a cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients to identify predictors.

MethodsWe recruited patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from Heidelberg, Germany. Blood samples were collected three weeks after COVID-19 symptoms ended. Participants with high antibody titers were invited for follow-up visits. IgG titers were measured by the Euroimmun Assay, and nAbs titers in a SARS-CoV-2 infection-based assay.

Results281 participants were enrolled between April and August 2020 with IgG testing, 145 (51.6%) had nAbs, and 35 (12.5%) had follow-up. The median IgG optical density (OD) ratio was 3.1 (Interquartile range (IQR) 1.6-5.1), and 24.1% (35/145) had a nAb titer>1:80. Higher IgG titers were associated with increased age and more severe disease, and higher nAbs were associated with male gender and CT-value of 25-30 on RT-PCR at diagnosis. The median IgG OD ratio on follow-up was 3.7 (IQR 2.9-5.9), a median increase of 0.5 (IQR -0.3-1.7). Six participants with follow-up nAbs all had titers [&le;] 1:80.

177,A feasible and more efficient SARS-Cov-2 vaccine allocation to states and counties in the USA,"While discussion of vaccine allocation has centered around who should be prioritized (e.g., health care personnel and the elderly), we argue that vaccines should also be allocated to jurisdictions (e.g., counties within the USA) with the greatest immunization thresholds needed for ending the epidemic. At the current rate of vaccine distribution (March 15, 2021), universal herd immunity in the USA could be reached in roughly 4.5 months. However, distributing vaccines according to where the virus spreads more easily (dense counties with high R0 values), herd immunity would be reached simultaneously in all counties almost two months earlier and would require roughly 40% fewer vaccine doses. Furthermore, under the current distribution strategy densely populated counties would reach herd immunity last, with negative epidemiological and socio-economic consequences. In sum, it would be more fair and efficient to distribute vaccines to jurisdictions that need them most to reach herd immunity.",Anthony R Ives; Claudio Bozzuto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253793,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253793,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
178,Estimating the increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain over previously circulating strains in England using fractions of GISAID sequences and the distribution of serial intervals,"The B.1.1.7 strain, a variant strain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is thought to have higher transmissibility than previously circulating strains in England. The fraction of the B.1.1.7 strain among SARS-CoV-2 viruses in England have grown rapidly. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains using the time course of the fraction of B.1.1.7 strains. Based on Wallinga-Teuniss method to estimate the instantaneous reproduction numbers, our method allows the reproduction number to change during the target period of analysis. Our approach is also based on the Maynard Smiths model of allele frequencies in adaptive evolution, which assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant over time. Applying this method to the sequence data in England using serial intervals of COVID-19, we found that the transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain is 40% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 40% to 41%) higher than previously circulating strains in England. The date of the emergence of B.1.1.7 strains in England was estimated to be September 20, 2020 with its 95% CI from September 11 to September 20, 2020. The result indicated that the control measure against the B.1.1.7 strain needs to be strengthened by 40% from that against previously circulating strains.

Although it provides rapid viral detection and can inform SARS-CoV-2 abundance in wastewater, this approach lacks the resolution required for viral genotyping and does not support tracking of viral genome evolution. The recent emergence of several variants of concern, a result of mutations across the genome including the accrual of important mutations within the viral spike glycoprotein, has highlighted the need for a method capable of detecting the cohort of mutations associated with these and newly emerging genotypes. Here we provide an innovative methodology for the recovery of a near-complete SARS-CoV-2 sequence from a wastewater sample collected from across Canadian municipalities including one that experienced a significant outbreak attributable to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Our results demonstrate that a combined interrogation of genome consensus-level sequences and alternative alleles enables the identification of a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern and the detection of a new allele within a viral accessory gene that may be representative of a recently evolved B.1.1.7 sublineage.",Chrystal Landgraff; Lu Ya Ruth Wang; Cody Buchanan; Matthew Wells; Justin Schonfeld; Kyrylo Bessonov; Jennifer Ali; Erin Robert; Celine Nadon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253409,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253409,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
180,THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ACB-IP 1.0 UNIVERSAL PATHOGEN FREE CONCENTRATED COCKTAIL CONVALESCENT PLASMA IN COVID-19 INFECTION,"Abstract Introduction The efficacy of SARS-CoV2 standard single donor convalescent plasma varied according to the application time and most importantly the amount of antibody that is administered. Single donor plasma has some drawbacks; such as the insufficient levels of neutralizing antibody activities, the requirements of blood group compatibility, and the risk of infection transmission. In this study, the efficacy and safety of pathogen inactivated, isohemagglutinin-depleted (concentrated) and pooled convalescent plasma was investigated. Methods In this study, ACB-IP 1.0 convalescent plasma product was prepared as follows; first, convalescent plasma was collected from different donors, then pathogen-inactivation was carried-out, and isohemagglutinins were cryodepleted, respectively. Finally, concentrated convalescent plasma product was pooled and stored until use. A total of sixteen patients were treated with two different convalescent plasma products. Nine patients were treated with standard single donor convalescent plasma and seven were treated with pathogen-free, concentrated, pooled convalescent plasma (ACB-IP 1.0) between 01 April 2020 and 31 December 2020. The outcomes of these two plasma products were compared regarding SARS-CoV2 antibody titers, neutralizing antibody activities, length of hospitalization and mortality rates. Results Five out of six single donor plasma SARS-CoV2 antibody titers remained below 12 s/co, but the antibody titers of all ACB-IP 1.0 plasma were above 12 s/co. SARS-CoV2 total antibody titers of ACB-IP 1.0 plasma were statistically higher than the antibody titers of single donor plasma. Mean total plasma neutralizing antibody activity of ACB-IP 1.0 plasma (1.5421) was found statistically higher than single donor plasma (0.9642) in 1:256 dilution ({rho}=0.0087) The mortality rate of the patients treated with ACB-IP 1.0 plasma showed statistically lower (p: 0,033) than the patients treated with single donor plasma. The administration of either single donor plasma or ACB-IP 1.0 plasma to the patients within eight days significantly shortened the length of hospitalization compared to administration of either plasma to the patients later than eight days ({rho}= 0,0021) Discussion Pathogen-free, concentrated, pooled convalescent plasma may resolve the bias in SARS-CoV2 antibody titers and neutralizing antibody activities, without requiring blood group compatibility that allows patient accessibility in a shorter time and has safe plasma characteristic. This study indicates that ACB-IP 1.0 may be a superior product compared to standard single donor plasma.",Cansu Hemsinlioglu; Nil Banu Pelit; Koray Yalcin; Omur Selin Gunaydin; Nihal Ozturk Sahin; Esra Savas Karagacli; Omer Elibol; Sefa Onur Demir; Evren Safak; Raife Dilek Turan; Goncagul Celebi; Miyase Ezgi Kocaoglu; Gozde Sir Karakus; Bulut Yurtsever; Cihan Tastan; Selen Abanuz; Didem Cakirsoy; Derya Dilek Kancagi; Zeynep Torun; Utku Seyis; Muhammer Elek; Rehile Zengin; Ayse Sesin Kocagoz; Caglar Cuhadaroglu; Nur Birgen; Siret Ratip; Ercument Ovali,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21251413,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21251413,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
181,High risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19 with frequently encountered spontaneous breathing patterns: a computational modelling study,"BackgroundThere is ongoing controversy regarding the potential for increased respiratory effort to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%).

ResultsSimulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and to 240.5 J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that the forces generated during increased inspiratory effort in severe COVID-19 are compatible with the development of P-SILI. If conventional oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of driving and transpulmonary pressures with invasive ventilation may reduce the risk of P-SILI and allow time for the resolution of the underlying condition.",Anup Das; Liam Weaver; Sina Saffaran; Nadir Yehya; Timothy E.

182,Knowledge barriers in the symptomatic-COVID-19 testing programme in the UK: an observational study,"BackgroundSymptomatic testing programmes are crucial to the COVID-19 pandemic response. We sought to examine United Kingdom (UK) testing rates amongst individuals with test-qualifying symptoms, and factors associated with not testing.

MethodsWe analysed a cohort of untested symptomatic app users (N=1,237), nested in the Zoe COVID Symptom Study (Zoe, N= 4,394,948); and symptomatic survey respondents who wanted, but did not have a test (N=1,956), drawn from the University of Maryland-Facebook Covid-19 Symptom Survey (UMD-Facebook, N=775,746).

FindingsThe proportion tested among individuals with incident test-qualifying symptoms rose from [~]20% to [~]75% from April to December 2020 in Zoe. Testing was lower with one vs more symptoms (73.0% vs 85.0%), or short vs long symptom duration (72.6% vs 87.8%). 40.4% of survey respondents did not identify all three test-qualifying symptoms. Symptom identification decreased for every decade older (OR=0.908 [95% CI 0.883-0.933]). Amongst symptomatic UMD-Facebook respondents who wanted but did not have a test, not knowing where to go was the most cited factor (32.4%); this increased for each decade older (OR=1.207 [1.129-1.292]) and for every 4-years fewer in education (OR=0.685 [0.599-0.783]).

InterpretationDespite current UK messaging on COVID-19 testing, there is a knowledge gap about when and where to test, and this may be contributing to the [~]25% testing gap. Risk factors, including older age and less education, highlight potential opportunities to tailor public health messages.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo assess current evidence on test uptake in symptomatic testing programmes, and the reasons for not testing, we searched PubMed from database inception for research using the keywords (COVID-19) AND (testing) AND ((access) OR (uptake)). We did not find any work reporting on levels of test uptake amongst symptomatic individuals. We found three papers investigating geographic barriers to testing. We found one US based survey reporting on knowledge barriers to testing, and one UK based survey reporting on barriers in the period March - August 2020. Neither of these studies were able to combine testing behaviour with prospectively collected symptom reports from the users surveyed.

Added value of this studyThrough prospective collection of symptom and test reports, we were able to estimate testing uptake amongst individuals with test-qualifying symptoms in the UK. Our results indicate that whilst testing has improved since the start of the pandemic, there remains a considerable testing gap. Investigating this gap we find that individuals with just one test-qualifying symptom or short symptom duration are less likely to get tested. We also find knowledge barriers to testing: a substantial proportion of individuals do not know which symptoms qualify them for a COVID-19 test, and do not know where to seek testing. We find a larger knowledge gap in individuals with older age and fewer years of education.

Implications of all the available evidenceDespite the UK having a simple set of symptom-based testing criteria, with tests made freely available through nationalised healthcare, a quarter of individuals with qualifying symptoms do not get tested. Our findings suggest testing uptake may be limited by individuals not acting on mild or transient symptoms, not recognising the testing criteria, and not knowing where to get tested. Improved messaging may help address this testing gap, with opportunities to target individuals of older age or fewer years of education. Messaging may prove even more valuable in countries with more fragmented testing infrastructure or more nuanced testing criteria, where knowledge barriers are likely to be greater.",Mark S Graham; Anna May; Thomas Varsavsky; Carole Sudre; Benjamin Murray; Kerstin Klaser; Michela Antonelli; Liane Canas; Erika Molteni; Marc Modat; David Alden Drew; Long Nguyen; Benjamin Rader; Christina Hu; Joan Capdevila; Alexander Hammers; Andrew Chan; Jonathan Wolf; John Brownstein; Timothy Spector; Sebastien Ourselin; Claire Steves; Christina Astley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253719,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253719,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
183,In vivo evaluation of the virucidal efficacy of Chlorhexidine and Povidone-iodine mouthwashes against salivary SARS-CoV-2.,"BackgroundThe oral cavity is potentially high-risk transmitter of COVID-19. Antimicrobial mouthrinses are used in many clinical pre procedural situations for prophylactic purposes. An evident-based investigation for an effective mouthwash solution against salivary SARS-CoV-2 is urgently required for the exposure reduction during dental procedures.

AimsThis study aimed to evaluate in vivo virucidal efficacy of 2 mouthwashes: 1% Povidoneiodine and 0.2% Chlorhexidine as a dental preprocedural oral disinfection against salivary SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and MethodsIn this randomized-controlled clinical trial, studied group comprised laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive patients through nasopharyngeal swabs. Participants were divided into 3 groups. For 30 seconds, group A gargled with 1% Povidone-iodine, group B mouthrinsed with 0.2% Chlorhexidine and control group C mouthrinsed with distilled water. Saliva samples were collected before and 5 minutes after mouthwash. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR was then performed for each sample. Evaluation of the efficacy was based on difference in Ct value. The analysis of data was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows. Paired t test and unpaired t test were used. A probability value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

ResultsSixty-one compliant participants (36 female and 25 male) with a mean age 45.3 {+/-} 16.7 years-old were enrolled. A significant mean Ct value difference (p < 0.0001) between the paired samples in group A (n = 25) and also in group B (n = 27) (p < 0.0001) was found. In contrast, no significant difference (p = 0.566) existed before and after the experiment in the control group C (n = 9). Moreover, a significant difference was noted between the delta Ct of distilled water wash and each of the 2 solutions 1 % Povidone-iodine (p = 0.012) and Chlorhexidine 0.2% (p = 0.0024). No significant difference was found between the delta Ct of patients using 1% Povidone-iodine and Chlorhexidine 0.2% solutions (p = 0.24).

ConclusionChlorhexidine 0.2% and 1% Povidone-iodine oral solutions are effective preprocedural mouthwashes against salivary SARS-COV-2 in dental treatments. Their use as a preventive strategy to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during dental practice should be systematically implemented.",Rola ElZein; fadi Abdel Sater; Soha Fakhreddine; Pierre Abi Hanna; Rita Feghali; Hassan Hamad; Fouad Ayoub,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21252302,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21252302,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True

Here we report the biophysical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 spike variants D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with affinities to the ACE2 receptor and infectivity capacity, revealing weaknesses in the developed neutralising antibody approaches. Furthermore, we report a pre-clinical characterisation package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert, with broad neutralisation capacity, that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19.

186,Identification of ACE2 mutations that modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike binding across multiple mammalian species,"Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with different mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) cell entry receptors will help elucidate determinants of intra- and cross-species virus transmission, facilitate development of effective new vaccines for both humans and livestock animals, and guide livestock farming and coronavirus screening procedures to ensure food supply security. In this work we applied laboratory directed evolution to several mammalian ACE2s with the goal of identifying conserved ACE2 mutations that increase spike binding affinity across multiple species. We found the Gln42Leu mutation increased ACE2-spike binding for human as well as four of four other mammalian ACE2s, while the Leu79Ile mutation had a similar effect for human and three of three mammalian ACE2 orthologs. These results are especially notable given the residues high levels of representation, i.e, 83% for Gln42 and 56% for Leu79, among annotated mammalian ACE2s. We also found that substitutions at ACE2 position 34, which is relatively variable across mammalian ACE2s, increased binding for multiple ACE2 orthologs. Taken together, these results speak strongly to the plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 strains with increased ability to cross species transmission barriers.

Structural characterisation of the Spike carrying point mutations aids in our understanding of how these mutations impact binding of the protein to its human receptor, ACE2, and to therapeutic antibodies. The Spike G485R mutation has been observed in multiple isolates of the virus and mutation of the adjacent residue E484 to lysine is known to contribute to antigenic escape. Here, we have crystallised the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain with a G485R mutation in complex with human ACE2. The crystal structure shows that while the G485 residue does not have a direct interaction with ACE2, its mutation to arginine affects the structure of the loop made by residues 480-488 in the receptor-binding motif, disrupting the interactions of neighbouring residues with ACE2 and with potential implications for antigenic escape from vaccines, antibodies and other biologics directed against SARS-CoV-2 Spike.",Claire Marie Weekley; Damian Francis John Purcell; Michael W Parker,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.434488,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.434488,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,False
188,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces inflammation via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway,"Pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response; however, the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly understood. Here we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNFa, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and neucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human lung epithelial cells A549 also produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly are non-inflammatory, but elicit an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway is abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein induces IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1 {beta} in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Together these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.",Shahanshah Khan; Mahnoush S.

189,Longitudinal characterization of humoral and cellular immunity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients reveal immune persistence up to 9 months after infection,"BackgroundInsights into early, specific humoral and cellular responses to infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as the persistence and magnitude of resulting immune memory is important amidst the ongoing pandemic. The combination of humoral and cellular immunity will most likely contribute to protection from reinfection or severe disease.

MethodsHere, we conducted a longitudinal study on hospitalized moderate and severe COVID-19 patients from the acute phase of disease into convalescence at five- and nine-months post symptom onset. Utilizing flow cytometry, serological assays as well as B cell and T cell FluoroSpot assays, we assessed the magnitude and specificity of humoral and cellular immune memory during and after human SARS-CoV-2 infection.

FindingsDuring acute COVID-19, we observed an increase in germinal center activity, a substantial expansion of antibodysecreting cells, and the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Despite gradually decreasing antibody levels, we show persistent, neutralizing antibody titers as well as robust specific memory B cell responses and polyfunctional T cell responses at five- and nine-months after symptom onset in both moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. Long-term SARS-CoV-2 specific responses were marked by preferential targeting of spike over nucleocapsid protein.

These newly emerged variants have mutations in their spike (S) protein that may confer resistance to vaccine-elicited immunity and existing neutralizing antibody therapeutics. Therefore, there is still an urgent need of safe, effective, and affordable agents for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and its variant infection. Here, we demonstrated that green tea beverage (GTB) or its major ingredient, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), were highly effective in inhibiting infection of live SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus (HCoV OC43). In addition, infection of the pseudoviruses with spikes of the new variants (UK-B.1.1.7, SA-B.1.351, and CA-B.1.429) was efficiently blocked by GTB or EGCG. Among the 4 active green tea catechins at noncytotoxic doses, EGCG was the most potent in the action against the viruses. The highest inhibitory activity was observed when the viruses or the cells were pre-incubated with EGCG prior to the infection. Mechanistic studies revealed that EGCG blocked infection at the entry step through interfering with the engagement of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spikes to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host cells. These data support further clinical evaluation and development of EGCG as a novel, safe, and cost-effective natural product for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection.",Jinbiao Liu; Brittany H Bodnar; Feng-Zhen Meng; Adil Khan; Xu Wang; Guangxiang George Luo; Sami Saribas; Tao Wang; Saroj Chandra Lohani; Peng Wang; Zhengyu Wei; Jinjun Luo; Lina Zhou; Jianguo Wu; Qingsheng Li; Wenhui Hu; Wenzhe Ho,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435637,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435637,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,False

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been shown to own promising potential in clinically combating SARS-CoV-2 but the underlying mechanisms still remain almost unknown. So far, all action sites are proposed on the host cells, and in particular no specific viral target protein has been experimentally identified. In this study, by use of DIC microscopy and NMR spectroscopy, for the first time we have decoded that HCQ specifically binds to both N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein to inhibit their interactions with nucleic acids (NAs), as well as to disrupt its NA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) essential for the viral life cycle including the package of gRNA and N protein into new virions. These results suggest that HCQ may achieve its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by interfering in several key steps of the viral life cycle. The study not only provides a structural basis for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HCQ, but also indicates that SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its LLPS represent key targets for further optimization and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.",Mei Dang; Jianxing Song,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435741,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435741,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,False
192,"The Influence of Covid-19 Vaccine on Daily Cases, Hospitalization, and Death Rate in Tennessee: A Case Study in the United States","The COVID-19 outbreak highlights the vulnerability to novel infections, and vaccination remains a foreseeable method to return to normal life. However, infrastructure is inadequate for the whole population to be vaccinated immediately. Therefore, policies have adopted a strategy to vaccinate the elderly and vulnerable population while delaying others. This study uses the Tennessee official statistic from the onset of COVID vaccination (17th of December 2021) to understand how age-specific vaccination strategies reduce daily cases, hospitalization, and death rate. The result shows that vaccination strategy can significantly influence the numbers of patients with COVID-19 in all age groups and lower hospitalization and death rates just in older age groups.

The Hospitalization rate was reduced by 80% in this study cohort for people aged 80 or older, while people who were between 50 to 70 had almost the same hospitalization rate.

193,The impact of policy timing on the spread of COVID-19,"We model COVID-19 data for 89 nations and US states with a recently developed formalism that describes mathematically any pattern of growth with the minimum number of parameters. The results show that the disease has a typical duration of 18 days, with a significant increase in fatality when it lasts longer than about 4 months. Searching for correlations between ""flattening of the curve"" and preventive public policies, we find strong statistical evidence for the impact of the first implemented policy on decreasing the pandemic growth rate; a delay of one week in implementation nearly triples the size of the infected population, on average. Without any government action, the initial outburst still slows down after 36 days, possibly thanks to changes in public behavior in response to the pandemic toll. Stay-at-home (lockdown) was not the first policy of any sample member and we do not find statistically meaningful evidence for its added impact, similar to a recent study that employed an entirely different approach. However, lockdown was mostly imposed only shortly before the exponential rise was arrested. The possibility remains that lockdown might have shortened significantly the initial exponential rise had it been employed as first, rather than last resort.",Moshe Elitzur; Scott Kaplan; Zeljko Ivezic; David Zilberman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253764,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253764,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
194,Characteristics and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 among children in Italy: a cross-sectional study in 20 pediatric centers,"BackgroundNo study has described factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in children.

AimDescribe characteristics and risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis in children tested in 20 pediatric centers across Italy.

MethodsCases aged 0-18 years tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 23 and May 24 2020 were included. Our primary analysis focused on children tested because of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms.

ResultsAmong 2494 children tested for SARS-CoV-2, 2148 (86.1%) had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 included - beside fever (82.4%) and respiratory signs or symptoms (60.4%) - also gastrointestinal (18.2%), neurological (18.9%), cutaneous (3.8%) and other flu-like presentations (17.8%). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 were: exposure history (adjusted OR 39.83 95%CI 17.52-90.55 p<0.0001), cardiac disease (adjusted OR 3.10 95%CI 1.19-5.02 p<0.0001), fever (adjusted OR 3.05 % 95% CI 1.67-5.58 p=0.0003), and anosmia/ageusia (OR 4.08 95%CI 1.69 -9.84 p=0.002). Among 190 (7.6%) children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, only four (2.1%) required respiratory support and two (1.1%) were admitted in ICU, while 100% recovered.

ConclusionRecommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing in children should be updated based on the evidence of broader clinical features. Exposure history, fever, and anosmia/ageusia are strong risk factors for COVID-19 in children, while other symptoms dont seem helping discriminating in between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the negative cases. This study confirm that COVID-19 is a mild disease in the general population of children in Italy.

195,Interim results of the safety and immune-efficacy of 1 versus 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 for cancer patients in the context of the UK vaccine priority guidelines,"BackgroundThe efficacy and safety profile of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been definitively established in immunocompromised patient populations. Patients with a known cancer diagnosis were hitherto excluded from trials of the vaccines currently in clinical use.

MethodsThis study presents data on the safety and immune efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in 54 healthy controls and 151 mostly elderly patients with solid and haematological malignancies, respectively, and compares results for patients who were boosted with BNT162b2 at 3 weeks versus those who were not. Immune efficacy was measured as antibody seroconversion, T cell responses, and neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and of a variant of concern (VOC) (B.1.1.7). We also collected safety data for the BNT162b2 vaccine up to 5 weeks following first dose.

FindingsThe vaccine was largely well tolerated. However, in contrast to its very high performance in healthy controls (>90% efficacious), immune efficacy of a single inoculum in solid cancer patients was strikingly low (below 40%) and very low in haematological cancer patients (below 15%). Of note, efficacy in solid cancer patients was greatly and rapidly increased by boosting at 21-days (95% within 2 weeks of boost). Too few haematological cancer patients were boosted for clear conclusions to be drawn.

ConclusionsDelayed boosting potentially leaves most solid and haematological cancer patients wholly or partially unprotected, with implications for their own health; their environment and the evolution of VOC strains. Prompt boosting of solid cancer patients quickly overcomes the poor efficacy of the primary inoculum in solid cancer patients.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSome cancer patients have been shown to exhibit sustained immune dysregulation, inefficient seroconversion and prolonged viral shedding as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Consequently, their exclusion and, in particular, the exclusion of patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapies, from the registry trials of the 5 approved COVID-19 vaccines raises questions about the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in this patient population. In addition, whilst the change in the UKs dosing interval to 12-weeks aimed to maximise population coverage, it is unclear whether this strategy is appropriate for cancer patients and those on systemic anti-cancer therapies.

Added value of this studyWe report that the RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine administered in cancer patients was well tolerated, and we provide first insights into both antibody and T cell responses to the vaccine in an immunocompromised patient population.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn cancer patients, one dose of 30ug of BNT162b2 yields poor vaccine efficacy, as measured by seroconversion rates, viral neutralisation capacity and T cell responses, at 3- and 5-weeks following the first inoculum. Patients with solid cancers exhibited a significantly greater response following a booster at 21-days. These data support prioritisation of cancer patients for an early (21-day) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Given the globally poor responses to vaccination in patients with haematological cancers, post-vaccination serological testing, creation of herd immunity around these patients using a strategy of  ring vaccination, and careful follow-up should be prioritised.",Leticia Monin-Aldama; Adam G.

196,"U.S. adolescents' mental health and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, Fall 2020","Preliminary reports suggest that during COVID-19, adolescents mental health has worsened while technology and social media use has increased. Much data derives from early in the pandemic, when schools were uniformly remote and personal/family stressors related to the pandemic were limited. This cross-sectional study, conducted during Fall 2020, examines the correlation between mental wellbeing and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, along with influence of COVID-19-related stressors, school status (in-person versus remote), and social media use for coping purposes, among 978 U.S. adolescents. Results suggest self-reported daily social media and technology use increased significantly from prior to COVID-19 through Fall 2020. Increased social media use was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms regardless of other theoretical moderators or confounders of mental health (e.g., demographics, school status, importance of technology, COVID-19-related stress). Despite literature suggesting that remote learning may result in adverse mental health outcomes, we did not find local school reopening to be associated with current depressive/anxiety symptoms, nor with COVID-19-related increases in technology use. Self-reported use of social media for coping purposes moderated the association between increased social media use and mental health symptoms; in other words, some social media use may have positive effects. Although much prior research has focused on social media use as a marker of stress, we also found that increased video gaming and TV/movie watching were also associated with internalizing symptoms, in accordance with others' work. Future research should explore in more granular detail what, if any, social media and technology use is protective during a pandemic, and for whom, to help tailor prevention efforts.",Taylor A Burke; Emily R Kutok; Shira Dunsiger; Nicole R Nugent; John V Patena; Alison Riese; Megan L Ranney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253598,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253598,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True

A temporal glimpse at sewage viral genome helps as diagnostic tool to understand the viral spread at community level. In this study, for the long-term epidemiological surveillance, we monitored the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in domestic sewage by adopting the longitudinal sampling to represent a selected community ([~]1.8 lakhs population which occupies 1.79% of the total population of Hyderabad city) to understand the dynamics of infection. Dynamics and spread of COVID-19 outbreak within the selected community were achieved by studying the longitudinal sampling for a specific period of time.

198,Elicitation of broadly protective sarbecovirus immunity by receptor-binding domain nanoparticle vaccines,"Understanding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited antibodies to neutralize and protect against emerging variants of concern and other sarbecoviruses is key for guiding vaccine development decisions and public health policies. We show that a clinical stage multivalent SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain nanoparticle vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP) protects mice from SARS-CoV-2-induced disease after a single shot, indicating that the vaccine could allow dose-sparing. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP elicits high antibody titers in two non-human primate (NHP) models against multiple distinct RBD antigenic sites known to be recognized by neutralizing antibodies. We benchmarked NHP serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NP against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen using a panel of single-residue spike mutants detected in clinical isolates as well as the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are resilient to most RBD mutations tested, but the E484K substitution has similar negative consequences for neutralization, and exhibit modest but comparable neutralization breadth against distantly related sarbecoviruses. We demonstrate that mosaic and cocktail sarbecovirus RBD-NPs elicit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, including against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, and protect mice against severe SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of the SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine. This study provides proof of principle that sarbecovirus RBD-NPs induce heterotypic protection and enables advancement of broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines to the clinic.",Alexandra C Walls; Marcos C Miranda; Minh N Pham; Alexandra Schaefer; Allison Greaney; Prabhu S Arunachalam; Mary-Jane Navarro; M.

199,Cluster Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Gene using Deep Learning Autoencoder: Gene Profiling for Mutations and Transitions,"We report on a method for analyzing the variant of coronavirus genes using autoencoder. Since coronaviruses have mutated rapidly and generated a large number of genotypes, an appropriate method for understanding the entire population is required. The method using autoencoder meets this requirement and is suitable for understanding how and when the variants emarge and disappear. For the over 30,000 SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene sequences sampled globally from December 2019 to February 2021, we were able to represent a summary of their characteristics in a 3D plot and show the expansion, decline, and transformation of the virus types over time and by region. Based on ORF1ab genes, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses were classified into five major types (A, B, C, D, and E in the order of appearance): the virus type that originated in China at the end of 2019 (type A) practically disappeared in June 2020; two virus types (types B and C) have emerged in the United States and Europe since February 2020, and type B has become a global phenomenon. Type C is only prevalent in the U.S. and is suspected to be associated with high mortality, but this type also disappeared at the end of June. Type D is only found in Australia.

200,Design and proof-of-concept for targeted phage-based COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a streamlined cold-free supply chain,"Development of effective vaccines against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global imperative. Rapid immunization of the world human population against a widespread, continually evolving, and highly pathogenic virus is an unprecedented challenge, and many different vaccine approaches are being pursued to meet this task. Engineered filamentous bacteriophage (phage) have unique potential in vaccine development due to their inherent immunogenicity, genetic plasticity, stability, cost-effectiveness for large-scale production, and proven safety profile in humans. Herein we report the design, development, and initial evaluation of targeted phage-based vaccination approaches against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by using dual ligand peptide-targeted phage and adeno-associated virus/phage (AAVP) particles. Towards a unique phage- and AAVP-based dual-display candidate approach, we first performed structure-guided antigen design to select six solvent-exposed epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein for display on the recombinant major capsid coat protein pVIII. Targeted phage particles carrying one of these epitopes induced a strong and specific humoral response. In an initial experimental approach, when these targeted phage particles were further genetically engineered to simultaneously display a ligand peptide (CAKSMGDIVC) on the minor capsid protein pIII, which enables receptor-mediated transport of phage particles from the lung epithelium into the systemic circulation (termed ""dual-display""), they enhanced a systemic and specific spike (S) protein-specific antibody response upon aerosolization into the lungs of mice. In a second line of investigation, we engineered targeted AAVP particles to deliver the entire S protein gene under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which induced tissue-specific transgene expression stimulating a systemic S protein-specific antibody response. As proof-of-concept preclinical experiments, we show that targeted phage- and AAVP-based particles serve as robust yet versatile enabling platforms for ligand-directed immunization and promptly yield COVID-19 vaccine prototypes for further translational development.

SignificanceThe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has accounted for over 2.5 million deaths and an unprecedented impact on the health of mankind worldwide. Over the past several months, while a few COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization and are currently being administered to the entire human population, the demand for prompt global immunization has created enormous logistical challenges--including but not limited to supply, access, and distribution--that justify and reinforce the research for additional strategic alternatives. Phage are viruses that only infect bacteria and have been safely administered to humans as antibiotics for decades. As experimental proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that aerosol pulmonary vaccination with lung-targeted phage particles that display short epitopes of the S protein on the capsid as well as preclinical vaccination with targeted AAVP particles carrying the S protein gene elicit a systemic and specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompetent mice. Given that targeted phage- and AAVP-based viral particles are sturdy yet simple to genetically engineer, cost-effective for rapid large-scale production in clinical grade, and relatively stable at room temperature, such unique attributes might perhaps become additional tools towards COVID-19 vaccine design and development for immediate and future unmet needs.",Daniela I.

Amplicon-based sequencing methods provide a sensitive, low-cost and rapid approach but suffer a high potential for contamination, which can undermine lab processes and results. This challenge will only increase with expanding global production of sequences by diverse research groups for epidemiological and clinical interpretation. We present an approach which uses synthetic DNA spike-ins (SDSIs) to track samples and detect inter-sample contamination through a sequencing workflow. Applying this approach to the ARTIC Consortiums amplicon design, we define a series of best practices for Illumina-based sequencing and provide a detailed characterization of approaches to increase sensitivity for low-viral load samples incorporating the SDSIs.

202,3D genomic capture of regulatory immuno-genetic profiles in COVID-19 patients for prognosis of severe COVID disease outcome,"Human infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A striking characteristic of COVID-19 infection in humans is the highly variable host response and the diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from clinically asymptomatic to severe immune reactions leading to hospitalization and death. Here we used a 3D genomic approach to analyse blood samples at the time of COVID diagnosis, from a global cohort of 80 COVID-19 patients, with different degrees of clinical disease outcomes. Using 3D whole genome EpiSwitch(R) arrays to generate over 1 million data points per patient, we identified a distinct and measurable set of differences in genomic organization at immune-related loci that demonstrated prognostic power at baseline to stratify patients with mild forms of illness and those with severe forms that required hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) support. Further analysis revealed both well established and new COVID-related dysregulated pathways and loci, including innate and adaptive immunity; ACE2; olfactory, G{beta}{psi}, Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) signalling; prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the acute inflammatory cytokine CCL3, and the T-cell derived chemotactic cytokine CCL5. We identified potential therapeutic agents for mitigation of severe disease outcome, with several already being tested independently, including mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and tacrolimus) and general immunosuppressants (dexamethasone and hydrocortisone). Machine learning algorithms based on established EpiSwitch(R) methodology further identified a subset of 3D genomic changes that could be used as prognostic molecular biomarker leads for the development of a COVID-19 disease severity test.",Ewan Hunter; Christina Koutsothanasi; Adam Wilson; Francisco Coroado Santos; Matthew Salter; Ryan Powell; Ann Dring; Paulina Brajer; Benedict Egan; Jurjen Westra; Aroul Ramadass; William Messner; Amanda Brunton; Zoe Lyski; Rama Vancheeswaran; Andrew Barlow; Dmitri Pchejetski; Alexandre Akoulitchev,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435295,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435295,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
203,Immunoinformatic Approach for the identification of T Cell and B Cell Epitopes in the Surface Glycoprotein and Designing a Potent Multiepitope Vaccine Construct Against SARS-CoV-2 including the new UK variant,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus in China in late 2019 has turned into a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affecting several millions of people worldwide in a short span of time with high fatality. The crisis is further aggravated by the emergence and evolution of new variant SARS-CoV-2 strains in UK during December, 2020 followed by their transmission to other countries. A major concern is that prophylaxis and therapeutics are not available yet to control and prevent the virus which is spreading at an alarming rate, though several vaccine trials are in the final stage. As vaccines are developed through various strategies, their immunogenic potential may drastically vary and thus pose several challenges in offering both arms of immunity such as humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the virus. In this study, we adopted an immunoinformatics-aided identification of B cell and T cell epitopes in the Spike protein, which is a surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, for developing a new Multiepitope vaccine construct (MEVC). MEVC has 575 amino acids and comprises adjuvants and various cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes that possess the highest affinity for the respective HLA alleles, assembled and joined by linkers. The computational data suggest that the MEVC is non-toxic, non-allergenic and thermostable with the capability to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The population coverage of various countries affected by COVID-19 with respect to the selected B and T cell epitopes in MEVC was also investigated. Subsequently, the biological activity of MEVC was assessed by bioinformatic tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptors TLR3 and TLR4. The epitopes of the construct were analyzed with that of the strains belonging to various clades including the new variant UK strain having multiple unique mutations in S protein. Due to the advantageous features, the MEVC can be tested in vitro for more practical validation and the study offers immense scope for developing a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 in view of the public health emergency associated with COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.",Kaveri Krishnasamy; Gracy Fathima Selvaraj; Kiruba Ramesh; Padmaoriya Padmanabhan; Vidya Gopalan; Karthikeyan Govindan; Aswathi Chandran; Srinivasan Sivasubramanian,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435391,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435391,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False

The ongoing surge in available sequence data is however testing the limits of our bioinformatics software. One example is the large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, which are beyond the processing power of many methods, and simulating such large datasets is also proving difficult. Here we present a new algorithm and software for efficiently simulating sequence evolution along extremely large trees (e.g. > 100, 000 tips) when the branches of the tree are short, as is typical in genomic epidemiology. Our algorithm is based on the Gillespie approach, and implements an efficient multi-layered search tree structure that provides high computational efficiency by taking advantage of the fact that only a small proportion of the genome is likely to mutate at each branch of the considered phylogeny.

205,Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease inhibitors through a combination of high-throughput screening and FlipGFP-based reporter assay,"The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. PLpro is involved in the cleavage of viral polyproteins and antagonizing host innate immune response through its deubiquitinating and deISG15ylating activities, rendering it a high profile antiviral drug target. Through a FRET-based high-throughput screening, several hits were identified as PLpro inhibitors with IC50 values at the single-digit micromolar range. Subsequent lead optimization led to potent inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 0.56 to 0.90 {micro}M. To help prioritize lead compounds for the cellular antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-2, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP assay that is suitable for quantifying the intracellular enzymatic inhibition potency of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting. Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP-PLpro assay, Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 hACE2 cells with EC50 values of 8.89 and 8.32 {micro}M, respectively, which were 3-fold more potent than GRL0617 (EC50 = 25.1 {micro}M). The X-ray crystal structures of PLpro in complex with GRL0617 showed that binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 induced a conformational change in the BL2 loop to the more closed conformation. Overall, the PLpro inhibitors identified in this study represent promising starting points for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, and FlipGFP-PLpro assay might be a suitable surrogate for screening PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting.",Zilei Xia; Michael Sacco; Chunlong Ma; Julia Townsend; Naoya Kitamura; Yanmei Hu; Mandy Ba; Tommy Szeto; Xiujun Zhang; Xiangzhi Meng; Fushun Zhang; Yan Xiang; Michael Marty; Yu Chen; Jun Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435551,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435551,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
206,Circular RNA Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and Emerging Variants,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. The emerging variants B.1.1.7 in the UK, B.1.351 in South Africa, and P.1 in Brazil have recently spread rapidly, arousing concerns about the efficacy of the current vaccines and antibody therapies. Therefore, there is still a high demand for alternative vaccines with great efficacy, high design flexibility, and fast manufacturing speed. Here, we reported a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that encodes the trimeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Being a circularized RNA molecule, circRNARBD could be rapidly produced via in vitro transcription and is highly stable without nucleotide modification. Lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated circRNARBD elicited potent and sustained neutralizing antibodies, as well as Th1-biased T cell responses in mice. Notably, antibodies from mice immunized with circRNA encoding RBD variant (K417N-E484K-501Y) effectively neutralized B.1.351 variant. Moreover, we developed therapeutic circRNAs, encoding SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies or hACE2 decoys, which could effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Our study suggests that circular RNA holds the potential to become a novel vaccine and therapeutic platform.",Liang Qu; Zongyi Yi; Yong Shen; Yiyuan Xu; Zeguang Wu; Huixian Tang; Xia Xiao; Xiaojing Dong; Li Guo; Ayijiang Yisimayi; Yunlong Cao; Zhuo Zhou; Jianwei Wang; Xiaoliang Sunney Xie; Wensheng Wei,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435594,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435594,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
207,Killed whole genome-reduced bacteria surface-expressed coronavirus fusion peptide vaccines protect against disease in a porcine model,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rages on, it is important to explore new evolution-resistant vaccine antigens and new vaccine platforms that can produce readily scalable, inexpensive vaccines with easier storage and transport. We report here a synthetic biology-based vaccine platform that employs an expression vector with an inducible Gram-negative autotransporter to express vaccine antigens on surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance interaction of vaccine antigen with immune system. As a proof of principle, we utilized genome-reduced E. coli to express SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) fusion peptide (FP) on the cell surface, and evaluated their use as a killed whole cell vaccine. The FP sequence is highly conserved across coronaviruses; the 6 FP core amino acid residues along with the 4 adjacent residues upstream and the 3 residues downstream the core are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. We tested the efficacy of PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines in a PEDV challenge pig model. We demonstrated that both vaccines induced potent anamnestic responses upon virus challenge, potentiated IFN-{gamma} responses, reduced viral RNA loads in jejunum tissue, and provided significant protection against clinical disease. However, neither vaccines elicited sterilizing immunity. Since SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines provided similar clinical protection, the coronavirus FP could be a target for a broadly-protective vaccine using any platform. Importantly, the genome-reduced bacterial surface-expressed vaccine platform, when using a vaccine appropriate bacterial vector, has potential utility as an inexpensive, readily manufactured, and rapid vaccine platform for other pathogens.

Significance StatementWe report a new vaccine platform to express vaccine antigens on surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. We demonstrated the utility of this vaccine platform by expressing the highly conserved fusion peptide (FP) of SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus on the surface of E.coli to produce killed whole cell bacterial vaccines. The vaccine primes a potent anamnestic response, potentiates IFN-{gamma} responses, and provides significant protection in pigs against disease following virus challenge. The FP could be a target for a broadly-protective coronavirus vaccine since a Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine provided cross-protection against Alphacoronavirus PEDV. When using a vaccine appropriate bacteria vector, this inexpensive new vaccine platform offers the potential for use in developing countries.",Denicar Lina Nascimento Fabris Maeda; Debin Tian; Hanna Yu; Nakul Dar; Vignesh Rajasekaran; Sarah Meng; Hassan Mahsoub; Harini Sooryanarain; Bo Wang; C.

208,"Replication kinetic, cell tropism and associated immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 virus infected human iPSC derived neural models","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with a wide variety of neurological complications. Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and spread, despite ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NPR1 expression in all cultures. However, this sparse infection did result in the production of type-III-interferons and IL-8. In contrast, H5N1 virus replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the CNS.",Lisa Bauer; Bas Lendemeijer; Lonneke Leijten; Carmen W.

209,Rationally designed immunogens enable immune focusing to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif,"Eliciting antibodies to surface-exposed viral glycoproteins can lead to protective responses that ultimately control and prevent future infections. Targeting functionally conserved epitopes may help reduce the likelihood of viral escape and aid in preventing the spread of related viruses with pandemic potential. One such functionally conserved viral epitope is the site to which a receptor must bind to facilitate viral entry. Here, we leveraged rational immunogen design strategies to focus humoral responses to the receptor binding motif (RBM) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Using glycan engineering and epitope scaffolding, we find an improved targeting of the serum response to the RBM in context of SARS-CoV-2 spike imprinting. Furthermore, we observed a robust SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing serum response with increased potency against related sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV and WIV1-CoV. Thus, RBM focusing is a promising strategy to elicit breadth across emerging sarbecoviruses and represents an adaptable design approach for targeting conserved epitopes on other viral glycoproteins.

210,Shed the light on virus: virucidal effects of 405 nm visible light on SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.,"Germicidal potential of specific wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum is an area of growing interest. While ultra-violet (UV) based technologies have shown satisfactory virucidal potential, the photo-toxicity in humans coupled with UV associated polymer degradation limit its use in occupied spaces. Alternatively, longer wavelengths with less irradiation energy such as visible light (405 nm) have largely been explored in the context of bactericidal and fungicidal applications. Such studies indicated that 405 nm mediated inactivation is caused by the absorbance of porphyrins within the organism creating reactive oxygen species which result in free radical damage to its DNA and disruption of cellular functions. The virucidal potential of visible-light based technologies has been largely unexplored and speculated to be not effective given the lack of porphyrins in viruses. The current study demonstrated increased susceptibility of lipid-enveloped respiratory pathogens of importance such as SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) as well as the influenza A virus to 405nm, visible light in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers, indicating a potential porphyrin-independent alternative mechanism of visible light mediated viral inactivation. Given that visible light is generally safe to humans, our results support further exploration of the use of visible light technology for the application of continuous decontamination in areas within hospitals and/or infectious disease laboratories, specifically for the inactivation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A.",Clifford J Yahnke; Raveen J Rathnasinghe; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435337,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435337,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
211,Impact of School Reopening on Pandemic Spread: A Case Study using an Agent-Based Model for COVID-19,"This article examines the impact of partial/full reopening of school/college campuses on the spread of a pandemic using COVID-19 as a case study. The study uses an agent-based simulation model that replicates community spread in an urban region of U.S.A. via daily social mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the models behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15 %) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.",Hanisha Anand Tatapudi; Tapas K Das,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253485,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253485,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,True
212,The local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults,"While a substantial proportion of adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 progress to develop severe disease, children rarely manifest respiratory complications. Therefore, understanding differences in the local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults may provide important clues about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we first generated a healthy reference multi-omics single cell data set from children (n=30) in whom we have profiled triple matched samples: nasal and tracheal brushings and PBMCs, where we track the developmental changes for 42 airway and 31 blood cell populations from infancy, through childhood to adolescence. This has revealed the presence of naive B and T lymphocytes in neonates and infants with a unique gene expression signature bearing hallmarks of innate immunity. We then contrast the healthy reference with equivalent data from severe paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients (total n=27), from the same three types of samples: upper and lower airways and blood. We found striking differences: children with COVID-19 as opposed to adults had a higher proportion of innate lymphoid and non-clonally expanded naive T cells in peripheral blood, and a limited interferon-response signature. In the airway epithelium, we found the highest viral load in goblet and ciliated cells and describe a novel inflammatory epithelial cell population. These cells represent a transitional regenerative state between secretory and ciliated cells; they were found in healthy children and were enriched in paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients. Epithelial cells display an antiviral and neutrophil-recruiting gene signature that is weaker in severe paediatric versus adult COVID-19. Our matched blood and airway samples allowed us to study the spatial dynamics of infection. Lastly, we provide a user-friendly interface for this data1 as a highly granular reference for the study of immune responses in airways and blood in children.",Masahiro Yoshida; Kaylee B Worlock; Ni Huang; Rik GH Lindeboom; Colin R Butler; Natsuhiko Kumasaka; Cecilia Dominguez Conde; Lira Mamanova; Liam Bolt; Laura Richardson; Krzysztof Polanski; Elo Madissoon; Josephine L Barnes; Jessica Allen-Hyttinen; Eliz Kilich; Brendan C Jones; Angus de Wilton; Anna Wilbrey-Clark; Waradon Sungnak; Jan Patrick Prett; Elena Prigmore; Henry Yung; Puja Mehta; Aarash Saleh; Anita Saigal; Vivian Chu; Jonathan M Cohen; Clare Cane; Aikaterini Iordanidou; Soichi Shibuya; Ann-Kathrin Reuschl; A.

213,Monitoring the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Tenerife (Spain) since mid-December 2020,"Starting in December 2020, a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases occurred in Tenerife compared to the rest of the Canary Islands (Spain). Because of the direct touristic connections between Tenerife and the UK, and the rapid transmission and dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC-202012/01) by the end of November 2020 in South England, here we measured the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases occurring between the 18th of December 2020 and the 25th of February 2021. Out of the 2,091 COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples assessed, 226 showed a spike gene target failure (SGTF). Subsequent viral genome sequencing further confirmed that 93.2% of them corresponded to the B.1.1.7 lineage. Furthermore, a rapid increase in the proportion of SGTF variants was detected in up to 10.7% of positive cases during the Christmas season despite stricter measures for containing the transmission were imposed in Tenerife in the period. These results support the local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in Tenerife since late December 2020 although it is not yet dominant.",Julia Alcoba-Florez; Jose M.

214,Persisting Salivary IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at 9 Months After Mild COVID-19: A Complementary Approach to Population Surveys,"BackgroundDeclining humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients and possibility of reinfections has raised concern. Mucosal immunity particularly salivary antibodies could be short-lived. However, long-term studies are sparse.

MethodsUsing a multiplex bead-based array platform, we investigated antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in 256 saliva samples from convalescent patients 1-9 months after symptomatic COVID-19 (n=74, Cohort 1), undiagnosed individuals with self-reported questionnaires (n=147, Cohort 2), and individuals sampled pre-pandemic time (n= 35, Cohort 3).

ResultsSalivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to 9 month recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At 9 months, IgG remained in saliva in majority as seen in blood serology. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments.

ConclusionsUnlike SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA that appeared short-lived, the specific IgG in saliva appears stable even after mild COVID-19 as noted for blood serology. The non-invasive saliva-based SARS-Cov-2 antibody testing with self-collection at homes may thus serve as a complementary alternative to conventional blood serology.",Hassan Alkharaan; Shaghayegh Bayati; Cecilia Hellstrom; Annika Olsson; Karin Lindahl; Gordana Bogdanovic; Soo Aleman; Georgios Tsilingaridis; Patricia De Palma; Sophia Hober; Anna Manberg; Peter Nilsson; Elisa Pin; Margaret Sallberg Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253492,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253492,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,True
215,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 N-terminal domain dimerizes and harbors autonomously folded elements,"The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein is a critical component of the RNA replicase, as its N-terminal domain (NTD) anchors Nsp12, the RNA, and Nsp13. Whereas its C-terminal domain (CTD) structure is well resolved, there is an open debate regarding the conformation adopted by the NTD as it is predicted as disordered but found in a variety of complex-dependent conformations or missing from many other structures. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the SARS CoV-2 Nsp8 NTD features both well folded secondary structure and disordered segments. Our results suggest that while part of this domain corresponding to two long -helices forms autonomously, the folding of other segments would require interaction with other replicase components. When isolated, the -helix population progressively declines towards the C-termini, and dynamics measurements indicate that the Nsp8 NTD behaves as a dimer under our conditions.",Miguel Á Treviño; David Pantoja-Uceda; Douglas Vinson Laurents; Miguel Mompeán,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435186,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435186,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
216,SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION OF COVID-19 MITIGATION (SOCOM): ASSESSING FACE COVERING AND DISTANCING IN SCHOOLS,"IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall of 2020. Physical distancing and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, no research has focused on mitigation strategy adherence during school days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM).

MethodsWe extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop the SOCOM training and implementation protocol to assess physical distancing and face covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs).

ResultsFor the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with more activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were ideal for accurately capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing (90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level (87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with [&ge;]20 students.

ConclusionsMillions of children throughout the US are likely to return to school in the months ahead despite the current surge of COVID-19 cases. SOCOM is a relatively inexpensive tool that can be implemented by schools to determine mitigation strategy adherence and assess changes to protocols to help students return to school safely and slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be used for research purposes.",Ricky Camplain; Nanette V.

219,HIV service interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: the role of HIV service challenges and institutional response from healthcare professional's perspective,"BackgroundThe healthcare system in China was largely overwhelmed during the unprecedented pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). HIV-related services have been unavoidably interrupted and impacted. However, the nature and scope of HIV service interruptions due to COVID-19 has rarely been characterized in China and how HIV service challenges affect the service interruptions are also unclear. The current study aimed at characterize HIV service interruption levels and analyzed its associated factors related to service challenges and institutional response from HIV healthcare providers viewpoint.

MethodsA cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1,029 HIV healthcare providers in Guangxi, China, from April to May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was first used to identify HIV service interruption levels. Then hierarchical multinomial logistic regression was conducted to analyze the relationships of HIV care service challenges and institutional response with HIV service interruption levels. Simple slope analysis was employed to examine interaction effects between HIV service challenges and institutional response to COVID-19.

ResultsFour classes of HIV service interruption were identified using LCA, with 22.0% complete interruption (class 1), 15.4% moderate interruption (class 2), 21.9% minor interruption (class 3) and 40.7% almost no interruption (class 4). Using class 4 as a reference group, HIV care service challenges were positively associated with the probabilities of service interruptions (Class 1: AOR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.19[~]1.26; Class 2: AOR= 1.10, 95%CI: 1.08[~]1.13; Class 3: AOR= 1.10, 95%CI: 1.08[~]1.12). Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery was negatively associated with the probabilities of being classified into Class 1 (""Complete interruption"") (AOR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.93[~]1.00) and Class 3 (""minor interruption [Outreach service]"") (AOR=0.96, 95%CI: 0.93[~]0.99) as compared to Class 4 (""almost no interruption""). Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery moderated the association of HIV service challenges with complete interruption, but not with the moderate or minor interruption when comparing with no interruption group.

ConclusionsA substantial HIV service interruptions occurs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly services that require face-to-face interactions, such as VCT counselling, follow up and outreach services. HIV service challenges largely hinder the HIV service delivery. Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery could marginally buffer the negative effect of service challenges on complete HIV service interruptions.

221,A novel soluble ACE2 protein totally protects from lethal disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses full-length angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is membrane bound, as its initial cell contact receptor preceding viral entry. Here we report a human soluble ACE2 variant fused with a 5kD albumin binding domain (ABD) and bridged via a dimerization motif hinge-like 4-cysteine dodecapeptide, which we term ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD. This protein is enzymatically active, has increased duration of action in vivo conferred by the ABD-tag, and displays 20-30-fold higher binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain than its des-DDC monomeric form (ACE2 1-618-ABD) due to DDC-linked dimerization. ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD was administered for 3 consecutive days to transgenic k18-hACE2 mice, a model that develops lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection, to evaluate the preclinical preventative/ therapeutic value for COVID-19. Mice treated with ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD developed a mild to moderate disease for the first few days assessed by a clinical score and modest weight loss. The untreated control animals, by contrast, became severely ill and had to be sacrificed by day 6/7 and lung histology revealed extensive pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage and mononuclear infiltrates.

222,A map of direct SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions implicates specific human host processes,"Key steps in viral propagation, immune suppression, and pathology are mediated by direct, binary, physical interactions between viral and host proteins. To understand the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we generated an unbiased systematic map of binary interactions between viral and host proteins, complementing previous co-complex association maps by conveying more direct mechanistic understanding and potentially enabling targeted disruption of direct interactions. To this end, we deployed two parallel strategies, identifying 205 virus-host and 27 intraviral binary interactions amongst 171 host and 19 viral proteins, and confirming high quality of these interactions via a calibrated orthogonal assay. Host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are enriched in various cellular processes, including immune signaling and inflammation, protein ubiquitination, and membrane trafficking.

223,Differential gene expression by RNA-Seq in Sigma-2 Receptor/TMEM97 knockout cells reveals its role in complement activation and SARS-CoV-2 viral uptake,"Our lab has recently shown that the Sigma-2 Receptor/Transmembrane Protein 97 (sigma-2R/TMEM97) interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and facilitates the enhanced uptake of various ligands including lipoproteins and intrinsically disordered proteins. TMEM97 has been recently been shown to interact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins, highlighting its potential involvement with viral entry into the cell. We hypothesized that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may play a role in facilitating viral uptake, and with the regulation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways that are involved with viral infection. In this study, we identified the top differentially expressed genes upon the knockout of sigma-2R/TMEM97, and analyzed the genes involved with the inflammatory and thrombotic cascades, effects that are observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the ablation of sigma-2R/TMEM97 resulted in an increase in Complement Component 4 Binding Protein (C4BP) proteins, at both the translational and transcriptional levels. We also showed that sigma-2R/TMEM97 interacts with the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, forming a protein complex, and that disruption of this complex results in the inhibition of viral uptake. The results of this study suggest that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may be a novel therapeutic target to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral uptake, as well as to decrease inflammatory and thrombotic effects through the modulation of the complement cascade.",Aladdin Riad; Yann Aubert; Chenbo Zeng; Thomas J.

224,"Structure, Mechanism and Crystallographic fragment screening of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase","The global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has infected over 100 million and caused over 2 million fatalities worldwide at the point of writing. There is currently a lack of effective drugs to treat people infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) is a superfamily1B helicase that has been identified as a possible target for anti-viral drugs due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. In this study we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP). Comparisons of these structures reveal details of global and local conformational changes that are induced by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. Structural analysis reveals two pockets on NSP13 that are classified as ""druggable"" and include one of the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. To identify possible starting points for anti-viral drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase. The fragment screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets, with hot spots in pockets predicted to be of functional importance, including the druggable nucleotide and nucleic acid binding sites, opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.",Joseph A Newman; Alice Douangamath; Setayesh Yazdani; Yuliana Yosaatmadja; Anthony Aimon; Jose Brandao-Neto; Louise Dunnett; Tyler Gorrie-Stone; Rachael Skyner; Daren Fearon; Matthieu Schapira; Frank von Delft; Opher Gileadi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435326,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435326,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
225,S-acylation controls SARS-Cov-2 membrane lipid organization and enhances infectivity,"SARS-CoV-2 virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer which contains membrane proteins such as Spike, responsible for target-cell binding and virus fusion, the envelope protein E and the accessory protein Orf3a. Here, we show that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, all three proteins become lipid modified, through action of the S-acyltransferase ZDHHC20. Particularly striking is the rapid acylation of Spike on 10 cytosolic cysteines within the ER and Golgi. Using a combination of computational, lipidomics and biochemical approaches, we show that this massive lipidation controls Spike biogenesis and degradation, and drives the formation of localized ordered cholesterol and sphingolipid rich lipid nanodomains, in the early Golgi where viral budding occurs. ZDHHC20-mediated acylation allows the formation of viruses with enhanced fusion capacity and overall infectivity.

226,One-shot identification of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD escape mutants using yeast screening,"The potential emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) escape mutants is a threat to reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines and neutralizing antibody (nAb) therapies. An understanding of the antibody/S escape mutations landscape is urgently needed to preemptively address this threat. Here we describe a rapid method to identify escape mutants for nAbs targeting the S receptor binding site. We identified escape mutants for five nAbs, including three from the public germline class VH3-53 elicited by natural COVID-19 infection. Escape mutations predominantly mapped to the periphery of the ACE2 recognition site on the RBD with K417, D420, Y421, F486, and Q493 as notable hotspots. We provide libraries, methods, and software as an openly available community resource to accelerate new therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

227,Effects of Mutations in the Receptor-Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike on its Binding Affinity to ACE2 and Neutralizing Antibodies Revealed by Computational Analysis,"SARS-CoV-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the most deleterious pandemics of our time. The interaction between the ACE2 receptors at the surface of human cells and the viral Spike (S) protein triggers the infection making the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein a focal target for the neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Despite the recent progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, the emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to Abs produced in response to the vaccine administration and/or monoclonal ones represents upcoming jeopardy. Here, we assessed the possible effects of single and multiple mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein on its binding energy to various antibodies and the human ACE2 receptor. The performed computational analysis indicates that while single amino acid replacements in RBD may only cause partial impairment of the Abs binding, moreover, limited to specific epitopes, some variants of SARS-CoV-2 (with as few as 8 mutations), which are already present in the population, may potentially result in a much broader antigenic escape. We also identified a number of point mutations, which, in contrast to the majority of replacements, reduce RBD affinity to various antibodies without affecting its binding to ACE2. Overall, the results provide guidelines for further experimental studies aiming at the identification of the high-risk RBD mutations allowing for an antigenic escape.",Marine E Bozdaganyan; Olga S Sokolova; Konstantin V Shaitan; Mikhail P Kirpichnikov; Philipp S Orekhov,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435322,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435322,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
228,BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine induces antibodies of broader cross-reactivity than natural infection but recognition of mutant viruses is up to 10-fold reduced,"BackgroundSeveral new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged since fall 2020 which have multiple mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein.

ObjectiveWe aimed to assess how mutations in RBD affected recognition of immune sera by antibodies induced by natural infection versus immunization with BNT162b2, a mRNA-based vaccine against COVID-19.

MethodsWe produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants with single mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region (E484K, K417N, N501Y) or with all 3 mutations combined, as occurring in the newly emerged variants B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Using standard and avidity ELISAs, we determined the binding capacities to mutant RBDs of antibodies induced by infection versus vaccination.

ResultsThese binding assays showed that vaccination induced antibodies recognize both wildtype and mutant RBDs with higher avidities than those raised by infection. Nevertheless, recognition of mutants RBDK417N and RBDN501Y was 2.5-3-fold reduced while RBDE484K and the triple mutant were 10-fold less well recognized, demonstrating that the mutation at position 484 was key for the observed loss in cross-reactivity.

ConclusionOur binding data demonstrate improved recognition of mutant viruses by BNT162b2-induced antibodies compared to those induced by natural infection. Recognition may, however, be 10-fold reduced for the variants B.1.351/P.1, suggesting that the development of a new vaccine is warranted. The E484K mutation is an key hurdle for immune recognition, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy as well as serological assays based on the wildtype sequence may therefore seriously impaired.

229,Antibody evasion by the Brazilian P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2,"Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K, K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2 binding site mutations, we explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.",Wanwisa - Dejnirattisai; Daming - Zhou; Piyada - Supasa; Chang - Liu; Alexander J.

230,Structural basis for backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex,"Backtracking, the reverse motion of the transcriptase enzyme on the nucleic acid template, is a universal regulatory feature of transcription in cellular organisms but its role in viruses is not established. Here we present evidence that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein crosslinking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3-segment of the product-RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product-RNA 3-end frays and enters the NTP-entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking. Backtracking may aid proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against antivirals.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated and transcribed by its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the target for antivirals such as remdesivir. We use a combination of approaches to show that backtracking (backwards motion of the RdRp on the template RNA) is a feature of SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription. Backtracking may play a critical role in proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against many antivirals.",Brandon Malone; James Chen; Qi Wang; Eiiza Llewellyn; Young Joo Choi; Paul Dominic B.

231,Clomipramine suppresses ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry,"Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells are initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection. Here, we found that clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and metabolic disorder in human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Among 13 approved drugs that we have previously identified as potential inhibitor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, clomipramine showed the best potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-stimulated ACE2 internalization. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection to human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) and TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells were dramatically suppressed even after treatment with clomipramine. Furthermore, the combined use of clomipramine and remdesivir was revealed to synergistically suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.

232,"A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of convalescent plasma in adults with severe COVID-19","BackgroundAlthough convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), data from randomized controlled trials that support its efficacy are limited.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19.

DesignRandomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted from April 21st to November 27th, 2020.

SettingFive hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

ParticipantsHospitalized patients aged [&ge;]18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, infiltrates on chest imaging and oxygen saturation [&le;] 94% on room air or requirement for supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

InterventionParticipants were randomized 2:1 to a single transfusion of either 1 unit of convalescent or normal control plasma.

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.

ResultsOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in clinical status was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (with an odds ratio (OR) of a 1-point improvement in the scale: 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.68, p=0.180).

However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples (n=40) from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected. Serious adverse events occurred in 39/147 (27%) participants who received convalescent plasma and 26/72 (36%) participants who received control plasma.

LimitationsSome participants did not receive high-titer convalescent plasma.

ConclusionIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in 28 days clinical status. The significant reduction in mortality associated with convalescent plasma, however, may warrant further evaluation.

233,"COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Hesitancy in Low and Middle Income Countries, and Implications for Messaging","BackgroundAs vaccination campaigns are deployed worldwide, addressing vaccine hesitancy is of critical importance to ensure sufficient immunization coverage. We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 samples covering ten low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America, and two higher income countries (Russia and the United States).

MethodsStandardized survey responses were collected from  45,928 individuals between June 2020 and January 2021. We estimate vaccine acceptance with robust standard errors clustered at the study level. We analyze stated reasons for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, and the most trusted sources for advice on vaccination, and we disaggregate acceptance rates by gender, age, and education level.

FindingsWe document willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, ranging from 67% (Burkina Faso) to 97% (Nepal). Willingness was considerably higher in LMICs (80%) than in the United States (65%) and Russia (30%). Vaccine acceptance was primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against the disease (91%). Concern about side effects (40%) was the most common reason for reluctance. Health workers were considered the most trusted sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines.

InterpretationGiven high levels of stated willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, our study suggests that prioritizing efficient and equitable vaccine distribution to LMICs will yield high returns in promoting immunization on a global scale. Messaging and other community-level interventions in these contexts should be designed to help translate intentions into uptake, and emphasize safety and efficacy. Trusted health workers are ideally positioned to deliver these messages.

It has appeared to intensify during the COVID-19 pandemic and the nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as closures, taken to slow its spread. No-shows interfere with patients continuous care, lead to inefficient utilization of medical resources, and increase healthcare costs. We present a comprehensive analysis of no-shows for breast imaging appointments made during 2020 in a large medical network in Israel. We applied advanced machine learning methods to provide insights into novel and known predictors. Additionally, we employed causal inference methodology to infer the effect of closures on no-shows, after accounting for confounding biases, and demonstrate the superiority of adversarial balancing over inverse probability weighting in correcting these biases.

METHODSFrom April 21 to December 31, 2020, we assembled a cohort of consecutive volunteers who a) had documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positivity; b) were [&ge;] 2 weeks past onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first test for SARS-CoV-2; and c) were able to travel to our site in San Francisco. Participants learned about the study by being identified on medical center-based registries and being notified or by responding to advertisements. At 4-month intervals, we asked participants about physical symptoms that were new or worse compared to the period prior to COVID-19, mental health symptoms and quality of life. We described 4 time periods: 1) acute illness (0-3 weeks), 2) early recovery (3-10 weeks), 3) late recovery 1 (12-20 weeks), and 4) late recovery 2 (28-36 weeks). Blood and oral specimens were collected at each visit.

RESULTSWe have, to date, enrolled 179 adults. During acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 had been asymptomatic, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. In the acute phase, the most common symptoms were fatigue, fever, myalgia, cough and anosmia/dysgeusia. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were the most commonly reported symptoms, but a variety of others were endorsed by at least some participants. Some experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with ambulation and performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale value rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months (80, interquartile range [IQR]: 70-90; and 80, IQR 75-90) compared to prior to COVID-19 (85; IQR 75-90). Biospecimens were collected at nearly 600 participant-visits.

CONCLUSIONAmong a cohort of participants enrolled in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found many with persistent physical symptoms through 8 months following onset of COVID-19 with an impact on self-rated overall health. The presence of participants with and without symptoms and ample biological specimens will facilitate study of PASC pathogenesis.

236,New SARS-CoV-2 lineages could evade CD8+ T-cells response,"Background: Many SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have emerged since the Covid-19 outburst, notably the lineages detected in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However, not enough attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of infection by new lineages. Methods: In this work, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and the potential of associated mutations to trigger or hinder CD8+ T-cells response. We also estimated the population's coverage of these different lineages, considering peptide binding predictions to class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages. Results: We observed a lower populational coverage for 20B/S.484K (P.2 lineage) in contrast to an increased coverage found for 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 Lineage) and 20J/501Y.V3 (P.1 lineage) compared to a reference lineage. Moreover, mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid T205I were predicted to have an overall higher affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence. Conclusions: In summary, the data in this work provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also highlights the reduced populational's coverage for the Brazilian lineage P.2, suggesting its potential to evade from CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results also may guide efforts to characterize and validate relevant peptides to trigger CD8+ T-cell responses, and design new universal T-cell-inducing vaccine candidates that minimize detrimental effects of viral diversification and at the same time induce responses to a broad human population.",Marco Antonio Marques Pretti; Romulo Goncalves Galvani; Alessandro S Farias; Mariana Boroni,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434584,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434584,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,False
237,All Models Are Useful: Bayesian Ensembling for Robust High Resolution COVID-19 Forecasting,"Timely, high-resolution forecasts of infectious disease incidence are useful for policy makers in deciding intervention measures and estimating healthcare resource burden. In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our models performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections. Our work demonstrates that such a real-time high resolution forecasting pipeline can be developed by integrating multiple methods within a performance-based ensemble to support pandemic response.

238,Modeling the use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to safely relax non-pharmaceutical interventions,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, mask wearing, and enhanced hygiene, have been implemented. As of March 2021, three effective vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the United States, with several other vaccines in the pipeline. We use a transmission model to study when and how NPIs could be relaxed in the United States with relative safety as vaccination becomes more widespread. We compare different relaxation scenarios where NPIs begin to relax 0-9 months after vaccination begins for both a one dose and two dose strategy, with historical levels of social interactions being reached within 1 month to 1 year. In our model, vaccination can allow widespread relaxation of NPIs to begin safely within 2 to 9 months, greatly reducing deaths and peak health system burden compared to relaxing NPIs without vaccination. Vaccinated individuals can safely begin to relax NPIs sooner than unvaccinated individuals. The extent of delay needed to safely reopen depends primarily on the rate of vaccine rollout, with the degree of protection against asymptomatic infection playing a secondary role. If a vaccination rate of 3 million doses/day can be achieved, similar to the typical rollout speed of seasonal influenza vaccination, NPIs could begin to be safely relaxed in 2-3 months. With a vaccination rate of 1 million doses/day, a 6-9-month delay is needed. A one dose strategy is preferred if relative efficacy is similar to a two-dose series, but the relative benefit of this strategy is minimal when vaccine rollout is fast. Due to the urgent need to pursue strategies that enable safe relaxation of NPIs, we recommend a two-dose strategy with an initial delay of at least 3 months in relaxing restrictions further, and that the speed of vaccine rollout be given immediate priority.",Alicia N M Kraay; Molly E.

239,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundAlthough the number of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases continues to increase globally, there are few studies on the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo conduct a comprehensive systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents to better guide the response to the current epidemic.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI (Chinese database), Clinical Trials.gov and chictr.org.cn (China). The methodological quality of the included literature was evaluated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14.0. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified using I2. We used fixed-effects or random-effects models to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated by the Beggs test.

ResultsWe analyzed 49 studies involving 1627 patients. In the pooled data, the most common clinical symptoms were fever (56% [0.50-0.61]) and cough (45% [0.39-0.51]). The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated procalcitonin (40% [0.23-0.57]), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (31% [0.19-0.43]), increased lymphocyte count (28% [0.17-0.42]), increased creatine kinase (28% [0.18- 0.40]), and elevated C-reactive protein (26% [0.17-0.36]). The most common abnormalities determined by computed tomography were lower-lobe involvement (56% [0.42-0.70]), ground-glass opacities (33% [0.25-0.42]), bilateral pneumonia (32% [0.24-0.40]), patchy shadowing (31% [0.18-0.45]), and upper lobe involvement (30% [0.20-0.41]).

240,Rapid review of social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundPhysical distancing measures aim to reduce person-to-person contact, a key driver of transmission of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review aims to synthesize empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodWe conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures.

ResultsWe identified 12 studies that reported social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of studies (11/12) collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns and the most stringent physical distancing measures. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2-5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates which ranged from 7-26 contacts per day in similar settings. This reduction was particularly pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates subsequently increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults.

ConclusionInformation on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",Carol Y.

241,The efficacy and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe global total of COVID-19 cases will reach 20 million this week, with 750,000 deaths. It has spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world. At present, the global pandemic continues to rise and continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to explore the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19 as soon as possible. Remdesiviras was an antiviral agent with therapeutic potential, but it was still controversial.

ObjectiveThrough systematic review and meta-analysis, to evaluate the effect and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and will provide a reliable reference for the treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsWe used the following search string: ""COVID-19"" [Mesh], ""remdesivir"" [Mesh], ""randomized controlled trial"" [Mesh]. We used the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and corresponding keywords to make the search strategy. We searched six databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trials.gov and chictr.org.cn. Data analyses were conducted by using the software Review Manager 5.3 and STATA version 14.0.

ResultsOur systematic search identified 5 meta-analyses of RCTs, including 1782 patients with COVID-19.The clinical improvement of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 was superior to the placebo-controlled group (relative risk (RR) =1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.29, p=0.0009). The following are the Single-Arm Study, Meta-analysis results. The pooled prevalence of clinical improvement significant findings was 62% (95% CI = 59-65%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir. The incidence rates of Acute kidney injury, Hepatic enzyme increased, Any serious adverse event were 5% (95%CI=3-7%, p=0.00), 11%(95%CI=5-16%, p=0.00), 22%(95%CI=18-27%, p=0.00), respectively, and the mortality was 13%(95%CI=8-19%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir.

ConclusionThis analysis confirms that remdesivir is effective in the clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients, and the rate of clinical improvement was 62%.

242,Engagement with daily testing instead of self-isolating in contacts of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2.,"BackgroundIn December 2020, Public Health England with NHS Test and Trace initiated a pilot study in which close contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19 were given the option to carryout lateral flow device antigen tests at home, as an alternative to self-isolation for 10-14 days. In this study, we evaluated acceptability of and engagement with daily testing, and assessed levels of adherence to the rules relating to behaviour following positive or negative test results.

MethodsWe conducted a service evaluation of a pilot study, involving an online cross-sectional survey offered to adult (> 18 years) contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases who were invited to participate in seven days of daily testing instead of isolation. We used a comparison group of contacts who were not offered testing and performed self-isolation. Herein, we examine survey responses from a subset of those who took part in the pilot study and who responded to the evaluation questionnaire.

ResultsAcceptability of daily testing was lower among survey respondents who were not offered the option of having it and among people from ethnic minority groups. Overall, 52% of respondents reported being more likely to share details of people that they had been in contact with following a positive test result, if they knew that their contacts would be offered the option of daily testing. Only 2% reported that they would be less likely to provide details of their contacts. On the days that they were trying to self-isolate, 19% of participants reported that they left the house, with no significant demographic group differences. Following a negative test, 13% of respondents reported that they increased their contacts, but most (58%) reported having fewer risky contacts.

ConclusionsOur data suggest that daily testing is potentially acceptable, and may facilitate sharing contact details of close contacts among those who test positive for COVID-19, and promote adherence to self-isolation. A better understanding is needed of how to make this option more acceptable for all households. The impact of receiving a negative test on behaviour remains a risk that needs to be monitored and mitigated by appropriate messaging. Future research should examine attitudes and behaviour in a context where infection levels are lower, testing is more familiar, much of the population has been vaccinated and restrictions on activity have been reduced.",Alex F Martin; Sarah Denford; Nicola Love; Derren Ready; Isabel Oliver; Richard Amlot; G.

243,"The causal effect of serum vitamin D concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits: a Mendelian randomization study","BackgroundEvidence supporting the role of vitamin D in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains controversial.

MethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to analyze the causal effect of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits by using summary-level GWAS data. The causal associations were estimated with inverse variance weighted (IVW) with fixed effects (IVW-fixed) and random effects (IVW-random), MR-Egger, weighted median and MR Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR.RAPS) methods. We further applied the MR Steiger filtering method, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test and PhenoScanner tool to check and remove single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were horizontally pleiotropic.

ResultsWe found no evidence to support the causal associations between the serum 25(OH)D concentration and the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility (IVW-fixed: odds ratio [OR] = 0.9049, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8197[~]0.9988, p = 0.0473), severity (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0298, 95% CI 0.7699[~]1.3775, p = 0.8432) and hospitalized traits (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0713, 95% CI 0.8819[~]1.3013, p = 0.4878) using outlier removed sets at a Bonferroni-corrected p threshold of 0.0167. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal any sign of horizontal pleiotropy.

ConclusionsOur MR analysis provided precise evidence that genetically lowered serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not causally associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity or hospitalized traits. Our study therefore did not provide evidence assessing the role of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to explore and define the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",Zhiyong Cui; Yun Tian,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252901,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252901,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
244,A potential SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest (VOI) harboring mutation E484K in the Spike protein was identified within lineage B.1.1.33 circulating in Brazil,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil was dominated by two lineages designated as B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33. Two SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the Spike (S) protein, designated as lineages P.1 and P.2, evolved within lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a Variant of Concern (VOC) because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein (including K417T, E484K, N501Y), while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a Variant of Interest (VOI). Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021. This VOI displayed four non-synonymous lineage-defining mutations (NSP3:A1711V, NSP6:F36L, S:E484K, and NS7b:E33A) and was designated as lineage N.9.

245,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and viral RNA on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and investigating contamination concentration,"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces. Many studies have used RT-PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered, and whether virus viability is concentration dependant.

Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 124 and 113 hours respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 hours. Viability on cotton was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 72 hours. RNA on all the surfaces exhibited a one log reduction in genome copy recovery over 21 days.

The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on non-porous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces with only one log reduction in recovery over three weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within two days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces it does not directly indicate presence of viable virus even at high CT values.

ImportanceThis study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface. Unless sampled immediately after contamination it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.",Susan Elizabeth Paton; Antony Spencer; Isobel Garratt; Katy-Anne Thompson; Ikshitaa Dinesh; Paz AranegaBou; David Stevenson; Simon O Clark; Jake Dunning; Allan M Bennett; Thomas Pottage,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.435056,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.435056,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,False

Multiple metrics have been considered to evaluate the spread, infection, and mortality of infectious diseases. For example, numbers of new cases and deaths provide measures of absolute impact within a given population and time frame, while the effective reproduction rate provides a measure of the rate of spread. It is critical to evaluate multiple metrics concurrently, as they provide complementary insights into the impact and current state of the pandemic. We describe a unified framework for estimating and quantifying the uncertainty in the smoothed daily effective reproduction number, case rate, and death rate in a region using log-linear models. We apply this framework to characterize COVID-19 impact at multiple geographic resolutions, including by US county and state as well as by country, demonstrating the variation across resolutions and the need for harmonized efforts to control the pandemic.

247,COVID-19 Risk Factors and Mortality among Native Americans,"BACKGROUNDAcademic research on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 among Native Americans has largely been restricted to particular indigenous groups or reservations.

OBJECTIVEWe estimate COVID-19 mortality for Native Americans relative to other racial/ethnic groups and explore how state-level mortality is associated with known risk factors. METHODS: We use the Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR), adjusted for age and county, to estimate COVID-19 mortality by racial/ethnic groups for the U.S. and 10 selected states. The prevalence of risk factors is derived from the American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

RESULTSThe SMR for Native Americans greatly exceeds those for Black and Latino populations and varies enormously across states. There is a strong correlation between the share of Native Americans living on a reservation and the SMR. The SMR for Native Americans is also highly correlated with the income-poverty ratio and the prevalence of multigenerational families, crowded housing, frontline worker status, and health insurance (excluding the Indian Health Service). Risk factors associated with socioeconomic status and co-morbidities are generally more prevalent for Native Americans living on homelands, a proxy for reservation status, than for those living elsewhere.

CONCLUSIONSMost risk factors for COVID-19 are disproportionately high among Native Americans, particularly for those living on homelands. Reservation life appears to increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality.

248,Limits of lockdown: characterising essential contacts during strict physical distancing,"COVID-19 has exposed health inequalities within countries and globally. The fundamental determining factor behind an individuals risk of infection is the number of social contacts they make. In many countries, physical distancing measures have been implemented to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2, reducing social contacts to a minimum. Characterising unavoidable social contacts is key for understanding the inequalities behind differential risks and planning vaccination programmes. We utilised an existing English longitudinal birth cohort, which is broadly representative of the wider population (n=6807), to explore social contact patterns and behaviours when strict physical distancing measures were in place during the UKs first lockdown in March-May 2020. Essential workers, specifically those in healthcare, had 4.5 times as many contacts as non-essential workers [incident rate ratio = 4.42 (CI95%: 3.88-5.04)], whilst essential workers in other sectors, mainly teaching and the police force had three times as many contacts [IRR = 2.84 (2.58-3.13)]. The number of individuals in a household, which is conflated by number of children, increases essential social contacts by 40%. Self-isolation effectively reduces numbers of contacts outside of the home, but not entirely. Together, these findings will aid the interpretation of epidemiological data and impact the design of effective SARS-CoV-2 control strategies, such as vaccination, testing and contact tracing.",Amy C Thomas; Leon Danon; Hannah Christensen; Kate Northstone; Daniel Smith; Emily J Nixon; Adam Trickey; Gibran Hemani; Sarah Sauchelli; Adam Finn; Nicholas J Timpson; Ellen Brooks-Pollock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253484,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253484,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True

MethodsWe recruited 684 HCWs from Kilifi (rural), Busia (rural) and Nairobi (urban) counties. The serosurvey was conducted between 30th July 2020 and 4th December 2020. We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. We adjusted prevalence estimates using Bayesian modeling to account for assay performance.

ResultsCrude overall seroprevalence was 19.7% (135/684). After adjustment for assay performance seroprevalence was 20.8% (95% CI 17.5-24.4%). Seroprevalence varied significantly (p<0.001) by site: 43.8% (CI 35.8-52.2%) in Nairobi, 12.6% (CI 8.8-17.1%) in Busia and 11.5% (CI 7.2-17.6%) in Kilifi. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex and site, professional cadre was not associated with differences in seroprevalence.

We tested the hypothesis that the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests varied by time of day, suggesting variation in viral shedding by time of day. Among 30,000 clinical tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the Vanderbilt Affiliated Healthcare Network from March-June 2020, we found evidence for diurnal variation in the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, with a peak around 2pm in the afternoon and 2-fold variation over the day. Variation was most pronounced in outpatient and inpatient testing locations. These findings have important implications for public health testing and vaccination strategies.",Candace D.

251,Is there a serum proteome signature to predict mortality in severe COVID-19 patients?,"Here we recorded serum proteome profiles of 33 COVID-19 patients admitted to respiratory and intensive care units because of respiratory failure. We received, for most patients, blood samples just after admission and at two more later timepoints. We focused on serum proteins different in abundance between the group of survivors and non-survivors and observed that a rather small panel of about a dozen proteins were significantly different in abundance between these two groups. The four structurally and functionally related type-3 cystatins AHSG, FETUB, HRG and KNG1 were all more abundant in the survivors. The family of inter--trypsin inhibitors, ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3 and ITIH4, were all found to be differentially abundant in between survivors and non-survivors, whereby ITIH1 and ITIH2 were more abundant in the survivor group and ITIH3 and ITIH4 more abundant in the non-survivors. ITIH1/ITIH2 and ITIH3/ITIH4 also did show opposite trends in protein abundance during disease progression. This panel of eight proteins, complemented with a few more, may represent a panel for mortality risk assessment and eventually even for treatment, by administration of exogenous proteins possibly aiding survival. Such administration is not unprecedented, as administration of exogenous inter--trypsin inhibitors is already used in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis and Kawasaki disease. The mortality risk panel defined here is in excellent agreement with findings in two recent COVID-19 serum proteomics studies on independent cohorts, supporting our findings. This panel may not be unique for COVID-19, as some of the proteins here annotated as mortality risk factors have previously been annotated as mortality markers in aging and in other diseases caused by different pathogens, including bacteria.",Franziska Voellmy; Henk van den Toorn; Riccardo Zenezini Chiozzi; Ottavio Zucchetti; Albetto Papi; Carlo Alberto Volta; Luisa Marracino; Francesco Vieceli Dalla Sega; Francecsca Fortini; Gianluca Campo; Marco Contoli; Savino Spadaro; Paola Rizzo; Albert J.R.

252,Awake prone position in adult nonintubated patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19:A multi-centre feasibility randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundThe primary manifestation of Corona Virus Disease -2019 (COVID-19) is acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prone position has been shown to improve outcomes in ventilated patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The feasibility and safety of awake prone positioning and its impact on outcomes if any, in non-intubated patients with mild to moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 is unknown. Results of the observational studies published thus far in this pandemic have been conflicting. In this context, we conducted a multi-centre, parallel group, randomised controlled feasibility study on awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.

Methods60 patients diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID -19 pneumonia requiring 4 or more litres of oxygen to maintain a saturation of [&ge;] 92% were recruited in this study. Thirty patients each were randomised to either standard care or awake prone group. Patients randomised to the standard care were allowed to change their position as per comfort and patients randomized to the prone group were encouraged to self-prone for at least 6 hours a day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adhering to the protocol in each group. Secondary outcomes include failure of therapy leading to escalation of respiratory support, number of hours prone, maximum hours of continuous prone positioning in a day, length of stay in ICU, ICU mortality, total number of patients needing intubation and adverse events.

ResultsIn the prone group, 43% (13 out of 30) of patients were able to self-prone for 6 or more hours a day. The median maximum prone duration per session was 2 hours. In the supine group, 47% (14 out of 30) were completely supine and 53% spent some hours in the prone position, but none exceeded 6 hours. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes between the two groups and there were no adverse events.

InterpretationAwake proning in non-intubated patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure is feasible and safe under clinical trial conditions. The results of our feasibility study will potentially help in the design of larger definitive trials to address this key knowledge gap.",Devachandran Jayakumar; Pratheema Ramachandran; Ebenezer Rabindrarajan; Bharathkumar Tirupakuzhi Vijayaraghavan; Ramakrishnan Nagarajan; Ramesh Venkataraman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253499,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253499,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
253,Serum Vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 severity markers and mortality independent of visceral adiposity,"INTRODUCTIONCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and 25-OHD levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined.

METHODSConsecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation (including outcomes), laboratory measurements (including 25-OHD) and a thoracic computerized tomography (including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness). Low vitamin D was defined as levels <20ng/mL (<50nmol/L) and severely low (or deficient) 25-OHD as a level [&le;]12ng/mL (<30nmol/L)

RESULTSOf the 551 patients included, low 25-OHD levels were present in 45.6% and severely low levels in 10.9%. Severely low 25-OHD levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95%CI 1.24-3.58, p=0.006) but not with critical COVID-19 (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.94-0.99, p=0.042), adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat. Using model-based causal mediation analyses the increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by 25-OHD levels was partly mediated by its effect on D-dimer and cardiac ultrasensitive troponins. Notably, increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was independent of BMI and epicardial fat.

CONCLUSIONVitamin D deficiency ([&le;]12ng/mL or <30nmol/L), is independently associated with COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for visceral fat (epicardial fat thickness). Low 25-OHD may contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, increasing the risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.",Pablo Esteban Vanegas-Cedillo; Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla; Natalia Ramírez-Pedraza; Bethsabel Rodríguez-Encinas; Carolina Isabel Pérez-Carrión; María Isabel Jasso-Ávila; Jorge Valladares-Garcia; Diana Hernández-Juárez; Arsenio Vargas-Vázquez; Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa; Monica Chapa-Ibarguengoitia; Alfredo Ponce de Leon; Jose Sifuentes-Osornio; Carlos A Aguilar-Salinas; Roopa Mehta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253490,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253490,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
254,Interventions to control nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study,"Background: Emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants requires more efficient control measures to limit nosocomial transmission and maintain healthcare capacities during pandemic waves. The relative importance of different strategies is unknown. Methods: We developed an agent-based model and compared the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE), screening of healthcare workers (HCWs), contact tracing of symptomatic HCWs, and HCW cohorting on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model was fit on hospital data, assuming 90% effective PPE use in COVID-19 wards. Intervention effects on the effective reproduction number (R), HCW absenteeism and the proportion of infected individuals among tested individuals (positivity rate) were estimated for a more transmissible variant. Findings: Introduction of a variant with 56% higher transmissibility increased - all other variables kept constant - R from 0.4 to 0.65 (+63%) and nosocomial transmissions by 303%, mainly because of more transmissions caused by pre-symptomatic patients and HCWs. Compared to baseline, PPE use in all hospital wards (assuming 90% effectiveness) reduced R by 85% and absenteeism by 57%. Screening HCWs every three days with perfect test sensitivity reduced R by 67%, yielding a maximum test positivity rate of 5%. Screening HCWs every three or seven days assuming time-varying test sensitivities reduced R by 9% and 3%, respectively. Contact tracing reduced R by at least 32% and achieved higher test positivity rates than screening interventions. HCW cohorting reduced R by 5%. Interpretation: PPE use in all hospital wards and regular screening of HCWs seem most effective in preventing nosocomial transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmissibility.",Thi Mui Pham; Hannan Tahir; Janneke HHM van de Wijgert; Bastiaan Van der Roest; Pauline Ellerbroek; Marc JM Bonten; Martin CJ Bootsma; Mirjam E Kretzschmar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252327,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252327,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
255,Age-dependent impact of the major common genetic risk factor for COVID-19 on severity and mortality,"BackgroundThere is considerable variability in COVID-19 outcomes amongst younger adults--and some of this variation may be due to genetic predisposition. We characterized the clinical implications of the major genetic risk factor for COVID-19 severity, and its age-dependent effect, using individual-level data in a large international multi-centre consortium.

MethodThe major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is a chromosome 3 locus, tagged by the marker rs10490770. We combined individual level data for 13,424 COVID-19 positive patients (N=6,689 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in nine countries to assess the association of this genetic marker with mortality, COVID-19-related complications and laboratory values. We next examined if the magnitude of these associations varied by age and were independent from known clinical COVID-19 risk factors.

FindingsWe found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1{middle dot}4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1{middle dot}2-1{middle dot}6) and COVID-19 related mortality (HR 1{middle dot}5, 95%CI 1{middle dot}3-1{middle dot}8). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] 2{middle dot}0, 95%CI 1{middle dot}6-2{middle dot}6), venous thromboembolism (OR 1{middle dot}7, 95%CI 1{middle dot}2-2{middle dot}4), and hepatic injury (OR 1{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}2-2{middle dot}0). Risk allele carriers [&le;] 60 years had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR 2{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}8-3{middle dot}9) compared to those > 60 years OR 1{middle dot}5 (95%CI 1{middle dot}3-1{middle dot}9, interaction p-value=0{middle dot}04). Amongst individuals [&le;] 60 years who died or experienced severe respiratory COVID-19 outcome, we found that 31{middle dot}8% (95%CI 27{middle dot}6-36{middle dot}2) were risk variant carriers, compared to 13{middle dot}9% (95%CI 12{middle dot}6-15{middle dot}2%) of those not experiencing these outcomes. Prediction of death or severe respiratory failure among those [&le;] 60 years improved when including the risk allele (AUC 0{middle dot}82 vs 0{middle dot}84, p=0{middle dot}016) and the prediction ability of rs10490770 risk allele was similar to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors.

InterpretationThe major common COVID-19 risk locus on chromosome 3 is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality--and these are more pronounced amongst individuals [&le;] 60 years. The effect on COVID-19 severity was similar to, or larger than most established risk factors, suggesting potential implications for clinical risk management.

256,"Mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil, February 2020 to February 2021: insights and limitations from uneven sequencing efforts","The COVID-19 pandemic has already reached approximately 110 million people and it is associated with 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Brazil is the third worst-hit country, with approximately 10.2 million cases and 250 thousand deaths. Unprecedented international efforts have been established in order to share information about epidemiology, viral evolution and transmission dynamics. However, sequencing facilities and research investments are very heterogeneous across different regions and countries across the globe. The understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology is a vital part for the development of effective strategies for public health care and disease management. This work aims to analyze the available genomes sequenced in Brazil between February 2020 and February 2021, in order to identify mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the Brazilian territory by using phylogenetics and phylodynamics analyses from high-quality genomes. We describe heterogeneous and episodic sequencing efforts, the progression of the different lineages along time, evaluating mutational spectra and frequency oscillations derived from the prevalence of novel and specific lineages across different Brazilian regions. We found at least seven major (1-7) and two minor clades (4.2 and 5.3) related to the six most prevalent Brazilian lineages and described its distribution across the Brazilian territory. The emergence and recent frequency shift of lineages (P.1 and P.2) containing mutations of concern in the spike protein (e. g., E484K, N501Y) draws attention due to their association with immune evasion and enhanced receptor binding affinity. Improvements in genomic surveillance are of paramount importance and should be extended in Brazil to better inform policy makers and enable precise evidence-based decisions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.",Vinicius Bonetti Franceschi; Patricia Aline Grohs Ferrareze; Ricardo Ariel Zimerman; Gabriela Bettella Cybis; Claudia Elizabeth Thompson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253152,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253152,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
257,Forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic integrating symptom search behavior: an infodemiology study,"BackgroundPrevious studies have suggested associations between trends of web searches and COVID-19 traditional metrics. It remains unclear whether models incorporating trends of digital searches lead to better predictions.

MethodsAn open-access web application was developed to evaluate Google Trends and traditional COVID-19 metrics via an interactive framework based on principal components analysis (PCA) and time series modelling. The app facilitates the analysis of symptom search behavior associated with COVID-19 disease in 188 countries. In this study, we selected data of eight countries as case studies to represent all continents. PCA was used to perform data dimensionality reduction, and three different time series models (Error Trend Seasonality, Autoregressive integrated moving average, and feed-forward neural network autoregression) were used to predict COVID-19 metrics in the upcoming 14 days. The models were compared in terms of prediction ability using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the first principal component (PC1). Predictive ability of models generated with both Google Trends data and conventional COVID-19 metrics were compared with those fitted with conventional COVID-19 metrics only.

FindingsThe degree of correlation and the best time-lag varied as a function of the selected country and topic searched; in general, the optimal time-lag was within 15 days. Overall, predictions of PC1 based on both searched termed and COVID-19 traditional metrics performed better than those not including Google searches (median [IQR]: 1.43 [0.74-2.36] vs. 1.78 [0.95-2.88], respectively), but the improvement in prediction varied as a function of the selected country and timeframe. The best model varied as a function of country, time range, and period of time selected. Models based on a 7-day moving average led to considerably smaller RMSE values as opposed to those calculated with raw data (median [IQR]: 0.74 [0.47-1.22] vs. 2.15 [1.55-3.89], respectively).

InterpretationThe inclusion of digital online searches in statistical models may improve the prediction of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Every day clinicians are bombarded with many new treatment options that claim to be better than the others. Materials and methods: After screening the electronic database of COVID-19 patients retrospectively, 56 patients with mild COVID-19 infection matched the inclusion criteria and were divided into the four following groups - group having used Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), group using doxycycline (DOX) + Ivermectin (IVR) combination, group receiving only azithromycin (AZ) and, group receiving only symptomatic treatment. The study's primary objective was to see Clinical response of well-being (CRWB) reporting time after initiating treatment onset between the four different treatment arms. Results: CRWB did not differ between the four groups receiving four different managements (p-value 0.846). There was significant correlation between blood levels of LDH (p-value 0.001), CRP (p-value 0.03) and D-dimer (p-value 0.04) with CRWB in IVR+DOX group and, between LDH (p-value 0.001), CRP (p-value 0.01) and age (p-value 0.035) with CRWB in the symptomatic management group.

259,SARS-CoV-2 seroassay optimization and performance in a population with high background reactivity in Mali,"Serological tests are an indispensable tool to understand the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in areas where molecular diagnostics are limited. Poor assay performance may hinder the utility of these tests, including high rates of false-positivity previously reported in sub-Saharan Africa. From 312 Malian samples collected prior to 2020, we measured antibodies to the commonly tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens and four other betacoronaviruses by ELISA, and assessed functional cross-reactivity in a subset by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. We then evaluated the performance of an ELISA developed in the US, using two-antigen SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain. To optimize test performance, we compared single and two-antigen approaches using existing assay cutoffs and population-specific cutoffs for Malian control samples (positive and negative). Background reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was common in pre-pandemic samples compared to US controls (43.4% (135/311) for spike protein, 22.8% (71/312) for RBD, and 33.9% (79/233) for nucleocapsid protein). SARS-CoV-2 reactivity correlated weakly with other betacoronavirus reactivity, varied between Malian communities, and increased with age. No pre-pandemic samples demonstrated functional activity. Regardless of the cutoffs applied, specificity improved using a two-antigen approach. Test performance was optimal using a two-antigen assay with population-specific cutoffs derived from ROC curve analysis [Sensitivity: 73.9% (51.6-89.8), Specificity: 99.4% (97.7-99.9)].

262,Evolutionary and phenotypic characterization of spike mutations in a new SARS-CoV-2 Lineage reveals two Variants of Interest,"Molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 aims to monitor the appearance of new variants with the potential to change the virulence or transmissibility of the virus. During the first year of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, numerous variants with possible public health impact have emerged. We have detected two mutations in the Spike protein at amino acid positions 1163 and 1167 that have appeared independently multiple times in different genetic backgrounds, indicating they may increase viral fitness. Interestingly, the majority of these sequences appear in transmission clusters, with the genotype encoding mutations at both positions increasing in frequency more than single-site mutants. This genetic outcome that we denote as Lineage B.1.177.637, belongs to clade 20E and includes 12 additional single nucleotide polymorphisms but no deletions with respect to the reference genome (first sequence in Wuhan). B.1.177.637 appeared after the first wave of the epidemic in Spain, and subsequently spread to eight additional countries, increasing in frequency among sequences in public databases. Positions 1163 and 1167 of the Spike protein are situated in the HR2 domain, which is implicated in the fusion of the host and viral membranes. To better understand the effect of these mutations on the virus, we examined whether B.1.177.637 altered infectivity, thermal stability, or antibody sensitivity. Unexpectedly, we observed reduced infectivity of this variant relative to the ancestral 20E variant in vitro while the levels of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs did not vary significantly. In addition, we found the mutations do not impact thermal stability or antibody susceptibility in vaccinated individuals but display a moderate reduction in sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent sera from early stages of the pandemic. Altogether, this lineage could be considered a Variant of Interest (VOI), we denote VOI1163.7. Finally, we detected a sub-cluster of sequences within VOI1163.7 that have acquired two additional changes previously associated with antibody escape and it could be identified as VOI1163.7.V2. Overall, we have detected the spread of a new Spike variant that may be advantageous to the virus and whose continuous transmission poses risks by the acquisition of additional mutations that could affect pre-existing immunity.",Paula Ruiz-Rodriguez; Clara Frances-Gomez; Álvaro Chiner-Oms; Mariana G.

Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was comparable between ethnic-Dutch (25/498; 5.5%, 95%CI=3.2-7.9), South-Asian Surinamese (22/451; 4.8%, 95%CI=2.1-7.5), African Surinamese (22/400; 8.2%, 95%CI=3.0-13.4), Turkish (30/408; 7.8%, 95%CI=4.3-11.2) and Moroccan (32/391; 7.0%, 95%CI=4.0-9.9) participants, but higher among Ghanaians (95/327; 26.5%, 95%CI=18.7-34.4). 57.1% of SARS-CoV-2-positive participants did not suspect or were unsure of being infected, which was lowest in African Surinamese (18.2%) and highest in Ghanaians (90.5%). Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied across ethnic groups, while the most common determinant was having a household member suspected of infection. In Ghanaians, seropositivity was associated with older age, larger household sizes, living with small children, leaving home to work and attending religious services.

ConclusionsNo remarkable differences in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were observed between the largest ethnic groups in Amsterdam after the first wave of infections. The higher infection seroprevalence observed among Ghanaians, which passed mostly unnoticed, warrants wider prevention efforts and opportunities for non-symptom-based testing.",Liza Coyer; Anders Boyd; Janke Schinkel; Charles Agyemang; Henrike Galenkamp; Anitra D.

264,Universal Rule for Covid 19 and Herd Immunity in the US,"A new Universal rule for Covid 19 data is derived in this paper using the SIR model.

It relates infection and removal rates and is validated by the global Covid 19 data. Over 186,000 data points, from 190 countries and the states of the US, for the period April 1 to December 12, 2020 - fall on a single line, as the Universal rule predicts, transcending geography, ethnicity and race.

The Universal rule requires that Herd immunity begin when just 25% of the population is vaccinated. With the anticipated 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of the Biden administration, Herd immunity may be imminent in the US.

The Universal rule promotes a temporary stasis with continuing infections and hospitalizations and becomes a barrier to runaway infections, making it practically impossible to reach Herd immunity, as Sweden discovered. Reduced infected population seems to be a third option to stifle the epidemic - a little known accomplishment, first by North Dakota and subsequently by twelve other U.S. states, including South Dakota.",Jacob Kuriyan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21251577,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21251577,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

266,Process evaluation of the development and remote recruitment for Essential Coaching for Every Mother during COVID-19,"BackgroundWith the sudden decrease in in-person support and increase in perinatal mental health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, innovative strategies, such as mHealth, are more important than ever. This study has two objectives: (1) to describe the modification of Essential Coaching for Every Mother during the coronavirus pandemic, and (2) to describe the process evaluation of recruitment and retention of pregnant and postpartum women for a pre-post intervention study.

MethodsFor objective 1, modified messages were piloted with mothers and postpartum healthcare providers simultaneously. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of 10 participants from the original development study. For objective 2, three methods were used for recruitment: social media, posters in hospital, and media outreach. First time mothers were eligible for enrollment antenatally (37+ weeks) and postnatally (<3 weeks). Eligibility screening occurred remotely via text message with participants initiating contact. Data were collected via TextIt and REDCap. Outcomes were days to recruit 75 participants, eligibility vs. ineligibility rates, dropout and exclusion reasons, survey completion rates, perinatal timing of enrollment, and recruitment sources.

ResultsFor objective 1, three mothers (M age=30.67 years) and seven healthcare providers (M age = 46.0 years) participated in the modification of the messages. Participants felt the messages were appropriate and relevant related to changes in postpartum care during the coronavirus pandemic. Nine messages were modified related to coronavirus and five messages were added to the program. For objective 2, recruitment ran July 15th-September 19th (67 days) with 200 screened and 88 enrolled, 70% antenatally. It took 50 days to enroll 75 participants. Mothers recruited antenatally (n=53) were more likely to receive all intervention message (68% vs. 19%). Mothers recruited postnatally (n=35) missed more messages on average (13.8 vs. 6.4). Participants heard about the study through family/friends (31%), news (20%), Facebook groups (16%), Facebook ads (14%), posters (12%), or other ways (7%).

ConclusionAntenatal recruitment resulted in participants enrolling earlier and receiving more of the study messages. Word of mouth and media outreach were successful, followed by advertisement on Facebook. Remote recruitment was a feasible way to recruit for Essential Coaching for Every Mother.",Justine Dol; Gail Tomblin Murphy; Douglas McMillan; Megan Aston; Marsha Campbell-Yeo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253071,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253071,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
267,"Evaluating the impacts of tiered restrictions introduced in England, during October and December 2020 on COVID-19 cases: A synthetic control study.","BackgroundIn 2020, a second wave of COVID-19 cases unevenly affected places in England leading to the introduction of a tiered system of controls with different geographical areas subject to different levels of restrictions. Whilst previous research has examined the impact of national lockdowns on transmission, there has been limited research examining the marginal effect of differences in localised restrictions or how these effects vary between socioeconomic contexts. We therefore examined how Tier 3 restrictions in England implemented between October-December 2020, which included additional restrictions on the hospitality sector and people meeting outdoors affected COVID-19 case rates, compared to Tier 2 restrictions, and how these effects varied by level of deprivation.

MethodsWe used data on weekly reported COVID-19 cases for 7201 neighbourhoods in England and adjusted these for changing case-detection rates to provide an estimate of weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in each neighbourhood. We identified those areas that entered Tier 3 restrictions at two time points in October and December, and constructed a synthetic control group of similar places that had entered Tier 2 restrictions, using calibration weights to match them on a wide range of covariates that may influence transmission. We then compared the change in weekly infections between those entering Tier 3 to the synthetic control group to estimate the proportional reduction of cases resulting from Tier 3 restrictions compared to Tier 2 restrictions, over a 4-week period. We further used interaction analysis to estimate whether this effect differed based on the level of socioeconomic deprivation in each neighbourhood and whether effects were modified by the prevalence of a new more infectious variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) in each area.

ResultsThe introduction of Tier 3 restrictions in October and December was associated with a 14% (95% CI 10% to 19%) and 20% (95% CI 13% to 29%) reduction in infections respectively, compared to the rates expected if only Tier 2 restrictions had been in place in those areas. We found that effects were similar across levels of deprivation and limited evidence that Tier 3 restrictions had a greater effect in areas where the new more infectious variant was more prevalent.

InterpretationAdditional restrictions on hospitality and meeting outdoors introduced in Tier 3 areas in England had a moderate effect on transmission and these restrictions did not appear to increase inequalities, having a similar impact across areas with differing levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Where transmission risks vary between geographical areas a tiered approach of local restrictions on outdoor mixing and hospitality can contribute to control of SARS-CoV-2 and is unlikely to increases inequalities in transmission.",Xingna Zhang; Gwilym Owen; Mark Green; Iain Buchan; Ben Barr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253165,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
268,Changes in eating habits and lifestyles in Peruvian population during social isolation by the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic caused that some governments have implemented house confinement measures with probable consequences on lifestyle, particularly affecting eating habits, physical activity, sleep quality, and mental health.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the frequency of lifestyles, physical activity and sleep characteristics, as well as changes in eating habits in the Peruvian population during COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA Cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. We analyzed adults from Peru between July to August 2020 based on an online self-administered questionnaire divided into sociodemographic, anthropometrics and COVID-19 diagnostic reported, lifestyle habits and frequency of consumption of foods.

FindingsDuring confinement by COVID-19, 1176 participants were studied, 39% were student, 37.5% were workers and 46% were assert not to work. The population asserted gain weight (1 to 3 Kg) and 35.7% were overweight. The lifestyles habits showed that 54.8% affirmed to doing physical activity and a large proportion (37.2%) asserted sleep less. The Peruvian population presented a main feeding patter of breakfast (95.7%), lunch (97.5%), dinner (89.1%) and brunch (44.9%). Likewise, feeding habits before and during COVID-19 pandemic showed that vegetables (OR:1.56, CI95% 1.21 - 200), fruit (OR: 1.42, CI95% 1.10 - 1.81), legumes (OR:1.67, CI95% 1.23 - 2.28) and eggs (OR: 2.00, CI95% 1.52 - 2.65) presented significantly consumption increase during social isolation, while bakery products (OR: 0.74, CI95% 0.56 - 0.97), meat, snack, refreshment and fast-food decrease consumption. Other food no significant differences were presented.

ConclusionThis study in a Peruvian population showed an important frequency of overweight and sleep disorders.

269,"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Juba, South Sudan: a population-based study","BackgroundRelatively few COVID-19 cases and deaths have been reported through much of sub-Saharan Africa, including South Sudan, although the extent of SARS-CoV-2 spread remains unclear due to weak surveillance systems and few population-representative serosurveys.

MethodsWe conducted a representative household-based cross-sectional serosurvey in Juba, South Sudan. We quantified IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain and estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model accounting for test performance.

ResultsWe recruited 2,214 participants from August 10 to September 11, 2020 and 22.3% had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers above levels in pre-pandemic samples. After accounting for waning antibody levels, age, and sex, we estimated that 38.5% (32.1 - 46.8) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. For each RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 case, 104 (87-126) infections were unreported. Background antibody reactivity was higher in pre-pandemic samples from Juba compared to Boston, where the serological test was validated. The estimated proportion of the population infected ranged from 30.1% to 60.6% depending on assumptions about test performance and prevalence of clinically severe infections.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 has spread extensively within Juba.

Here, we sought to examine this issue by analyzing the serological response observed in 241 KTRs after a first vaccine injection. Our results indicate that KTRs have a weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, ultimately resulting in a low seroconversion rate (26/241, 10.8%).

271,Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins to viral pathogenicity in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, it is estimated that over 113 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 2.5 million human deaths have been recorded worldwide. Currently, three vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use only. However much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2, where we individually removed viral 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 ORF proteins, and characterized these recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF deficient ({Delta}ORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild-type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of {Delta}ORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the {Delta}ORF rSARS-CoV-2 identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while {Delta}ORF7a, {Delta}ORF7b and {Delta}ORF8 rSARS-CoV-2 induced comparable pathology to rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19.

IMPORTANCEDespite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remains elusive. Our study aims to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in viral pathogenesis and disease outcome, and develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse genetics system to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as the foundation to generate attenuated forms of the virus to develop live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.",Jesus Silvas; Desarey Morales Vasquez; Jun-Gyu Park; Kevin Chiem; Jordi Torrelles; Roy Neal Platt; Tim Anderson; Chengjin Ye; Luis Martínez-Sobrido,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434696,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434696,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,False

In spite of the availability of guidelines from state agencies, there is partial confusion about what an optimal rollout plan is. This study investigates effects in a hospital model under different rollout schemes.

MethodsA simulation model is implemented in VBA and studied for parameter variation. The implemented code is available as open access supplement.

Main resultsA rollout scheme assigning vaccine doses to staff primarily by staffs pathogen exposure maximises the predicted open hospital capacity when compared to a rollout based on hierarchical prioritisation. The effect increases under resource scarcity and increasing disease activity. Nursing staff benefits most from an exposure focused rollout.

ConclusionsThe model employs SARS-CoV-2 parameters; nonetheless, effects observable in the model are transferable to other infectious diseases.

274,Quantified Flu: an individual-centered approach to gaining sickness-related insights from wearable data,"BackgroundWearables have been used widely for monitoring health in general and recent research results show that they can be used for predicting infections based on physiological symptoms. So far the evidence has been generated in large, population-based settings. In contrast, the Quantified Self and Personal Science communities are comprised of people interested in learning about themselves individually using their own data, often gathered via wearable devices.

ObjectiveWe explore how a co-creation process involving a heterogeneous community of personal science practitioners can develop a collective self-tracking system to monitor symptoms of infection alongside wearable sensor data.

MethodsWe engaged into a co-creation and design process with an existing community of personal science practitioners, jointly developing a working prototype of an online tool to perform symptom tracking. In addition to the iterative creation of the prototype (started on March 16, 2020), we performed a netnographic analysis, investigating the process of how this prototype was created in a decentralized and iterative fashion.

ResultsThe Quantified Flu prototype allows users to perform daily symptom reporting and is capable of visualizing those symptom reports on a timeline together with the resting heart rate, body temperature and respiratory rate as measured by wearable devices. We observe a high level of engagement, with over half of the 92 users that engaged in the symptom tracking becoming regular users, reporting over three months of data each. Furthermore, our netnographic analysis highlights how the current Quantified Flu prototype is a result of an interactive and continuous co-creation process in which new prototype releases spark further discussions of features and vice versa.

ConclusionsAs shown by the high level of user engagement and iterative development, an open co-creation process can be successfully used to develop a tool that is tailored to individual needs, decreasing dropout rates.",Bastian Greshake Tzovaras; Enric Senabre Hidalgo; Karolina Alexiou; Lukasz Baldy; Basile Morane; Ilona Bussod; Melvin Fribourg; Katarzyna Wac; Gary Wolf; Mad Ball,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252242,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252242,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
275,Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of respiratory Gram-negative bacterial isolates from COVID-19 patients in Switzerland,"BackgroundBacterial superinfections associated with COVID-19 are common in ventilated ICU patients and impact morbidity and lethality. However, the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to the manifestation of bacterial infections in these patients has yet to be elucidated.

MethodsWe collected 70 Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients in Zurich, Switzerland between March and May 2020. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF; antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by EUCAST disk diffusion and CLSI broth microdilution assays. Selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.

ResultsP. aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%) comprised the two largest etiologic groups. Drug resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates was high for piperacillin/tazobactam (65.6%), cefepime (56.3%), ceftazidime (46.9%) and meropenem (50.0%). Enterobacterales isolates showed slightly lower levels of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (32%), ceftriaxone (32%), and ceftazidime (36%). All P. aeruginosa isolates and 92% of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, with apramycin found to provide best-in-class coverage. Genotypic analysis of consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates in one patient revealed a frameshift mutation in the transcriptional regulator nalC that coincided with a phenotypic shift in susceptibility to {beta}-lactams and quinolones.

ConclusionsConsiderable levels of antimicrobial resistance may have contributed to the manifestation of bacterial superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients, and may in some cases mandate consecutive adaptation of antibiotic therapy. High susceptibility to amikacin and apramycin suggests that aminoglycosides may remain an effective second-line treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, provided efficacious drug exposure in lungs can be achieved.",Marina Gysin; Claudio Tirso Acevedo; Klara Haldimann; Elias Bodendoerfer; Frank Imkamp; Karl Bulut; Philipp Karl Buehler; Silvio Daniel Brugger; Katja Becker; Sven N.

In the present study, we examined the diagnostic value of two antigen tests BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag (RapiGEN Inc., Korea) and SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag (Sugentech Inc., Korea) for their diagnostic value in identifying patients who excrete viable SARS-CoV-2. As part of the study, we examined samples from 106 patients who had just been admitted to the hospital, who had undergone quantitative RT-PCR and assessment of viability of SARS-CoV-2 using cell culture. Sensitivity was 0.786 (0.492-0.953) for SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag and 1 (0.768- 1) for Biocredit COVID-19 Ag. Specificity of rapid tests was significantly higher than that of RT-PCR and was 0.663 (0.557-0.758) and 0.674 (0.568-0.768) for SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag and Biocredit COVID-19 Ag versus 0.304 (0.213-0.409) obtained for PCR.

277,Higher viral load drives infrequent SARS-CoV-2 transmission between asymptomatic residence hall roommates,"In 2019-2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread to over 200 countries in less than six months. To understand the basis of this aggressive spread, it is essential to determine the transmission rate and define the factors that increase the risk of transmission. One complication is the large fraction of asymptomatic cases, particularly in young populations: these individuals have viral loads indistinguishable from symptomatic people and do transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they often go undetected. As university students living in residence halls commonly share a small living space with roommates, some schools established regular, high density testing programs to mitigate on-campus spread. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal testing data of residence hall students at the University of Colorado Boulder. We observed that students in single rooms were infected at a lower rate than students in multiple occupancy rooms. However, this was not due to high rates of transmission between roommates, which only occurred approximately 20% of the time. Since these cases were usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, this provides further evidence for asymptomatic transmission. Notably, individuals who likely transmitted to their roommates had an average viral load [~]6.5 times higher than individuals who did not. Although students were moved to separate isolation rooms after diagnosis, there was no difference in time to isolation between these cases with or without transmission. This analysis argues that inter-roommate transmission occurs in a minority of cases in university residence halls and provides strong correlative evidence that viral load can be proportional to the probability of transmission.",Kristen K Bjorkman; Tassa K Saldi; Erika Lasda; Leisha Conners Bauer; Jennifer Kovarik; Patrick K Gonzales; Morgan R Fink; Kimngang L Tat; Cole R Hager; Jack C Davis; Christopher D Ozeroff; Gloria R Brisson; Daniel B Larremore; Leslie A Leinwand; Matthew B McQueen; Roy Parker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253147,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253147,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

ObjectiveTo examine the possible impact of obesity on COVID-19 death rates.

DesignMeasure associations between obesity rates in 2016 and COVID-19 deaths/million population through 2/25/2021, across countries.

SettingGlobal

Participants167 countries for which obesity and death data were available, grouped by population size, with multiples of 10 countries in each of 8 groups plus a group including all 57 countries with obesity rates <15%.

Outcome and measuresUsing Excel, COVID-19 deaths/million were regressed on the obesity rate for each country, based on obesity being a key factor in COVID hospitalizations and deaths. Using the least squares formula for the best fit for each model, R2, components of the formula, and the percentage of world population represented, were recorded for each group.

ResultsObesity rates ranged from 2.1% to 37.9% and death rates ranged from 0.4/million to 1,892/million for groups representing up to 91% of global population.

279,Analytical and clinical performances of a SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG assay: comparison with neutralization titers,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 serology presents an important role in understanding the virus epidemiology, in vaccine prioritization strategies and in convalescent plasma therapy. Immunoassays performances have to be accurately evaluated and correlated with neutralizing antibodies to be used as a surrogate measure of neutralizing activity. We investigate the analytical and clinical performance of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay, automated on a high throughput platform, and the correlation of the antibodies (Ab) levels with the plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT50) Ab titers.

MethodsA series of 546 samples were evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay (Snibe diagnostics), including 171 negative and 168 positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects and a further group of 207 subjects of the COVID-19 family clusters follow-up cohort.

ResultsAssay precision was acceptable at low and medium levels; linearity was excellent in all the measurement range. Considering specimens collected after 14 days post symptoms onset, overall sensitivity and specificity were 99.0% and 92.5%, respectively. A total of 281 leftover samples results of the PRNT50 test were available. An elevated correlation was obtained between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay and the PRNT50 titer at univariate (rho = 0.689) and multivariate (rho = 0.712) analyses.

280,An In-House ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 RBD uncovers elevatedimmune response at higher altitudes,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) first reported in Wuhan has caused a global pandemic with dramatic health and socioeconomic consequences. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated represents a challenge for health systems that had to quickly respond developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In the present work, we developed an ""In House"" ELISA with high sensitivity (92.2 %), specificity (100%) and precision (93.9%), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.991, rendering the assay as an excellent serological test to correctly discriminate between SARS-COv-2 infected and non-infected individuals and study population seroprevalence. Among 758 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the province of Tucuman, Argentina, we found a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5048 between antibodies elicited against the RBD and the nucleocapsid (N) antigen. Additionally, 33.6% of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 displayed mild levels of RBD-IgG antibodies, while 19% of the patients showed high antibody titers. Interestingly, patients with SARS-COV-2 infection over 60 years old elicited significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies against RBD compared to younger ones, while no difference was found between women and men. Surprisingly, individuals from a high altitude village displayed statistically significant higher and longer lasting anti-RBD antibodies compared to those from a city at a lower altitude, suggesting that a hypobaric hypoxia-adapted mechanism may act as a protective factor for COVID-19.

281,A Recovery Algorithm and Pooling Designs for One-Stage Noisy Group Testing under the Probabilistic Framework,"Group testing saves time and resources by testing each pre-assigned group instead of each individual, and one-stage group testing emerged as essential for cost-effectively controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the practical challenge of adjusting pooling designs based on infection rate has not been systematically addressed. In particular, there are both theoretical interests and practical motivation to analyze one-stage group testing at finite, practical problem sizes, rather than asymptotic ones, under noisy, rather than perfect tests, and when the number of positives is randomly distributed, rather than fixed.

Here, we study noisy group testing under the probabilistic framework by modeling the infection vector as a random vector with Bernoulli entries. Our main contributions include a practical one-stage group testing protocol guided by maximizing pool entropy and a maximum-likelihood recovery algorithm under the probabilistic framework. Our findings high-light the implications of introducing randomness to the infection vectors - we find that the combinatorial structure of the pooling designs plays a less important role than the parameters such as pool size and redundancy.",Yining Liu; Sachin Kadyan; Itsik Pe'er,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253193,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253193,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

While these studies have explored a variety of modeling techniques, all have relied on simulated data. Here, we use an empirical proximity network of college freshmen 10, ascertained using smartphone Bluetooth, to simulate the spread of the virus. We investigate the role of testing, isolation, mask wearing, and social distancing in the presence of implementation challenges and imperfect compliance. Here we show that while frequent testing can drastically reduce spread if mask wearing and social distancing are not widely adopted, testing has limited impact if they are ubiquitous. Furthermore, even moderate levels of immunity can significantly reduce new infections, especially when combined with other interventions. Our findings suggest that while testing and isolation are powerful tools, they have limited benefit if other interventions are widely adopted. If universities can attain high levels of masking and social distancing, they may be able to relax testing frequency to once every two to four weeks.",Hali L Hambridge; Rebecca Kahn; Jukka-Pekka Onnela,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253198,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253198,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
284,Rapid screening for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in clinical and environmental samples using nested RT-PCR assays targeting key mutations of the Spike protein,"New SARS-CoV-2 mutations are constantly emerging, raising concerns of increased transmissibility, virulence or escape from host immune response.

We describe a nested RT-PCR assay ([~]1500 bps) to detect multiple key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the three Variants of Concern (VOCs) 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20J/501Y.V3 (Brazil), as well as the 20E.EU1 variant (Spain), the CAL.20C recently identified in California, and the mink-associated variant (GR, lineage B.1.1.298). Prior to application to field samples, the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage, where the amplification of long fragments is problematic, two short nested RT-PCR assays ([~]300 bps) were also designed, targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay.

The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples, including 7 fully-sequenced viral isolates from swab samples and 34 urban wastewater samples, some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported.

The long assay successfully amplified all the previously characterized viral isolates, allowing the correct identification of variants 20I/501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs (UK and Brazilian variant) and of other variant (Spanish) were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20J/501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters, highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity.

The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest. This can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens. The assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost-effective detection of VOCs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater-based epidemiology. The approach proposed here can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity, geographic distribution and impact worldwide.",Giuseppina La Rosa; Pamela Mancini; Giusy Bonanno Ferraro; Carolina Veneri; Marcello Iaconelli; Luca Lucentini; Lucia Bonadonna; Silvio Brusaferro; David Brandtner; Antonio Fasanella; Lorenzo Pace; Antonio Parisi; Domenico Galante; Elisabetta Suffredini,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252450,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252450,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
285,Therapeutic Anticoagulation in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19-Preliminary Report,"BackgroundThrombosis may contribute to morbidity and mortality in Covid-19. We hypothesized that therapeutic anticoagulation would improve outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19.

MethodsWe conducted an open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized, clinical trial. Patients with severe Covid-19, defined as the requirement for organ support with high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, vasopressors, or inotropes, were randomized to receive therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin or pharmacological thromboprophylaxis as per local usual care. The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21.

ResultsTherapeutic anticoagulation met the pre-defined criteria for futility in patients with severe Covid-19. The primary outcome was available for 1,074 participants (529 randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation and 545 randomized to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis). Median organ support-free days were 3 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and 5 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio 0.87, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.70-1.08, posterior probability of futility [odds ratio<1.2] 99.8%). Hospital survival was comparable between groups (64.3% vs. 65.3%, adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% CrI 0.67-1.16). Major bleeding occurred in 3.1% of patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and 2.4% of patients assigned to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

ConclusionsIn patients with severe Covid-19, therapeutic anticoagulation did not improve hospital survival or days free of organ support compared to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

286,Model Based Estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 Immunization Level in Austria and Consequences for Herd Immunity Effects,"Several systemic factors indicate, that worldwide herd immunity against COVID-19 will probably not be achieved in 2021. Vaccination programs are limited by availability of doses, the number of people already infected is still too low to have a disease preventing impact and new emerging variants of the virus seem to partially neglect developed antibodies from previous infections. Nevertheless, after one year of COVID-19 observing high numbers of reported cases in most European countries, we might expect that the immunization level should have an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We used an agent-based simulation model to reproduce the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria to estimate the immunization level of the population as of February 2021. We ran several simulations of an uncontrolled epidemic wave with varying initial immunization scenarios to assess the effect on the effective reproduction number. We also used a classic differential equation SIR-model to cross-validate the simulation model. As of February 2021, 14.7% of the Austrian population has been affected by a SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes a 9% reduction of the effective reproduction number and a 24.7% reduction of the prevalence peak compared to a fully susceptible population. This estimation is now recomputed on a regular basis to publish model based analysis of immunization level in Austria also including the fast growing effects of vaccination programs. This provides substantial information for decision makers to evaluate the necessity of NPI-measures based on the estimated impact of natural and vaccinated immunization.",Martin Richard Bicher; Claire Rippinger; Günter Richard Schneckenreither; Nadine Weibrecht; Christoph Urach; Melanie Zechmeister; Dominik Brunmeir; Wolfgang Huf; Niki Popper,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253251,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253251,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
287,"Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated risk factors among frontline health care workers in Paris, France: the SEROCOV prospective cohort study","BackgroundWith the COVID-19 pandemic, documenting whether health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and identifying risk factors is of major concern.

MethodsIn this multicenter prospective cohort study, HCWs from frontline departments were included in March and April 2020 and followed for 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed at month 0 (M0), M1, and M3 and RT-PCR in case of symptoms. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Risk factors of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 were identified by multivariate logistic regression.

ResultsAmong 1,062 HCWs (median [interquartile range] age, 33 [28-42] years; 758 [71.4%] women; 321 [30.2%] physicians), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 was 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [12.5; 16.9]). Risk factors were the working department specialty, with increased risk for intensive care units (odds ratio 1.80, 95%CI [0.38; 8.58]), emergency departments (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and infectious diseases departments (4.22 [0.92; 18.28]); active smoking was associated with reduced risk (0.36 [0.21; 0.63]). Age, sex, professional category, number of years of experience in the job or department, and public transportation use were not significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3.

ConclusionThe rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in frontline HCWs was 14.6% at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in Paris and occurred mainly early. The study argues for an origin of professional in addition to private life contamination and therefore including HCWs in the first-line vaccination target population. It also highlights that smokers were at lower risk.

Like many other countries, it was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic since late January 2020, with recurring waves of infection. This study aimed at combining genomic and epidemiological data to unravel the source of SARS-CoV-2 introduction, transmission and evolution in the country.

MethodsWe performed meta-transcriptomic sequencing of 1,067 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from qRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients in Abu Dhabi, UAE, between May 9th and June 29th 2020. We investigated the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of the viral population and analyzed the infection and transmission potential of novel genomic clusters. Within-host SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation was analyzed to determine the occurrence and prevalence of multiple infections. Finally, we evaluated innate host responses during the prolonged period of local infection.

ResultsAll globally known SARS-CoV-2 clades were identified within the UAE sequenced strains, with a higher occurrence of European and East Asian clades. We defined 5 subclades based on 11 unique genetic variants within the UAE strains, which were associated with no significantly different viral loads. Multiple infection of different SARS-CoV-2 strains was observed for at least 5% of the patients. We also discovered an enrichment of cytosine-to-uracil mutation among the viral population collected from the nasopharynx, that is different from the adenosine-to-inosine change previously observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. This observation is accompanied with an upregulation of APOBEC4, an under-studied putative cytidine-uridine editing enzyme in the infected nasopharynx.

ConclusionsThe genomic epidemiological and molecular biological knowledge obtained in the study provides new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission.

290,COVID-19: Optimal Allocation of Ventilator Supply under Uncertainty and Risk,"This study presents a new risk-averse multi-stage stochastic epidemics-ventilator-logistics compartmental model to address the resource allocation challenges of mitigating COVID-19. This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.",Xuecheng Yin; I.

291,Immune response during lactation after anti-SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine,"ImportanceData regarding efficacy and safety of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during lactation is needed to address vaccination guidelines, ease vaccine hesitancy concerns, and inform public health strategies for this population.

ObjectiveTo determine whether anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines administered during lactation illicit an immune response or the transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies into human milk.

DesignPlasma and milk samples were collected from a prospective cohort of lactating individuals who received the mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 and from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 infection.

SettingAmbulatory or during postpartum hospitalization.

ParticipantsWe report results from lactating participants who received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna, n=9) or the BNT162b2 (Pfizer, n=14) vaccine or recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=3).

Interventions and ExposuresAnti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273) or natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Plasma and milk samples were collected from lactating individuals before first vaccine dose, on the day of the second dose, and 4 weeks after the second dose. Maternal plasma was evaluated for vaccine-derived IgM and IgG antibodies. Human milk was evaluated by ELISA for vaccine-induced IgA antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsTwenty-three lactating individuals were recruited for this study. Levels of IgG and IgM were significantly increased in plasma samples on the day of the second vaccine dose (post vaccine 1), when compared to pre-vaccine samples. In addition, plasma IgG levels 4 weeks after second vaccine dose were significantly higher than plasma IgG levels pre-vaccine or on the day of the second dose. In addition, our results show transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgA antibodies to human milk, 3-4 weeks after each dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273). The levels of anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA antibody in milk of vaccinated individuals were not significantly different from levels among participants who experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions and RelevanceAdministration of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during lactation leads to increased anti-SARS-CoV2 IgM and IgG levels in the plasma of lactating mothers and increased anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA levels in human milk. Lactating women who receive the vaccine should continue breastfeeding their infant human milk to allow continuing transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies to the neonate. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of these vaccines on lactation outcomes and infant health.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the immunologic response to anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines during lactation and does vaccination induce secretion of IgA antibodies into human milk?

FindingsIn a cohort of 23 lactating individuals who were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found significantly increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgM antibodies in plasma, as well as anti-SARS-CoV2 IgA in human milk.

We analysed whether these changes impacted the rate of violent and aggressive incidents across acute adult wards and psychiatric intensive care units in a South London NHS Mental Health Trust during the first UK lockdown.

MethodsWe used an interrupted time series analysis to assess whether the rate of violent and aggressive incidents changed during the lockdown period from 23rd March 2020 to 15th June 2020. We used a quasi-poisson general additive model to model the weekly rate of violent incidents as a function of a seasonal trend, time trend, and impact of lockdown, using data from 1st January 2017 to 27th September 2020.

293,Acceptability of contact management and care of simple cases of COVID-19 at home: a mixed-method study in Senegal,"IntroductionIn mid-2020, due to the health system challenges from increased COVID-19 cases, the Ministry of Health and Social Action in Senegal opted for contact management and care of simple cases at home. The studys objective was to determine the acceptability of contact management, home care of simple cases of COVID-19, and its associated factors.

MethodThis was a sequential mixed-method study. We collected data from June 11, 2020, to July 10, 2020, for the quantitative survey (N=813) and from August 24 to September 16, 2020, for the qualitative survey (N=30). We carried out a sampling strategy using marginal quotas at the national level. We collected data using a structured questionnaire in a telephone interview for the quantitative survey and using an interview guide formulated from the quantitative surveys initial results for the qualitative data. We assessed acceptability using binomial logistic regression combined with content analysis.

ResultsThe care of simple cases of COVID-19 at home was well accepted (78.5%). This result was justified for some (saturation of the health system) but not for others (risk of contamination). The use of home contact management was less accepted (51.4%), with risk limitation as the main reason given. The acceptability of home-based care for simple cases was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.55 [95%CI: 1.04,2.28]), regular research into COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.12 [95%CI: 1.45,3.12]), belief in the existence of treatment (ORaj: 1.82 [95%CI: 1.19,2.83]), and confidence in institutional information (ORaj: 2.10 [95%CI: 1.43,3.10]). The acceptability of home-based contact management was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.77 [95%CI: 1.27,2.48]), regular research for information on COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.39 [95%CI: 1.76,3.26]), and confidence in the government in the fight against the epidemic (ORaj: 1.51 [95%CI: 1.10,2.08]).

ConclusionRegular information on the disease, knowledge of its mode of transmission and trust in institutions are factors in accepting COVID-19 management at the community level. Authorities should take these factors into account for better communication to improve the acceptability of home-based care.",Mouhamadou Faly Ba; Valery Ridde; Amadou Ibra Diallo; Jean Augustin Diegane Tine; Babacar Kane; Ibrahima Gaye; Zoumana Traore; Emmanuel Bonnet; Adama Faye,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253266,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253266,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
294,An Extended COVID-19 Epidemiological Model with Vaccination and Multiple Interventions for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK,"There has been a second outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the UK in 2020. In this situation, the UK re-implemented the lockdown intervention strategy. Different from the first COVID outbreak, the second outbreak is accompanied by two new situations: 1) There are at least three new variant strains in the UK and they are more infectious than the original strain. The mutant strain considered in the experimental simulation accounts for the majority of all strains of the mutant infection in the UK. 2) The official start of a vaccination programme in the UK started in mid-December 2020. As the date for lifting the third lockdown approaches, what kind of intervention measures will the UK continue to take: curb the spread of the COVID epidemic, reduce medical needs and allow people to return to normal life and revitalize the national economy as quickly as possible. Targeting at this problem, this article conduct a feasibility study by defining the mathematical model SEMCVRD (Susceptible [S], Exposed [E] (infected but asymptomatic), Mild [M] and Critical [C] (mild cases, severe and critical cases), [V] (vaccinated), Recovered [R] and Deceased [D]), which is expanded the traditional SEIR (Susceptible [S], Exposed [E], Infectious [I], Recovered [R]) model by adding two key features: the mixed infection of the mutant strain and the original strain and the addition of a new group who have been vaccinated. The model uses a public data set for fitting and evaluation. The dataset contains daily new infections, new deaths and daily vaccination in the UK from February 2020 to February 2021. Based on the simulation results, the following content was found : 1) There are simulated the mixed infection of the new mutant virus and the original virus in the UK. Under the assumption that the vaccine is effective against the new virus, continuing to promote the injection of the vaccine in society can effectively inhibit the spread and infection of the new mutant virus. Predicting that if UK could continuously implement insensitive suppression, COVID-19 epidemic would be able to control by 9th April 2021 and would be nearly ended by 1st May 2020. 2) With the increasing number of people vaccinated and immunized against the virus, the lifting of the third lockdown in the UK is coming. Using a phased and progressive lifting intervention strategy with an intensity of 3 is our best choice at present. Under this strategy, on 30th June 2021, the total number of infections in the UK will be limited to 4.2 million and the total number of deaths in the UK is 135 thousand. If the lockdown is lifted directly, the total number of infections in the UK will increase to 8 million and the total number of deaths in the UK will be 279 thousand on 30th June 2021. It can be seen from the above that our strategy compared to directly lifting the lockdown can greatly reduce the total number of infections and deaths. People can return to normal life and social distancing after four months. The epidemic will nearly end in 6th June 2021 (The sign of the end: the number of new infections per day is less than 1,000 and the number of new deaths per day is less than 35). In addition, according to our prediction, under this kind of intervention, the UK will not experience a shortage of medical resources as it did in the first half of 2020. 3) In the case that it is possible to provide people with 600 thousand vaccinations(double the quantity now provided) every day, a higher intensity (intensity 5) Phase intervention strategy can be trying to nearly end the epidemic earlier (25th May 2021) and restore peoples normal life and social distance.",Shuhao Zhang; Gaoshan Bi; Yun Yang; Jun Qi; Shujun Li; Xuxin Mao; Ruoling Peng; Po Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252748,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252748,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
295,A phase 2 study of the inhaled pan-JAK inhibitor TD-0903 in severe COVID-19: Part 1,"BackgroundLung-targeted anti-inflammatory therapy could potentially improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The novel inhaled pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor TD-0903 was designed to optimise delivery to the lungs while limiting systemic exposure. Here, we report results from the completed Part 1 of a 2-part phase 2 trial (NCT04402866) in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19.

MethodsPart 1 explored 3 doses of TD-0903 (1, 3, and 10 mg once-daily for 7 days) and placebo in a randomised, double-blind, ascending-dose study. Each dose cohort comprised 8 hospitalized patients (6:2 TD-0903:placebo) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen and receiving background standard-of-care therapy. Key objectives included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; clinical outcomes were also explored. Data were summarised as descriptive statistics.

ResultsTwenty-five patients were randomised to receive TD-0903 1 mg (n = 6), 3 mg (n = 7), 10 mg (n = 6), or placebo (n = 6). Almost all patients (92%) received background dexamethasone; 3 (12%) received remdesivir. TD-0903 was generally well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. Low plasma concentrations of TD-0903 were observed at all doses. Clinically favourable numerical trends in patients receiving TD-0903 vs placebo included improved 8-point clinical status, shortened hospitalisation, improved oxygenation, and fewer deaths.

ConclusionsIn Part 1 of this phase 2 trial, the novel inhaled JAK inhibitor TD-0903 showed potential for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. TD-0903 3 mg is being evaluated in Part 2 of the randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 198 hospitalized patients with COVID-19.",Dave Singh; Maxim Bogus; Valentyn Moskalenko; Robert Lord; Edmund J Moran; Glenn D Crater; David L Bourdet; Nathan D Pfeifer; Jacky Woo; Elad Kaufman; David A Lombardi; Emily Y Weng; Tuan Nguyen; Ashley Woodcock; Brett Haumann; Rajeev Saggar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252944,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252944,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

There is concern about the spread of coronavirus in regions with lower education level, weaker health systems and underdeveloped economy. The risk of viral transmission in HD center is elevated because of the densely-populated and high mobility in an enclosed environment.This paper demonstrated the main experiences and strategies of preventing secondary COVID-19 transmission in a HD center from a poverty-stricken rural region in China. Data of subjects including 17 medical workers and 249 patients were collected from the HD center in Huangchuan County Peoples Hospital from February to April 2020.

298,Development and validation of a clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of severe COVID-19,"Age, sex, and comorbidities are known risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are frequently considered independently and without accurate knowledge of the magnitude of their effects on risk. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk of severe COVID-19 have appeared in the literature, but their application in predictive risk testing has not been validated. Reliance on age and sex alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will fail to accurately quantify risk. Here, we report the development and validation of a clinical and genetic model to predict risk of severe COVID-19 using confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive participants from the UK Biobank. Our new model out-performed an age and sex model and had excellent discrimination and was well calibrated in the validation dataset. We also report validation studies of our prototype model and polygenic risk scores based on 8-SNP and 6-SNP panels identified in the literature.

Here we describe a nationwide campaign to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater of 159 counties in 40 U.S. states, covering 13% of the U.S. population from February 18 to June 2, 2020. Out of 1,751 total samples analyzed, 846 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with overall viral concentrations declining from April to May. Wastewater viral titers were consistent with, and appeared to precede, clinical COVID-19 surveillance indicators, including daily new cases. Wastewater surveillance had a high detection rate (>80%) of SARS-CoV-2 when the daily incidence exceeded 13 per 100,000 people. Detection rates were positively associated with wastewater treatment plant catchment size. To our knowledge, this work represents the largest-scale wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 monitoring campaign to date, encompassing a wide diversity of wastewater treatment facilities and geographic locations.

300,The BioNTech / Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 induces class-switched SARS-CoV-2-specific plasma cells and potential memory B cells as well as IgG and IgA serum and IgG saliva antibodies upon the first immunization,"To treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that enters the body through the respiratory tract, different vaccines in particular against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein have been developed or are in the development process. For the BioNTech / Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, which is injected twice, protection against COVID-19 has been described for the first weeks after the second vaccination. The underlying mechanisms of defense and the long-term effectiveness of this vaccine against COVID-19 are currently under investigation.

In addition to the induction of systemic antibodies (Abs), Ab responses in the respiratory tract would help to form a first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, protection depends on Fab-part-dependent neutralizing capacities, however, Fc-part-mediated effector mechanisms might also be important. Long-term defense would be based on the induction of long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells (PCs) and memory B cells.

Here, we established different assays to analyze anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG and IgA Abs in blood serum and saliva as well as SARS-CoV-2-S1-reactive IgG and IgA PCs and potential memory B cells in the blood of individuals upon their first immunization with BNT162b2.

We show that the vaccine induces in particular anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG1 and IgG3 as well as IgA1 and in some individuals also IgG2 and IgA2 serum Abs. In the saliva, we found no anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgA, but instead IgG Abs. Furthermore, we found SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgG+ blood PCs and potential memory B cells as well as SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgA+ PCs and/or potential memory B cells in some individuals.

Our data suggest that the vaccine induces a promising CD4+ T cell-dependent systemic IgG1 and IgG3 Ab response with IgG+ PCs and potential memory B cells. In addition to the systemic IgG response, the systemic IgA and saliva IgG response might help to improve a first line of defense in the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants.",Anne Sophie Lixenfeld; inga Kuensting; Emily L.

301,Bayesian inference across multiple models suggests a strong increase in lethality of COVID-19 in late 2020 in the UK,"We apply Bayesian inference methods to a suite of distinct compartmental models of generalised SEIR type, in which diagnosis and quarantine are included via extra compartments. We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK, using age-structured, weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a (step-like or graded) change in infection fatality rate (IFR) have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover, they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However, the same models consistently infer that, most probably, the increase in IFR preceded the time window during which new variant B.1.1.7 became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore, according to our models, the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality of a new variant. We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France, which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period, despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant(s) may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020, other factors, such as seasonality, or pressure on health services, are likely to also have contributed.

SummaryO_ST_ABSModel structureC_ST_ABSWe study a family of non-geographic compartmented models structured by age, and by epidemiological and diagnostic state. They include stages within exposed (E) and infected (I) classes, and separation of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals; E and I classes are subdivided according to whether they have had a positive test.

Disease transmission between compartments is modelled by contact matrices derived from survey data and previous Bayesian inference [1]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are incorporated via time- and age-dependent transmission rates. This dependence is parameterised by functions that account for lockdowns, seasonal changes, etc., with parameters inferred from the data except where known a priori (e.g. lockdown dates).

The process of diagnosis is modelled explicitly through the subdivided compartments. The targeting of tests towards symptomatic individuals is controlled by a single inferred parameter. Tested individuals have reduced infectivity, as a model for self-isolation. The fraction of asymptomatic cases is presumed fixed. Most other parameters are inferred (including initial conditions in March 2020). Our models are stochastic at all stages, including the infection and the diagnosis processes.

Similar models are considered for Germany and France. All models are analysed with the same Bayesian methodology as outlined below.

DataWe analyse age-structured, weekly data for cases and mortalities for the UK, France and Germany starting in early March 2020. Our explicit modelling of diagnostic tests allows us to directly use data on the number of daily tests performed and their outcomes to inform parameter estimation. For the UK, the data we used are (i) ONS data for COVID deaths; (ii) PHE data for total numbers of tests; (iii) PHE data for numbers of positive tests. The time series analysed extends from March 2020 until January 2021.

MethodsIn line with the data used, we treat diagnosed cases and mortalities as the only observables; other compartments are treated as unobserved, with occupancies to be inferred from data. Parameters governing overdispersion for infection and death are likewise inferred.

We perform inference using a likelihood function that includes the stochasticity in all model transitions (infection, disease progression, testing, death). The likelihood of the observed data is computed in an approximation that becomes exact for large population sizes, taking into account all statistical dependencies in this limit. Inference is performed at the level of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. Using these MAP estimates we approximate the evidence for each model, allowing us to compare the credibility of different models given the same set of data.

We use the software package PyRoss to build all the models and run the inference procedure [2, 3].

Model specificationsWe compare several distinct models that differ primarily in how interventions and fluctuations are addressed. Some of these variants (Type 1) allow for a time-dependent infection fatality rate (IFR) and some do not (Type 0). Most of our Type 1 models assume a step change in IFR but a ramped (tanh) variation is also studied. In Type 1 models, the values of IFR before and after the change are parameterised in terms of their log-ratio, whose prior is normal distributed with mean zero and standard deviation log(3). The prior for the time of the change is normal with mean 2020-12-12 and standard deviation 2 weeks.

For both Type 0 and Type 1 models we consider several possibilities for the time-dependence of model parameters other than the IFR. For the UK, these are (A) no dependence; (B) changing infectivity; (C) changing overdispersion: (BC) changing infectivity and overdispersion.

FindingsType 1 models for the UK consistently attain a significantly higher model evidence than Type 0 models. (Specifically, they show systematically larger values of the log-posterior.) For each Type 1 model, we separately infer that in the UK, the IFR rose by a factor of about two in late October or early November 2020: the MAP values vary between 1.9-2.2 depending on the model chosen. A similar change is also inferred in Germany and France, but is somewhat less pronounced.

Among the France/Germany models, the ratios of inferred IFRs before/after the step are smaller than in UK but still indicate significant changes, around 1.4 for France and 1.8 for Germany.

The IFR changes in UK are inferred to take place significantly before the B.1.1.7 variant became the dominant UK strain. The significant inferred IFR change in Germany is (to our knowledge) not associated with any new variant.

InterpretationThese findings support the hypothesis [4-6] that the lethality of COVID-19 in the UK increased significantly in late autumn 2020. The MAP estimates further suggest that a larger increase than previously suggested [4, 5], of roughly a factor 2, arose with an onset time in early November. However, the fact that this onset time precedes the rise to dominance of new variant B.1.1.7 suggests that this rise is not solely responsible for the change in IFR. Other factors, such as seasonality and/or pressure on health services, may also be important. If these factors came into play significantly before the arrival of B.1.1.7, then the MAP-estimated onset time of early November could represent a compromise between two successive episodes of increasing IFR within models that, as so far implemented, allow only one.

Note that the IFR depends on the true number of infections (not just diagnosed cases as in the case fatality rate) which, in our model, is itself estimated from the data for cases and testing. Underestimation of this number can lead to an overestimate of the IFR. However, to explain the factor-two increase in fitted IFR this way would require implausible assumptions to be made concerning change in testing efficacy in late autumn 2020 (models TT0, TT1, P0).",Patrick Pietzonka; Erik Brorson; William Bankes; Michael E Cates; Robert L Jack; Ronojoy Adhikari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253311,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253311,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
302,Disulfiram associated with lower risk of Covid-19: a retrospective cohort study,"In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is a substantial need for effective, low-cost therapeutics. We investigated the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in an observational study in a large database of US Veterans Administration clinical records, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). The study is motivated by the unique properties of disulfiram, which has been used as an anti-alcoholism drug since 1948, is non-toxic, easy to manufacture and inexpensive. Disulfiram reduces hyperinflammation in mammalian cells by inhibition of the gasdermin D pore. In a mouse model of sepsis, disulfiram reduced inflammatory cytokines and mortality. Disulfiram also is a low micromolar inhibitor of the Mpro and PLpro viral proteases of SARS-CoV-2.

To investigate the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and severity of COVID-19, we carried out an epidemiological study in the CDW. The VA dataset used has 944,127 patients tested for SARS-Cov-2, 167,327 with a positive test, and 2,233 on disulfiram, of which 188 had a positive SARS-Cov-2 test. A multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorders, and Charlson comorbidity score revealed a reduced incidence of COVID-19 with disulfiram use with a hazard ratio of 0.66 and 95% confidence interval of 0.57 to 0.76 (P < 0.001). There were no deaths among the 188 SARS-Cov-2 positive patients treated with disulfiram. The expected number of deaths would have been 5-6 according to the 3% death rate among the untreated (P-value 0.03).

Our finding of a lower hazard ratio and less severe outcomes for COVID-19 in patients treated with disulfiram compared to those not treated is a statistical association and does not prove any causative effect of disulfiram. However, the results of this study suggest that there is a pharmacological contribution to the reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19 with the use of disulfiram. Given the known anti-inflammatory and viral anti-protease effects of disulfiram, it is reasonable and urgent to initiate accelerated clinical trials to assess whether disulfiram reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity and death.

STRUCTURED OUTLINEO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSIdentifying already approved medications with well characterized antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties supported by real world evidence as candidates for clinical trials for repurposing is an important strategy to manage the pandemic given the ongoing challenges with producing and administering vaccines, the emergence of more infectious viral mutants and the paucity of approved therapies.

304,Spread and sources of information and misinformation about COVID-19 early during the pandemic in a U.S. national cohort study,"BackgroundEarly in the pandemic, misinformation about COVID-19 was spread on social media. The purpose of this study was to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information and claims seen and believed about COVID-19 early in the pandemic among U.S. adults. Then, we assessed the impact of believing such claims on engaging in personal protective actions (PPA).

MethodsWe used baseline data from the CHASING COVID Cohort (n = 7,070) collected March 28, 2020 to April 20, 2020 to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information as well as claims circulating on social media that had been seen and believed. We used Poisson regression to determine the association of believing certain claims with engaging in a higher number of PPA.

ResultsThe top three trusted sources of COVID-19 information were the CDC (67.9%), the WHO (53.7%), and State Health Departments (53.0%). Several COVID-19 claims circulated on social media had been seen, e.g., that the virus was created in a laboratory (54.8%). Moreover, substantial proportions of participants indicated agreement with some of these claims. In multivariable regression, we found that belief in certain claims was associated with engaging in a higher number of PPA. For example, believing that paper masks would prevent transmission of the virus was associated with engaging in a higher number of protective actions ({beta} = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.004 - 0.046).

305,The impact of headache disorders on COVID-19 survival: a world population-based analysis,"ImportanceCOVID-19 has not impacted people or countries uniformly. This disparity has prompted investigations to identify clinical and genetic predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Headache, a COVID-19 symptom, has been associated with positive disease prognosis. It is logical to consider whether primary headache disorders, among the most prevalent and disabling diseases globally, may also be associated with reduced viral mortality and thereby may have arisen as adaptive host defences

ObjectiveTo study the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and primary headache disorders.

Main outcome measureUsing a generalized additive model regression (GAM), we analysed data across 171 nations to identify variables which impact COVID-19 mortality rates (demographics, national wealth and government effectiveness, pandemic management indexes, latitude of the countrys capital, prevalence of headache disorders and other diseases). We performed similar analyses of seasonal influenza mortality. Separately, we meta-analysed studies of COVID-19 inpatient survival reporting headache, using PRISMA guidelines.

ResultsIn the global population-level analysis, we observed that a higher prevalence of headache disorders was associated with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate, and represented the main variable contributing to differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between countries (37.8%; F value=10.68). By contrast, we observed a negative trend between the prevalence of headache disorders and influenza death rates. Controversially, when considering headache as a symptom of COVID-19, in the 48 meta-analysed studies we observed a significantly higher risk ratio of survival (RR:2.178 [1.882-2.520], p<0.0001) among COVID-19 inpatients with headache.

Conclusions and RelevanceHeadache as a primary disorder is more prevalent in nations with higher COVID-19 mortality, whereas headache as a COVID-19 symptom is associated with enhanced survival. Further studies should clarify whether primary headache disorders represent a risk factor for mortality for COVID-19 or, rather, whether this association reflects evolutionary adaptive processes to enhance survival that, in the case of COVID-19, are insufficiently protective.",Robert E.

306,Mapping the human genetic architecture of COVID-19 by worldwide meta-analysis,"The genetic makeup of an individual contributes to susceptibility and response to viral infection. While environmental, clinical and social factors play a role in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease severity, host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors indicate biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprising 49,562 COVID-19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries worldwide. We reported 15 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. We further identified smoking and body mass index as causal risk factors for severe COVID-19. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19, with unprecedented speed, was enabled by prioritization of shared resources and analytical frameworks.

At each of 455 PM2.5 monitoring sites across the United States, we conduct a causal inference analysis to determine the impacts of COVID-19 interventions and behavioral changes (""lockdowns"") on PM2.5 concentrations. Our approach allows for rigorous confounding adjustment and provides highly spatio-temporally resolved effect estimates. We find that, with the exception of the Southwest, most of the US experienced increases in PM2.5 during lockdown, compared to the concentrations expected under business-as-usual. To investigate possible drivers of this phenomenon, we use regression to characterize the relationship of many environmental, geographical, meteorological, mobility, and socioeconomic factors with the lockdown-attributable changes in PM2.5.

308,Impact of close interpersonal contact on COVID-19 incidence: evidence from one year of mobile device data,"Close contact between people is the primary route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to quantify interpersonal contact at the population-level by using anonymized mobile device geolocation data. We computed the frequency of contact (within six feet) between people in Connecticut during February 2020 - January 2021. Then we aggregated counts of contact events by area of residence to obtain an estimate of the total intensity of interpersonal contact experienced by residents of each town for each day. When incorporated into a susceptible-exposed-infective-removed (SEIR) model of COVID-19 transmission, the contact rate accurately predicted COVID-19 cases in Connecticut towns during the timespan. The pattern of contact rate in Connecticut explains the large initial wave of infections during March-April, the subsequent drop in cases during June-August, local outbreaks during August-September, broad statewide resurgence during September-December, and decline in January 2021. Contact rate data can help guide public health messaging campaigns to encourage social distancing and in the allocation of testing resources to detect or prevent emerging local outbreaks more quickly than traditional case investigation.

309,"High household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States: living density, viral load, and disproportionate impact on communities of color","BackgroundFew prospective studies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households have been reported from the United States, where COVID-19 cases are the highest in the world and the pandemic has had disproportionate impact on communities of color.

Methods and FindingsThis is a prospective observational study. Between April-October 2020, the UNC CO-HOST study enrolled 102 COVID-positive persons and 213 of their household members across the Piedmont region of North Carolina, including 45% who identified as Hispanic/Latinx or non-white. Households were enrolled a median of 6 days from onset of symptoms in the index case. Secondary cases within the household were detected either by PCR of a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab on study day 1 and weekly nasal swabs (days 7, 14, 21) thereafter, or based on seroconversion by day 28. After excluding household contacts exposed at the same time as the index case, the secondary attack rate (SAR) among susceptible household contacts was 60% (106/176, 95% CI 53%-67%). The majority of secondary cases were already infected at study enrollment (73/106), while 33 were observed during study follow-up. Despite the potential for continuous exposure and sequential transmission over time, 93% (84/90, 95% CI 86%-97%) of PCR-positive secondary cases were detected within 14 days of symptom onset in the index case, while 83% were detected within 10 days. Index cases with high NP viral load (>10^6 viral copies/ul) at enrollment were more likely to transmit virus to household contacts during the study (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3-18 p=0.02). Furthermore, NP viral load was correlated within families (ICC=0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.60), meaning persons in the same household were more likely to have similar viral loads, suggesting an inoculum effect. High household living density was associated with a higher risk of secondary household transmission (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.3-55) for households with >3 persons occupying <6 rooms (SAR=91%, 95% CI 71-98%). Index cases who self-identified as Hispanic/Latinx or non-white were more likely to experience a high living density and transmit virus to a household member, translating into an SAR in minority households of 70%, versus 52% in white households (p=0.05).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 transmits early and often among household members. Risk for spread and subsequent disease is elevated in high-inoculum households with limited living space. Very high infection rates due to household crowding likely contribute to the increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and morbidity observed among racial and ethnic minorities in the US. Quarantine for 14 days from symptom onset of the first case in the household is appropriate to prevent onward transmission from the household. Ultimately, primary prevention through equitable distribution of effective vaccines is of paramount importance.

AUTHORS SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSO_LIUnderstanding the secondary attack rate and the timing of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households is important to determine the role of household transmission in the larger pandemic and to guide public health policies about quarantine.

The simplicity of the discrete description allows the analytical calculation of useful information to evaluate the epidemic stage and to support decision making. In this regard, it should be pointed out the estimation of the number death cases and the herd immunization point. Numerical simulations show the model capacity to describe Covid-19 dynamics properly representing real data and describing different scenario patterns. Real data of Germany, Italy and Brazil are of concern to verify the model ability to describe Covid-19 dynamics.

313,Specific allelic discrimination of N501Y and other SARS-CoV-2 mutations by ddPCR detects B.1.1.7 lineage in Washington State,"Real-time epidemiological tracking of variants of interest can help limit the spread of more contagious forms of SARS-CoV-2, such as those containing the N501Y mutation. Typically, genetic sequencing is required to be able to track variants of interest in real-time. However, sequencing can take time and may not be accessible in all laboratories. Genotyping by RT-ddPCR offers an alternative to sequencing to rapidly detect variants of concern through discrimination of specific mutations such as N501Y that is associated with increased transmissibility. Here we describe the first cases of the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Washington State by using a combination of RT-PCR, RT-ddPCR, and next-generation sequencing. We screened 1,035 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by our CDC-based laboratory developed assay using ThermoFishers multiplex RT-PCR COVID-19 assay over four weeks from late December 2020 to early January 2021. S gene dropout candidates were subsequently assayed by RT-ddPCR to confirm four mutations within the S gene associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage: a deletion at amino acid (AA) 69-70 (ACATGT), deletion at AA 145, (TTA), N501Y mutation (TAT), and S982A mutation (GCA). All four targets were detected in two specimens, and follow-up sequencing revealed a total of 10 mutations in the S gene and phylogenetic clustering within the B.1.1.7 lineage. As variants of concern become increasingly prevalent, molecular diagnostic tools like RT-ddPCR can be utilized to quickly, accurately, and sensitively distinguish more contagious lineages of SARS-CoV-2.",Garrett A.

314,SARS-CoV-2 Serology Status Detected by Commercialized Platforms Distinguishes Previous Infection and Vaccination Adaptive Immune Responses,"BackgroundThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 110 million individuals and led to 2.5 million deaths worldwide. As more individuals are vaccinated, the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms needs to be evaluated.

MethodsThe ability of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms to detect previous infection or vaccination were evaluated using a cohort of 53 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, 89 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated healthcare workers (Pfizer or Moderna), and 127 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Serology results were compared to a cell based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) neutralizing antibodies assay.

ResultsThe Roche S-(spike) antibody and Diazyme neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) assays detected adaptive immune response in 100.0% and 90.1% of vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of vaccine (initial and booster), respectively. The Roche N-(nucleocapsid) antibody assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect adaptive immune response in vaccinated individuals. The Diazyme Nabs assay correlated with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 neutralization titers (R2= 0.70), while correlation of the Roche S-antibody assay was weaker (R2= 0.39). Median PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 titers more than doubled in vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of the Moderna vaccine (ID50: 597) compared to individuals that received a single dose (ID50: 284).

ConclusionsThe Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays robustly detected adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The Diazyme NAbs assay strongly correlates with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in vaccinated individuals. Understanding the reactivity of commercially available serology platforms is important when distinguishing vaccination response versus natural infection.

SummaryThe Roche S (spike protein)-antibody and Diazyme neutralizing-antibodies (NAbs) assays were evaluated for their clinical utility in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 related adaptive immune responses by testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed patients, SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated individuals, and SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. Commercial serology results were compared to results generated using a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) NAbs assay and previously validated SARS-CoV-2 commercial serology assays (Roche N (nucleocapsid protein) antibody and Diazyme IgG). We demonstrate that the Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays detected adaptive immune response in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 PSV NAbs. The Roche S-antibody assay had an observed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100% for individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. By contrast, the Roche N assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect vaccine adaptive immune responses.

Repeated evolution of the same mutations, particularly in variants that are now rapidly spreading in various regions of the world, suggests a fitness advantage. Mutations at position P681 in Spike - possibly affecting viral transmission - have also evolved multiple times, including in two variants of concern. Here, we describe three variants circulating in New York State that have independently acquired a P681H mutation and the different trajectories they have taken. While one variant rose to high prevalence since later summer 2020 it appears to be in decline. The other two variants were more recently detected in New York and harbor additional Spike mutations that might be cause for continued monitoring.

317,"Risk, clinical course and outcome of ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a multicenter cohort study","Background and purposeThe frequency of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 varies in the current literature, and risk factors are unknown. We assessed the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

MethodsWe included patients with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in 16 hospitals participating in the international CAPACITY-COVID registry between March 1st and August 1st, 2020. Patients were screened for the occurrence of acute ischemic stroke. We calculated the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke and compared risk factors, cardiovascular complications, and in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ischemic stroke.

ResultsWe included 2147 patients with COVID-19, of whom 586 (27.3%) needed treatment at an intensive care unit (ICU). Thirty-eight patients (1.8%) had an ischemic stroke. Patients with stroke were older, but did not differ in sex or cardiovascular risk factors. Median time between onset of COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of stroke was two weeks. The incidence of ischemic stroke was higher among patients who were treated at an ICU (16/586; 2.7% versus 22/1561; 1.4%; p=0.039). Pulmonary embolism was more common in patients with (8/38; 21.1%) than in those without stroke (160/2109; 7.6%; adjusted RR: 2.08; 95%CI:1.52-2.84). Twenty-seven patients with ischemic stroke (71.1%) died during admission or were functional dependent at discharge and in-hospital mortality. Patients with ischemic stroke were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted RR 1.56; 95%CI:1.13-2.15) than patients without stroke.

ConclusionsIn this multicenter cohort study, the cumulative incidence of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was approximately 2%, with a higher risk in patients treated at an ICU. The majority of stroke patients had a poor outcome.

318,Are vaccines safe in patients with Long COVID? A prospective observational study.,"IntroductionAlthough the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 is well established, there are no published studies on the impact on symptoms in patients with Long Covid. Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals.

MethodsPatients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression.

ResultsForty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache).

When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.

ConclusionsReceipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing.

319,Reducing the Cost of Rapid Antigen Tests through Swab Pooling and Extraction in a Device,"The COVID-19 pandemic places a significant stress on the viral testing capabilities of many countries. The value of rapid point-of-care (PoC) antigen tests is becoming increasingly clear, but implementing frequent large scale testing is costly. We have developed an inexpensive device for pooling swabs, extracting specimens, and detecting viral antigens with a commercial lateral flow assay detecting the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen. The holder of the device can be produced locally through 3D printing. The extraction and the elution can be performed with the entire set-up encapsulated in a transparent bag, minimizing the risk of infection for the operator. With 6 swabs holding approx. 0.1 mL specimen each and 0.35 mL extraction buffer, 43{+/-}6 % (n= 8) of the signal for an individual extraction of a positive control standard was obtained. Image analysis still showed a signal-to-noise ratio of [&ge;] 7 upon further eight-fold dilution. Our current total cost of materials is below $ 2 per tested person or 20% of our cost for an individual PoC test. These findings suggest that pooling can make frequent testing more affordable for schools, universities and other institutions, without decreasing sensitivity to an unacceptable level. Further validation of the method is required.",Tim Berking; Sabrina G Lorenz; Alexander Ulrich; Joachim Greiner; Clemens Richert,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21252969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21252969,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
320,Analysis of Accumulated SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion in North Carolina: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 Community Research Partnership is a population-based longitudinal syndromic and sero-surveillance study. The study includes over 17,000 participants from six healthcare systems in North Carolina who submitted over 49,000 serology results. The purpose of this study is to use these serology data to estimate the cumulative proportion of the North Carolina population that has either been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or developed a measurable humoral response to vaccination.

MethodsAdult community residents were invited to participate in the study between April 2020 and February 2021. Demographic information was collected and daily symptom screen was completed using a secure, HIPPA-compliant, online portal. A portion of participants were mailed kits containing a lateral flow assay to be used in-home to test for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. The cumulative proportion of participants who tested positive at least once during the study was calculated. A standard Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to illustrate the probability of seroconversion over time up to December 20, 2020 (before vaccines available). A separate analysis was performed to describe the influence of vaccines during an extended period through February 15, 2021.

Results17,688 participants contributed at least one serology result. Approximately two-thirds of the population were female and almost three-quarters were between 30 and 64 years of age. The average number of serology test results submitted per participant was 3.0 ({+/-}1.9). At December 20, 2020, the overall probability of seropositivity in the CCRP population was 32.6%. At February 15, 2021 the probability among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers was 83% and 49%, respectively. An inflection upward in the probability of seropositivity was demonstrated around the end of December, suggesting an influence of vaccinations, especially for healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers, those in the oldest age category (60+ years) were 38% less likely to have seroconverted by February 15, 2021.

ConclusionsResults of this study suggest more North Carolina residents may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the number of documented cases as determined by positive RNA or antigen tests. The influence of vaccinations on seropositivity among North Carolina residents is also demonstrated. Additional research is needed to fully characterize the impact of seropositivity on immunity and the ultimate course of the pandemic.",John C Williamson; Thomas F Wierzba; Michele Santacatterina; Iqra Munawar; Austin L Seals; Christine Ann Pittman Ballard; Martha Alexander-Miller; Michael S Runyon; Lewis H McCurdy; Michael A Gibbs; Amina Ahmed; William H Lagarde; Patrick D Maguire; Robin King-Thiele; Terri Hamrick; Abdalla Ihmeidan; Shakira Henderson; Diane Uschner; David M Herrington; John W Sanders,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253226,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253226,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
321,Optimal vaccination strategies for COVID-19 based on dynamical social networks with real-time updating,"Vaccination strategy is crucial in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the supply is limited, contact network-based interventions can be most powerful to set an optimal strategy by identifying high-risk individuals or communities. However, due to the high dimension, only partial and noisy network information can be available in practice, especially for dynamical systems where the contact networks are highly time-variant. Furthermore, numerous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 impact considerably the current infectious probability, requiring real-time network updating algorithms. In this study, we propose a sequential network updating approach based on data assimilation techniques to combine different sources of temporal information. We then prioritise the individuals with high-degree or high-centrality, obtained from the assimilated networks, for vaccination. The assimilation-based approach is compared with the standard method (based on partially observed networks) and a random selection strategy in terms of vaccination effectiveness in a SIR model. The numerical comparison is first carried out using real-world face-to-face dynamical networks collected in a high school, following by sequential multi-layer networks, generated relying on the Barabasi-Albert model emulating the department of Computing at Imperial College London in the UK as an example.",Sibo Cheng; Rossella Arcucci; Christopher Pain; Yike Guo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253356,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253356,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
322,Efficient maternofetal transplacental transfer of anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies after antenatal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy and early infancy can result in severe disease. Evaluating the serologic response after maternal vaccination during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer has important implications for maternal care and vaccination strategies.

ObjectiveTo assess maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after antenatal mRNA vaccination.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study took place at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel in February 2021. Maternal and cord blood sera were collected for antibody measurement from mother/newborn dyads following antenatal vaccination.

ExposureSARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination.

Main outcome and measuresSpike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) - specific, IgG levels were evaluated in maternal and cord blood sera.

ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 20 parturients, with a median maternal age of 32 y ears and a median gestational age of 393/7 weeks at the time of delivery. The median time lapsed from the first and second doses of vaccine administration until delivery was 33 [IQR 30-37] and 11 [IQR 9-15] days, respectively. Of the 20 dyads, all women an d infants were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG levels in maternal sera were positively correlated to their respective concentrations in cord blood ({rho}s= 0.72; P<0.001 and {rho}s= 0.72; P <0.001, respectively). Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG titers in cord blood were directly correlated with time lapsed since the administration of the first vaccine dose ({rho}s= 0.71; P =0.001 and {rho}s= 0.63; P=0.004, respectively).

Conclusion and RelevanceIn this study, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine administered during pregnancy induced adequate maternal serologic response with subsequent efficient transplacental transfer.

323,Evolution of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 over seven months: experience of the Nationwide Seroprevalence ENE-COVID Study in Spain,"ObjectivesTo analyse temporal trends in SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG throughout the four rounds of the nationwide seroepidemiologic study ENE-COVID (April-November 2020), and to compare the fourth-round results of two immunoassays detecting antibodies against nucleocapsid and to S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD).

MethodsA chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) was offered to all participants in the first three rounds (Abbott; anti-nucleocapsid IgG). In the fourth round we offered this test and a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) (Beckman; anti-RBD IgG) to i) a randomly selected sub-cohort, ii) participants who were IgG-positive in any of the three first rounds; and iii) participants who were IgG-positive in the fourth round by point-of-care immunochromatography.

ResultsImmunoassays involving 10,153 participants (82.2% of people invited to donate samples) were performed in the fourth round. A total of 2595 participants (35.1% of participants with immunoassay results in the four rounds) were positive for anti-nucleocapsid IgG in at least one round. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG became undetectable in 43.3% of participants with positive first-round results. Pneumonia was more frequent in participants with anti-nucleocapsid IgG in all four rounds (11.2%) than those in which IgG became undetectable (2.4%).

In fourth round, anti-nucleocapsid and anti-RBD IgG were detected in 5.5% and 5.4% participants of the randomly selected sub-cohort, and in 26.6% and 25.9% participants with at least one previous positive result, respectively. Agreement between techniques was 90.3% (kappa: 0.72).

324,Characterizing the COVID-19 illness experience to inform the study of post-acute sequalae and recovery: a qualitative study,"We aimed to characterize the variability in the illness experience and recovery process from COVID-19. We conducted in-depth individual interviews with participants enrolled in the Long-term Immunological Impact of Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort study in San Francisco, California from June through October of 2020. Participants were adults who had a previously confirmed positive SARV-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result, had recovered or were recovering from acute infection, and underwent serial evaluations at our clinical research center. We purposefully sampled 24 English- and Spanish-speaking adults with asymptomatic, mild and severe symptomatic infection, including those who were hospitalized, and those with HIV co-infection. Half of our sample (50.0%) identified as Latinx/Hispanic and most of the participants were men (62.5%). We used thematic analysis to characterize the illness experience, recovery process, and mental health impact of experiencing COVID-19 and present clinical data for each participant. Emergent themes were: (1) across symptom profiles and severity, experiencing COVID-19 was associated with psychological distress, (2) among participants with symptomatic infection, the illness experience was characterized by uncertainty in terms of managing symptoms and recovery, and (3) despite wide-ranging illness experiences, participants shared many common characteristics, including health information-seeking behavior facilitated by access to medical care, and uncertainty regarding the course of their illness and recovery. COVID-19 was associated with elevated levels of psychological distress, regardless of symptoms.",Edda I. Santiago-Rodriguez; Andres Maiorana; Michael J Peluso; Rebecca Hoh; Viva Tai; Emily A.

325,Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients in outbreak on a cruise ship,"BackgroundA few studies on antibody testing have focused on asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with low initial anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-testing performance was evaluated using blood samples from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples were collected from 143 COVID-19 patients during an outbreak on a cruise ship 3 weeks after diagnosis. Simultaneously, a second SARS-CoV-2 genetic test was performed. Samples stored before the COVID-19 pandemic were also used to evaluate the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare false-negative- with positive-result samples.

ResultsSensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive values of LFA-detected IgM antibodies were 0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.613, respectively; those of LFA-detected IgG antibodies were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972, and 0.601, respectively; and those of ECLIA-detected total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.848, respectively. IgM-, IgG-, and total-antibody positivity rates in the patients with negative results from the second genetic testing were 22.9%, 47.6%, and 72.4%, respectively. All antibody titers, especially those of the IgG antibody against nucleocapsid protein, were significantly lower in blood samples with false-negative results than in those with positive results.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has lower performance in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients than required in the guidelines, and situations in which it is useful are limited.

In this study we identified 690,000 patients infected with COVID-19 with commercial health insurance coverage across the country between April 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020. From prior health care claims, we determined each persons pre-existing diseases among 26 common chronic diseases.

Although there are substantial differences in the age and sex dependency of COVID-19 mortality between countries, there are some common features: Exponential increase with age is a good model to describe and analyse both COVID-19 and all-cause mortality above an age of 40 years, where almost all COVID-19 death occur. Age dependency is stronger for COVID-19 mortality than for all-cause mortality, males have an excess risk compared to women which flattens off with increasing age.

329,"Clinical presentation, disease course and outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with and without pre-existing cardiac disease: a cohort study across sixteen countries","AimsPatients with cardiac disease are considered high risk for poor outcomes following hospitalization with COVID-19. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate heterogeneity in associations between various heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality.

Method and resultsWe used data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry and LEOSS study. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between different types of pre-existent heart disease and in-hospital mortality. 10,481 patients with COVID-19 were included (22.4% aged 66 - 75 years; 38.7% female) of which 30.5% had a history of cardiac disease. Patients with heart disease were older, predominantly male and more likely to have other comorbid conditions when compared to those without. COVID-19 symptoms at presentation did not differ between these groups. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease (30.3%; n=968 versus 15.7%; n=1143). However, following multivariable adjustment this difference was not significant (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.06 [95% CI 0.98 - 1.15, p-value 0.13]). Associations with in-hospital mortality by heart disease subtypes differed considerably, with the strongest association for NYHA III/IV heart failure (aRR 1.43 [95% CI 1.22 - 1.68, p-value <0.001]) and atrial fibrillation (aRR 1.14 [95% CI 1.04 - 1.24, p-value 0.01]). None of the other heart disease subtypes, including ischemic heart disease, remained significant after multivariable adjustment.

ConclusionThere is considerable heterogeneity in the strength of association between heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality.

331,Oxygen provision to severely ill COVID-19 patients at the peak of the 2020 pandemic in a Swedish district hospital: medical records-based cohort study,"Oxygen therapy is a low-cost and life-saving therapy for patients with COVID-19. Yet, it is a limited resource in many hospitals in low income countries and in the 2020 pandemic even hospitals in richer countries reported oxygen shortages. An accurate understanding of oxygen requirements is needed for capacity planning. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the average flow-rate of oxygen to severe COVID-19-patients to be 10 l/min. However, there is a lack of empirical hospital-based data about the oxygen provision to patients. This study aimed to estimate the oxygen provision to COVID-19 patients with severe disease in a Swedish district hospital.

A retrospective, medical records-based cohort study was conducted in March to May 2020 in a Swedish district hospital. All adult patients with severe COVID-19 - those who received oxygen in the ward and had no ICU-admission during their hospital stay - were included. Data were collected on the oxygen flow-rates provided to the patients throughout their stay in hospital, and summary measures of oxygen provision calculated.

One-hundred and twenty six patients were included. Their median age was 70 years and 43% were female. On admission, 27% had a peripheral oxygen saturation of [&le;]91% and 54% had a respiratory rate of [&ge;]25/min. The mean oxygen flow-rate to patients while receiving oxygen therapy was 3.0 l/min (SD 2.9) and the mean total volume of oxygen provided per patient admission was 16,000 l (SD 23,000).

In conclusion, the provision of oxygen to severely ill COVID-19-patients was lower than previously estimated. Further research is required before global estimates are adjusted.

332,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cincinnati Ohio USA from August to December 2020,"The world is currently in a pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) caused by a novel positive-sense, single-stranded RNA {beta}-coronavirus referred to as SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately, most infected individuals recover and are then resistant to re-infection for a period, indicating that a vaccination approach can be successful. Elucidation of rates of past SARS-CoV-2 infection within select regions across the United States of America (USA) will help direct vaccination efforts and together will inform our approach towards achieving herd immunity. Here we investigated rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, USA metropolitan area from August to December 2020, just prior to initiation of the national vaccination program. Examination of 9,550 adult blood donor volunteers for serum IgG antibody positivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein showed an overall prevalence of 8.40%, measured as 7.56% in the first 58 days of this time frame, versus a significant increase to 9.24% in the last 58 days, and a final rate of 12.86% in December 2020. Approximately 56% of Spike seropositive individuals also had immunoreactivity against the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the Spike protein, which is associated with viral neutralization. Males and females in the Cincinnati area showed nearly identical rates of past infection, and rates among Hispanics, African Americans and Caucasians were not significantly different. Interestingly, donors under 30 years of age had the highest rates of past infection, while those over 60 had the lowest. Geographic analysis showed that the West side of Cincinnati had a rate of 9.63% versus 8.13% on the East side (demarcated by Interstate-75), while the adjoining area of Kentucky was 7.04% (as demarcated by the Ohio River).

333,Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 and Mitigation Using Box Fan Air Cleaners in a Poorly Ventilated Classroom,"Many indoor places, including aged classrooms and offices, prisons, homeless shelters, etc., are poorly ventilated but resource-limited to afford expensive ventilation upgrade or commercial air purification systems, raising concerns on the safety of opening activities in these places in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation. Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space. The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient. However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards. In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone. The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain its efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient associated with human thermal plume and hot ventilation air during cold seasons. Overall, our study shows that box fan air cleaners can serve as an effective low-cost alternative for mitigating airborne transmission risks in poorly ventilated spaces.",Ruichen He; Wanjiao Liu; John Elson; Rainer Vogt; Clay Maranville; Jiarong Hong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253395,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253395,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
334,Acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among health care workers in Ghana,"The acceptance or otherwise of the COVID-19 vaccine by health care workers can influence the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among the general population as they are a reliable source of health information. In this study, we sought to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among health care workers in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected data from 234 health care workers through a self-administered online survey from 16 January to 15 February 2021. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses using binary logistic regression were performed using STATA version 15. The results showed that 39.3% of health care workers had the intention of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors such as sex, category of health care workers, relative being diagnosed with COVID-19, and trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government in the fight against COVID-19 proved to be significant predictors of the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns about the safety of vaccines and the adverse side effects of the vaccine were identified as the main reasons why health care workers would decline uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. The self-reported low intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana requires the urgent call of the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders to critically address health care workers concerns about the safety and adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as this would increase vaccine uptake. Interventions must also take into consideration sex and the category of health care workers to achieve the desired results.",Martin Wiredu Agyekum; Grace Frempong Afrifa-Anane; Frank Kyei-Arthur; Bright Addo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253374,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253374,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
335,COVID-19 and Medical Education in Ghana: Assessing the Impact,"Medical education in Ghana has been affected in many ways by the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the pandemic has affected both preclinical and clinical segments of medical education, the effect has been felt more at the clinical stage. Medical students on vacation who started their clinical training abroad could not return to their destination of study to complete their programme because of COVID-19 linked travel restrictions. This qualitative study examined how COVID-19 impacted on teaching and learning at a public higher education institution offering clinical medical education in Ghana for over 200 medical students. These medical students were from three different higher education institutions with varied curriculum outcomes. Thus, for them to be considered as a single group required innovativeness on the part of administrators. Open-ended interviews were held with administrators and the outcome indicated that salient aspects of the clinical training process had been impacted. These included administration of clinical education, curriculum, student learning, student assessment and code of practice. As a result of the pandemic, student learning shifted from traditional face to face interaction to online learning at the beginning. Some of the administrative challenges that ensued included the need for reduced number of students per tutor and introduction of afternoon sessions with a limited budget. The paper concludes that COVID-19 has been disruptive to traditional medical education in Ghana. However, the novel learning processes may provide opportunities to increase access to medical education using a phased system of learning. The findings from this study should have implications for policy and contribute to the discourse on blended learning in medical education in Ghana while ensuring that quality is maintained in all instances.",Edward Asumanu; Linda Tsevi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253306,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253306,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
336,Automated Production of Research Data Marts from a Canonical Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Data Repository: Applications to COVID-19 Research,"ObjectiveObjective: The COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the need for timely real-world data (RWD) for research. To meet this need, several large clinical consortia have developed networks for access to RWD from electronic health records (EHR), each with its own common data model (CDM) and custom pipeline for extraction, transformation, and load operations for production and incremental updating. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely RWD (e.g., 2-week delay) make this less feasible.

Methods and MaterialsWe describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical model for representation of clinical data for automated transformation to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs and the near automated production of linked clinical data repositories (CDRs) for COVID-19 research using the FHIR subscription standard. The approach was applied to healthcare data from a large academic institution and was evaluated using published quality assessment tools.

ResultsSix years of data (1.07M patients, 10.1M encounters, 137M laboratory results), were loaded into the FHIR CDR producing 3 linked real-time linked repositories: FHIR, PCORnet, and OMOP. PCORnet and OMOP databases were refined in subsequent post processing steps into production releases and met published quality standards. The approach greatly reduced CDM production efforts.

ConclusionsFHIR and FHIR CDRs can play an important role in enhancing the availability of RWD from EHR systems. The above approach leverages 21st Century Cures Act mandated standards and could greatly enhance the availability of datasets for research.",Leslie A Lenert; Adnrey V.

337,A rapid review of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization in the U.S.: alignment between Federal guidance and State practice,"BackgroundPopulation groups to be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. have been determined at the Federal level. Evidence suggests that there is variation in how States have implemented this guidance. This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice.

MethodsAn online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group.

ResultsHealthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Of the 37 States including frontline essential workers, 12 assigned them to a lower priority than recommended. Almost all States included the 65-74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by many States.

ConclusionsAcross the U.S, the prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable. Essential workers were the most often excluded or less highly prioritised group compared to Federal guidance. Some socially vulnerable groups were highly prioritized in State plans, whilst others were mentioned in only a few States. Future guidance must be relevant to local needs and values, to minimise any unwarranted heterogeneity in vaccine access across populations.",Vageesh Jain; Lara Schwarz; Paula Lorgelly,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253411,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
338,Immunodominant B cell epitope in SARS-CoV-2 RBD comprises a B.1.351 and P.1 mutation hotspot: implications for viral spread and antibody escape,"Recent SARS-CoV-2 variants pose important concerns due to their higher transmissibility (1) and escape (2) from previous infections or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (nAb). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein is a major nAb target (3), but data on its B cell epitopes are still lacking. Using a peptide microarray, we identified an immunodominant epitope (S415-429) recognized by 68% of sera from 71 convalescent Brazilians infected with the ancestral variant. In contrast with previous studies, we have identified a linear IgG and IgA antibody binding epitope within the RBD. IgG and IgA antibody levels for this epitope positively correlated with nAb titers, suggesting a potential target of antibody neutralizing activity. Interestingly, this immunodominant RBD region harbors the mutation hotspot site K417 present in P.1 (K417T) and B.1.351 (K417N) variants. In silico simulation analyses indicate impaired RBD binding to nAb in both variants and that a glycosylation in the B.1.351 417N could further hinder antibody binding as compared to the K417T mutation in P.1. This is in line with published data showing that nAb from either convalescents or anti-CoV-2 vaccinees are less effective towards B.1.351 than for P.1. Our data support the occurrence of immune pressure and selection involving this immunodominant epitope that may have critically contributed to the recent COVID-19 marked rise in Brazil and South Africa, and pinpoint a potential additional immune escape mechanism for SARS-CoV-2.",Keity Souza Santos; Jamille R Oliveira; Rafael RG Machado; Jhosiene Y Magawa; Isabela P Daher; Alysson H Urbanski; Gabriela JH Schmitz; Roberto Carlos V Silva Jr.; Edison L Durigon; Silvia B Boscardin; Daniela S Rosa; Deborah Schechtman; Helder I Nakaya; Edecio Cunha-Neto; Gabriele Gadermaier; Veronica Coelho; Jorge Kalil,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253399,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253399,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

Using a direct RT-PCR method with the Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene), the clinical sensitivity of the gargle was 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2 to 98.3%) and was similar to the sensitivity of the ONPS (93.8%; 95% CI, 88.2 to 97.3%), despite significantly lower viral RNA concentration in gargles, as reflected by higher cycle threshold values. No single specimen type detected all COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable in gargles at room temperature for at least 7 days.

340,Using translational in vitro-in vivo modeling to improve drug repurposing outcomes for inhaled COVID-19 therapeutics,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for antiviral treatments that can be deployed rapidly. Drug repurposing represents a promising means of achieving this objective, but repurposing efforts are often unsuccessful. A common hurdle to effective drug repurposing is a failure to achieve a sufficient therapeutic window in the new indication. A clear example is the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, where the approved dose (administered orally) fails to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lungs. Our proposed solution to the problem of ineffective drug repurposing for COVID-19 antivirals is two-fold: to broaden the therapeutic window by reformulating therapeutics for the pulmonary route, and to select drug repurposing candidates based on their model-predicted therapeutic index for inhalation. In this article, we propose a two-stage model-driven screening and validation process for selecting inhaled antiviral drug repurposing candidates. While we have applied this approach in the specific context of COVID-19, this in vitro-in vivo translational methodology is also broadly applicable to repurposing drugs for diseases of the lower respiratory tract.",Madison Stoddard; Lin Yuan; Arijit Chakravarty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253375,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253375,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

The nature of protection shown by direct contacts of COVID-19 positive patients is quite intriguing to note. We aimed to study the immune differences reinforcing contact individuals in circumventing the disease. Our observation showed direct contacts of PCR positive patients developed elevated neutralizing antibody titres and cytokine levels. On the other hand, single cell data revealed differential usage of V(D)J genes and unique BCR clonotypes imparting protective immune signatures.

342,An observational cohort study on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and B.1.1.7 variant infection in healthcare workers by antibody and vaccination status,"BackgroundNatural and vaccine-induced immunity will play a key role in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 variants have the potential to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity.

MethodsIn a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing.

Results13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7.

ConclusionNatural infection resulting in detectable anti-spike antibodies and two vaccine doses both provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including against the B.1.1.7 variant.

343,Recovered not restored: Long-term health consequences after mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients,"BackgroundWhile the leading symptoms during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are acute and the majority of patients fully recover, a significant fraction of patients now increasingly experience long-term health consequences. However, most data available focus on health-related events after severe infection and hospitalization. We present a longitudinal, prospective analysis of health consequences in patients who initially presented with no or minor symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hence we focus on mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients.

MethodsWe included 958 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in this study. Patients were observed for seven months from April 6th to December 2nd 2020 for long-term symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We identified anosmia, ageusia, fatigue or shortness of breath as most common, persisting symptoms at month 4 and 7 and summarized presence of such long-term health consequences as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Predictors of long-term symptoms were assessed using an uni- and multivariable logistic regression model.

FindingsWe observed 442 and 353 patients over four and seven months after symptom onset, respectively. Four months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8.6% (38/442) of patients presented with shortness of breath, 12.4% (55/442) with anosmia, 11.1% (49/442) with ageusia and 9.7% (43/442) with fatigue. At least one of these characteristic symptoms was present in 27.8% (123/442) and 34.8% (123/353) at month 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. This corresponds to 12.8% patients with long-lasting symptoms relative to the initial total cohort (123/958). A lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk to develop long-term symptoms.

InterpretationThe on-going presence of either shortness of breath, anosmia, ageusia or fatigue as long-lasting symptoms even in non-hospitalized patients was observed at four and seven months post-infection and summarized as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). The continued assessment of patients with PCS will become a major task to define and mitigate the socioeconomic and medical long-term effects of COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSData about long-term health consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 is scarce and most available data describe health consequences in hospitalized patients during acute COVID-19. However, these studies do not take into account the vast majority of patients with a milder course of infection (WHO score1-3).

Added value of this studyOur cohort consists of mostly mild COVID-19 cases that have been prospectively followed for a median time of 6.8 months. At least one trained physician critically reviewed the patients reported symptoms at each visit. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG at each visit to correlate reported symptoms with serological data. At 4 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, shortness of breath occurred in 8.6% (38/442), anosmia in 12.4% (55/442), ageusia in 11.1% (49/442), and fatigue in 9.7% (43/442) of patients. At least one characteristic symptom was present in 27.8% (123/442) and 34.8% (123/353) at months 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. Symptoms were summarized as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Relative to our initial total cohort (123/958), this corresponds to 12.8% patients with long-lasting symptoms. Lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk of developing long-term symptoms.

Implications of all available evidenceWe believe that our findings have important implications for the fields of infectious diseases and public health, because we show long-term health consequences may occur even after very mild COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. As up to 81% of all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients present with mild disease, it can be expected that PCS will affect a larger number of individuals than initially assumed, posing major medical, social and economic challenges.",Max Augustin; Philipp Schommers; Melanie Stecher; Felix Dewald; Lutz Gieselmann; Henning Gruell; Carola Horn; Kanika Vanshylla; Veronica Di Cristianziano; Luise Osebold; Maria Roventa; Toqeer Riaz; Nikolai Tschernoster; Janine Altmueller; Leonard Rose; Susanne Salomon; Vanessa Priesner; Jan Christoffer Luers; Christian Albus; Stephan Rosenkranz; Birgit Gathof; Gerd Faetkenheuer; Michael Hallek; Florian Klein; Isabelle Suarez; Clara Lehmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253207,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253207,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
344,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection in Saliva by real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF Methods,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the need for rapid implementation of diagnostic assays for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens. While multiple molecular methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, supply chain constraints and need for easier and safer specimen collection warrant alternative specimen types, particularly saliva. Although saliva has been found to be a comparable clinical matrix for detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of diagnostic and analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we compared two methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva: the Roche cobas(R) 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test and the Agena Biosciences MassARRAY(R) SARS-CoV-2 Panel/MassARRAY(R) System. Overall, both systems had high agreement with one another, and both demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of each platform and determined the limit of detection of the Roche assay was four times lower than that of Agena for saliva specimens (390.6 v. 1,562.5 copies/mL). Furthermore, across individual target components of each assay, T2 and N2 targets had the lowest limits of detection for each platform, respectively. Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection in two technologies that have high agreement and differ in analytical sensitivities overall and across individual component targets. The addition of saliva as an acceptable specimen and understanding the sensitivity for testing on these platforms can further inform public health measures for screening and detection to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",Matthew M.

In a second approach, potential aerosol spread during chest compression was visualized.

ResultsThere was no significant difference between manual and leg-heel compression. The distance to potential aerosol spread could have been increased by leg-heel method.

346,"Comparing COVID-19 risk factors in Brazil using machine learning: the importance of socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on Brazil. Brazils social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities and persisting political disarray. This complex scenario motivates careful study of the clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors contributing to increased risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil specifically.

MethodsWe consider the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe catalog, a very rich respiratory infection dataset which allows us to estimate the importance of several non-laboratorial and socio-geographic factors on COVID-19 mortality. We analyze the catalog using machine learning algorithms to account for likely complex interdependence between metrics.

FindingsThe XGBoost algorithm achieved excellent performance, producing an AUC-ROC of 0.813 (95%CI 0.810-0.817), and outperforming logistic regression. Using our model we found that, in Brazil, socioeconomic, geographical and structural factors are more important than individual comorbidities. Particularly important factors were: The state of residence and its development index; the distance to the hospital (especially for rural and less developed areas); the level of education; hospital funding model and strain. Ethnicity is also confirmed to be more important than comorbidities but less than the aforementioned factors.

InterpretationSocioeconomic and structural factors are as important as biological factors in determining the outcome of COVID-19. This has important consequences for policy making, especially on vaccination/non-pharmacological preventative measures, hospital management and healthcare network organization.

ResultsEuropean countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID-19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean greater than 50, relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068 - 4.347, p-value = 0.032). A statistically significant negative moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean and the number of COVID-19 deaths for each 14-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic time period.

ConclusionsThe observation of the significantly lower COVID-19 mortality rates in countries with lowest annual sun exposure but highest mean Vitamin-D (25)-HD levels provides support for more awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy due to emergence of large number of COVID-19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these observations.

Strengths of this studyLarge number of different European populations studied with different policies of food fortification and different population Vitamin D levels

Ten months of longitudinal study during rise and fall and rise again of the epidemic

Limitations of this studyBased on population Vitamin D levels published before the beginning of the pandemic. Though there hasnt been a pan-European national/international health education initiative about Vitamin D and COVID-19 infection, it has been well covered in the media and could have resulted in changes, though probably minor, at the national level.

348,Quantifying Contact Patterns in Response to COVID-19 Public Health Measures in Canada,"BackgroundA variety of public health measures have been implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada to reduce contact between individuals.

ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to construct contact patterns to evaluate the degree to which social contacts rebounded to normal levels, as well as direct public health efforts toward age- and location-specific settings.

DesignFour population-based cross-sectional surveys.

SettingCanada.

ParticipantsMembers of a paid panel representative of Canadian adults by age, gender, official language, and region of residence.

MethodsRespondents provided information about the age and setting for each direct contact made in a 24-hour period. Contact matrices were constructed and contacts for those under the age of 18 years imputed. The next generation matrix approach was used to estimate the reproduction number (Rt) for each survey. Respondents with children estimated the number of contacts their children made in school and extracurricular settings.

ResultsEstimated Rt values were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.69) for May, 0.48 (95% CI: 0.29-0.68) for July, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.63-1.52) for September, and 0.81 (0.47-1.17) for December. The highest proportion of reported contacts occurred within the home (51.3% in May), in  other locations (49.2% in July) and at work (66.3% and 65.4% in September and December). Respondents with children reported an average of 22.7 (95% CI: 21.1-24.3) (September) and 19.0 (95% CI 17.7-20.4) (December) contacts at school per day per child in attendance.

ConclusionThe skewed distribution of reported contacts toward workplace settings in September and December combined with the number of reported school-related contacts suggest that these settings represent important opportunities for transmission emphasizing the need to ensure infection control procedures in both workplaces and schools.",Gabrielle Brankston; Eric Merkley; David N Fisman; Ashleigh R Tuite; Zvonimir Poljak; Peter J Loewen; Amy L Greer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253301,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253301,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
349,Comprehensive evaluation of the impact of sociodemographic inequalities on adverse outcomes and excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City has been sharp, as several social inequalities coexist with chronic comorbidities. Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of social, municipal, and individual factors on the COVID-19 pandemic in working-age population living in Mexico City. To this end, we used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System; furthermore, we used a multidimensional metric, the social lag index (DISLI), to evaluate its interaction with mean urban population density (MUPD) and its impact on COVID-19 rates. Influence DISLI and MUPD on the effect of vehicular mobility policies on COVID-19 rates were also tested. Finally, we assessed the influence of MUPD and DISLI on discrepancies of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality compared with death certificates from the General Civil Registry. We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically active sectors and who experienced increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The impact of social inequalities transcends individuals and has significant effects at a municipality level, with and interaction between DISLI and MUPD. Marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced an accentuated risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts across marginalized municipalities. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths and significant excess mortality associated with non-COVID-19 deaths closely related to MUPD/DISLI in an ambulatory setting, which could be a negative externality of hospital reconversion. In conclusion, social, individual, and municipality-wide factors played a significant role in shaping the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City.",Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa; Luisa Fernández-Chirino; Julio Pisanty-Alatorre; Javier Mancilla-Galindo; Ashuin Kammar-García; Arsenio Vargas-Vázquez; Armando González-Díaz; Carlos A.

350,Dynamic versus Continuous Interventions: Optimizing Lockdown Policies for COVID-19,"In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while millions of people await the administration of a vaccine, social distancing remains the leading approach towards the effect commonly known as ""flattening the curve"" of infections. Over the last year, governmental administrations throughout the globe have implemented various lockdown policies in hopes of slowing down the transmission of the disease. However, the current lack of consensus on when and how these policies should be implemented reflects the need for further studies regarding these questions. In this paper, we tackle the issue of lockdown policy management, in particular in terms of lockdown placement (how often, when, and how long these periods should be), in order to minimize the peak of infections in a specific population. We introduce a novel combination of classic mathematical disease modelling using the equation-based SEIR model, and Evolutionary Strategies (ES) for optimizing the peak of infections. The method is evaluated using data collected in different countries, and a particular focus is placed on the study of the effect of specific model parameters on lockdown optimization, such as the transmission rate ({beta}), of which 4 alternative modelling functions have been proposed and analyzed. Our results indicate that this transmission rate parameter significantly influences the resulting optimal strategies. In particular, the presence of a gradual decay of the rate of transmission during lockdown leads to longer, more sparsely placed confinement periods while an abrupt, instantaneous drop in the amount of contacts per person favors shorter but more frequent lockdowns. Although these results are limited by the scope of action provided by the simplicity of the SEIR model, they suggest that the influence of the evolution of the rate of transmission along the disease should be assessed in further studies with alternative optimization strategies (agent-based) and models (SEIRSHUD).",Kaan Akinci; Javier Fdez; Elena Pena-Tapia; Olaf Witkowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253324,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253324,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
351,Analysis of severe outcomes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England using ICNARC Case Mix Programme and QResearch databases.,"BackgroundA new, more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in the UK. We estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in critical ill patients, and overall mortality associated with VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant. We also compare clinical outcomes between these variants   groups.

MethodsWe linked a large primary care (QResearch), the national critical care (ICNARC CMP) and the COVID-19 testing (PHE) database and extracted two cohorts. The first was used to explore the association between VOC B.1.1.7 and critical care admission and 28-day mortality. The second to determine the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with VOC B.1.1.7 compared to those without. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, region, other socio-demographics and comorbidities (asthma, COPD, type I and II, hypertension). We reported information on types and duration of organ supports for the two variants   groups.

FindingsThe first cohort included 198,420 patients. Of these, 80,494 had VOC B.1.1.7, 712 were critically ill and 630 died by 28 days. The second cohort included 3432 critically ill patients. Of these, 2019 had VOC B.1.1.7 and 822 died at the end of critical care. Using the first cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios for critical care admission and mortality to be 1.99 (95% CI: 1.59, 2.49) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.25-2.03) for VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant group, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in critical care, estimated using the second cohort, was 0.93 (95% CI 0.76-1.15) for patients with VOC B.1.1.7, compared to those without.

InterpretationVOC B.1.1.7 appears to be more severe. Patients with VOC B.1.1.7 are at increased risk of critical care admission and mortality compared with patients without. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appears independent of virus strain.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01, or lineage B.1.1.7, was detected in England in September 2020. The characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with VOC B.1.1.7 are not yet known. VOC B.1.1.7 has been associated with increased transmissibility. Early analyses have suggested infection with VOC B.1.1.7 may be associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with infection with other virus variants, but these analyses had either limited ability to adjust for key confounding variables or did not consider critical care admission. The effects of VOC B.1.1.7 on severe COVID-19 outcomes remain unclear.

Added value of this studyThis study found a 60% higher risk of 28-day mortality associated with infection with VOC B.1.1.7 in patients tested in the community in comparison with the original variant, when adjusted for key confounding variables. The risk of critical care admission for those with VOC B.1.1.7 is double the risk associated with the original variant. For patients receiving critical care, the infecting variant is not associated with the risk of mortality at the end of critical care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe higher mortality and rate of critical care admission associated with VOC B.1.1.7, combined with its known increased transmissibility, are likely to put health care systems under further stress.

To address this gap, we developed models that first incorporate the role of heterogeneity and connectivity and then can be expanded to make assumptions about demographic characteristics. Results demonstrate that variations in the number of connections of individuals within a population modify the impact of public health interventions such vaccination approaches.

353,"Effect of natural mutations of SARS-CoV-2 on spike structure, conformation and antigenicity","New SARS-CoV-2 variants that have accumulated multiple mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein enable increased transmission and resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Here, we study the antigenic and structural impacts of the S protein mutations from four variants, one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and three that rapidly spread in human populations and originated in the United Kingdom, Brazil or South Africa. All variants either retained or improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Brazil) spike variants showed reduced binding to neutralizing NTD and RBD antibodies, respectively, while the B.1.351 (SA) variant showed reduced binding to both NTD- and RBD-directed antibodies. Cryo-EM structural analyses revealed allosteric effects of the mutations on spike conformations and revealed mechanistic differences that either drive inter-species transmission or promotes viral escape from dominant neutralizing epitopes.

354,"Prediction of severe COVID-19 cases requiring a ventilator in Tokyo, Japan","BackgroundTo avoid exhaustion of medical resources by COVID-19, policy-makers must predict care needs, specifically the proportion of severe cases likely to need ventilator care.

ObjectiveThis study was designed to use a statistical model to elucidate dynamics of severe cases in Tokyo and to discuss the timing of effective policy activation.

MethodsThe study extended from April 27 through October 18, 2020 in Japans Tokyo Metropolitan area. Medical exhaustion was defined as use of more than half of the ventilator capacity available before the COVID-19 outbreak. We regressed the number of severe cases on the newly onset patients of more than 14 days prior. As earlier research indicated, the COVID-19 severity changed at the end of May. Therefore, we added dummy variables to reflect changing severity from June and its product with newly onset patients as the explanatory variable. Then we calculated the threshold using R(t): R(t)=0.99 for the number of patients 14 days prior was used as a threshold at which strong countermeasures should be activated to keep to avoid medical exhaustion.

ResultsThe critical number signaling medical exhaustion in Tokyo was defined as 655 cases. We selected 15, 30, 60 and 90 days prior as explanatory variables for explaining the number of severe cases. A coefficient of determination larger than 0.95 was inferred as indicating good fit. The threshold was estimated as more than 4500 cases for R(t)=1.1 and monotonically decreasing by R(t) to be 600 cases for R(t)=2.5.

Discussion and ConclusionResults showed that newly onset patients reported more than 14 days prior can explain the number of severe cases very well. We also confirmed the threshold number of patients 14 days prior by R(t) for which strong countermeasures should be activated to avoid medical exhaustion with R(t)=0.99.

355,Google Trends as a method to predict new COVID-19 cases,"In this paper, we develop a method that can detect and predict the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 at an early stage. With this method, we try to lay the empirical basis for the development of the model of digital monitoring and prediction of the occurrence of new cases of COVID-19 in Croatia, relying on the analytical tool Google Trends (GT).

ResultsIn Croatia search activities using GT for terms such as   PCR +Covid"", ""PCR + test"", and symptoms ""cough + corona"", ""pneumonia + corona""; ""muscle pain + corona"" correlate strongly with officially reported cases of the disease. Google Trends tools are suitable for predicting the emergence of new COVID-19 cases in Croatia, and that the data collected by this method correlate with official data.

The benefit of this method is reliable estimates that can enable public health officials to prepare and better respond to the possible return of a pandemic in certain parts of the country. If a region experiences an early, sharp increase in Covid-19-like-illness Google searches, it may be possible to focus additional resources on that region to identify the etiology of the outbreak, providing extra medical capacity or raising local media awareness as necessary.

Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with Covid-19 symptoms, this method can serve as an early alarm to predict the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 in the specific area in Croatia.",Tado Juric,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253452,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253452,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
356,Negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR or rapid antigen test result and the subsequent risk of being infectious: a mathematical simulation study,"BackgroundA considerable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Therefore, different polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or rapid antigen test (RAT)-based approaches are being discussed and applied to identify infectious cases that would have gone undetected (e.g., in nursing homes). In this article, we provide a framework to estimate the time-dependent risk of being infectious after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test and we simulate the number of expected cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested negative.

MethodsA Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate infections that occurred over a one-week period in populations with 1,000 individuals following a negative SARS-Cov-2 test. Parameters representing the application of PCR tests or RATs are utilized, and SARS-CoV-2 7-day incidences between 25 and 200 per 100,000 people are considered. Simulation results are compared to case numbers predicted via a mathematical equation.

ResultsThe simulations showed a linear increase in cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. The different false negative rates of PCR tests and RATs have a strong impact on the number of simulated cases. The simulated and the mathematically predicted case numbers were comparable. However, Monte Carlo simulations highlight that, due to random effects, infectious cases can exceed predicted case numbers even shortly after a test was conducted.

ConclusionsThe analysis demonstrates that the number of infectious cases in a population can be effectively reduced by the screening of asymptomatic individuals. However, the time since the negative test and the underlying SARS-CoV-2 incidence are critical parameters in determining the observed subsequent number of cases in tested populations.",Ralf Krumkamp; Benno Kreuels; Veronika K Jaeger; Juergen May; Rafael Mikolajczyk; Andre Karch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253440,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253440,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemy, it is necessary to quantify the neutralizing antibodies induction by vaccination, since they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, have been minimized in term of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays.

These particles are generated when infected persons exhale and they spread throughout the room, resulting in a high concentration and thus a high risk of infection of non-infected persons. One way to reduce the concentration of particles is to filter them using mobile room air cleaners, which can be easily set up and reduce the concentration of viruses or keep them at a low level. Since many studies are conducted in generic rooms, the question of the cleaning performance of such room air cleaners in real rooms arises. In order to investigate this, measurements of the effectiveness were carried out in a total of 4 different rooms of the ""Obermenzinger Gymnasium"" (Obermenzinger high school) in Munich.

MethodsThe target population was all Iranian people aged six years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28,314 subjects from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias, and sampling design.

ResultsOf the 28,314 Iranians selected, 11,256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male, and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until August 20, 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 13.3%, 15.2%), which was equal to 11,958,346 (95% confidence interval: 11,211,011-12,746,776) individuals.

We aimed to (1) quantify the attack rate of Sars-CoV-2 during outbreaks in reception and accommodation centres in Germany, (2) assess differences in the attack rate based on containment measures, and (3) provide an overview of testing strategies, communication, conflicts, and protection measures for refugees with special needs.

MethodsSystematic web-based review of outbreak media reports (until June 2020) on confirmed Sars-CoV-2 cases in reception centers for asylum seekers in Germany using the google search engine. Reports were screened for pre-defined inclusion criteria and complemented by snowball searches. Data on facility name, location, confirmed cases, containment measures, communication, protection strategies, and conflicts was extracted for each outbreak and reporting date. Evidence synthesis: meta-analysis and negative binomial regression.

FindingsWe identified 337 media reports on 101 Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks in 99 reception and accommodation centers in Germany. The pooled Sars-CoV-2 attack rate was 13.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 9.8-16.7). Outbreak sites implementing mass quarantine (n=76) showed higher rates (15.7; 95% CI: 11.6 - 20.2) compared to sites using conventional strategies (6.6; 95%CI: 3.1 - 11.2), yielding a rate ratio of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.27-0.72) adjusted for testing strategies, type and size of accommodation. Conflicts occurred in at least 11.8% of all outbreaks. Few sites reported specific measures to protect refugees with special needs.

ConclusionMass quarantine is associated with higher attack rates, and appears to be a counter-productive containment measure in overcrowded camps. Although further research with individual-level data is required to rule out residual confounding, reception centers and refugee camps should follow the available guidelines on Covid-19 response and refrain from mass quarantine if physical distancing cannot be guaranteed.",Rosa Jahn; Maren Hintermeier; Kayvan Bozorgmehr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21249641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21249641,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among undergraduate medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February - 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, hurried testing of vaccines prior to launch and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Risk perception regarding contracting COVID-19 vaccine reduced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitation in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track.

362,"Modelling, prediction and design of national COVID-19 lockdowns by stringency and duration","The implementation of lockdowns has been a key policy to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to keep under control the number of infections. However, quantitatively predicting in advance the effects of lockdowns based on their stringency and duration is a complex task, in turn making it difficult for governments to design effective strategies to stop the disease. Leveraging a novel mathematical ""hybrid"" approach, we propose a new epidemic model that is able to predict the future number of active cases and deaths when lockdowns with different stringency levels or durations are enforced. The key observation is that lockdown-induced modifications of social habits may not be captured by traditional mean-field compartmental models because these models assume uniformity of social interactions among the population, which fails during lockdown. Our model is able to capture the abrupt social habit changes caused by lockdowns. The results are validated on the data of Israel and Germany by predicting past lockdowns and providing predictions in alternative lockdown scenarios (different stringency and duration). The findings show that our model can effectively support the design of lockdown strategies by stringency and duration, and quantitatively forecast the course of the epidemic during lockdown.",Alberto Mellone; Zilong Gong; Giordano Scarciotti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253454,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
363,SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase: a retrospective cohort study,"ObjectiveClinical sequelae have not been well characterized during the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 among adults 18 to 65 years old, and this study sought to fill that gap by evaluating excess risk and relative hazards for developing incident clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase.

DesignRetrospective cohort study including three propensity-matched groups.

SettingThis study merged three data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient lab testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database.

ParticipantsIndividuals 18 to 65 years old with continuous health plan enrollment from January 2019 to date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Three comparator groups were identified and propensity-score matched to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, a historical 2019 comparator group and a historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness (vLRTI).

Main outcome measuresOver 50 clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase (index date + 21 days) were ascertained using ICD-10 codes. Excess risk due to SARS-CoV-2 during the 4 months following the acute phase of illness and hazard ratios with 95% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals were calculated.

ResultsThis study found 14% of adults [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had at least one new clinical sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. When considering risk for specific sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection during the post-acute phase, clinical outcomes including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue were significantly elevated compared to the three propensity-matched comparator groups (2020, 2019, vLRTI). Significant risk differences due to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 when compared to the 2020 comparator group.

ConclusionsOur results confirm excess risk for developing clinical sequelae due to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen among other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults ([&le;]50 years), adults who did not have pre-existing conditions or adults who were not hospitalized due to COVID-19 were still at elevated risk for developing new clinical sequelae. The elevated risk for incident sequelae during the post-acute phase is relevant for healthcare planning.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSmall observational studies and case reports of hospitalized patients have shown some COVID-19 survivors suffer from short- and long-term sequelae. Few studies have characterized the excess risk of clinical sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase among adults [&le;]65 years of age in a large generalizable sample.

What this study addsThis study found 14% of individuals [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had a diagnosis of at least one new sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. Elevated risk for specific clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase of illness was noted across a range of organ systems including cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, respiratory, and mental health complications. The risk for incident sequelae increases with age, pre-existing conditions, and hospitalization for COVID-19; however, even among adults [&le;] 50 years of age and individuals without pre-existing conditions or hospitalization due to COVID-19, risk for some clinical sequelae is still elevated. These results indicate where additional diagnostic follow-up, rehabilitation, and symptom management may be warranted among younger adults with milder infection.",Sarah E Daugherty; Yinglong Guo; Kevin Heath; Micah C Dasmarinas; Karol G Jubilo; Jirapat Samranvedhya; Marc Lipsitch; Ken Cohen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253448,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253448,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
364,Impact of Vaccine Prioritization Strategies on Mitigating COVID-19: An Agent-Based Simulation Study using an Urban Region in the United States,"BackgroundApproval of novel vaccines for COVID-19 has brought hope and expectations, but not without additional challenges. One central challenge is how to appropriately prioritize the use of limited supply of vaccines. This study evaluates various prioritization strategies and the efficacy of the vaccination campaign underway in the U.S.

MethodsThe study develops a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under various social interventions including full and partial closures, isolation and quarantine, use of face mask and contact tracing, and vaccination. The model is populated with demographic and societal data for an urban community in the U.S. with 2.8 million residents as well as viral parameters. The model tracks daily numbers of infected, hospitalized, and deaths for all census age-groups. Model is calibrated using parameters for viral transmission and level of community circulation of individuals. Published data from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard is used to validate the model. Vaccination strategies are compared using hypothesis test for pairwise comparisons.

ResultsThree prioritization strategies examined are: a close variant of the CDC recommendation, an age-stratified strategy, and a random strategy. The impact of vaccination is also contrasted with a no vaccination scenario. The comparison shows that the ongoing campaign in the U.S. using vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is expected to 1) reduce the cumulative number of infection by 10% and 2) help the pandemic to subside below a small threshold of 100 daily new reported cases sooner by approximately a month. The prioritization strategies when compared with each other showed no significant difference in their impacts on pandemic mitigation.

ConclusionsRecent explosive growth of the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to shrink the susceptible population. This, we believe, will likely limit the expected number of people that could be prevented from getting infected due to vaccination. A shrinking susceptible pool may also be an attributable reason for the observed lack of statistical difference among the outcomes of the prioritization strategies. However, the invariance of the strategies should give more latitude for decision makers in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.",Hanisha Anand Tatapudi; Rachita Das; Tapas K Das,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253447,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

367,Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines protect against sarbecovirus challenge in mice,"The emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the 21st century highlights the need to develop universal vaccination strategies against the SARS-related Sarbecovirus subgenus. Using structure-guided chimeric spike designs and multiplexed immunizations, we demonstrate protection against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and bat CoV (BtCoV) RsSHC014 challenge in highly vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike mRNAs containing N-terminal domain (NTD), and receptor binding domains (RBD) induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against three high-risk sarbecoviruses: SARS-CoV, RsSHC014, and WIV-1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a 10 to >500-fold reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous sarbecovirus strains, but SARS-CoV challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infection including measurable lung pathology. Importantly, chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized both the D614G and the South African B.1.351 variants of concern despite some reduction in neutralization activity. Thus, multiplexed-chimeric spikes may provide a novel strategy to prevent pandemic and SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections, while revealing the limited efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccines against other sarbecoviruses.",David R.

368,An Innovative antibody-based Plug-and-Play strategy for SARS-CoV-2,"The novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) remains a public health threat worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 enters human host lung cells via its spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a process critical dependent on host protease-mediated fusion event. Thus, effective targeted therapies blocking the first step of viral fusion and cellular entry remains a critical unmet medical need to overcome disease pathology. Here we engineered and describe an antibody-based novel and targeted plug-and-play strategy, which directly competes with the proteolytic activation function of SAR-CoV-2 spike protein. The described strategy involves the engineering of furin substrate residues in IgG1 Fc-extended flexible region of spike targeting antibody. Our results with spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeting CR3022 antibody support blockade of the viral function using proof of concept ACE2 overexpressing cells.

369,A metal ion orients mRNA to ensure accurate 2'-O ribosyl methylation of the first nucleotide of the SARS-CoV-2 genome,"The SARS-CoV-2 nsp16/nsp10 enzyme complex modifies the 2-OH of the first transcribed nucleotide of the viral mRNA by covalently attaching a methyl group to it. The 2-O methylation of the first nucleotide converts the status of mRNA cap from Cap-0 to Cap-1, and thus, helps the virus evade immune surveillance in the host cell. Here, we report two structures of nsp16/nsp10 representing pre- and post-release states of the RNA product (Cap-1). We observe overall widening of the enzyme upon product formation, and an inward twisting motion in the substrate binding region upon product release. These conformational changes reset the enzyme for the next round of catalysis. The structures also identify a unique binding mode and the importance of a divalent metal ion for 2-O methylation. We also describe underlying structural basis for the perturbed enzymatic activity of a clinical variant of SARS-CoV-2, and a previous SARS-CoV outbreak strain.",Thiruselvam Viswanathan; Anurag Misra; Siu-Hong Chan; Shan Qi; Nan Dai; Shailee Arya; Luis Martinez-Sobrido; Yogesh K.

370,Spike vs nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection: application in nasopharyngeal swab specimens,"Public health experts emphasize the need for quick, point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection as an effective strategy for controlling virus spread. To this end, many ""antigen"" detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2s nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprised of four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spikes S1 subunit. The assays performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike-assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct<25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct<25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being out-performed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results.

372,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are detectable in saliva,"Vaccines are critical for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within [~]1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5). Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied. Here, we report that antibodies to the S-protein and its RBD are present in saliva samples from mRNA-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). Within 1-2 weeks after their second dose, 37/37 and 8/8 recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, had S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, while IgA was detected in a substantial proportion.

374,Novel inhibition mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 main protease by ebselen and its derivatives,"The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has triggered numerous efforts to develop therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), which is a critical enzyme for transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2, is a key target for therapeutic development against COVID-19. An organoselenium drug called ebselen has recently been demonstrated to have strong inhibition against Mpro and antiviral activity but its molecular mode of action is unknown preventing further development. We have examined the binding modes of ebselen and its derivative in Mpro via high resolution co-crystallography and investigated their chemical reactivity via mass spectrometry. Stronger Mpro inhibition than ebselen and potent ability to rescue infected cells were observed for a number of ebselen derivatives. A free selenium atom bound with cysteine 145 of Mpro catalytic dyad has been revealed by crystallographic studies of Mpro with ebselen and MR6-31-2 suggesting hydrolysis of the enzyme bound organoselenium covalent adduct, formation of a phenolic by-product is confirmed by mass spectrometry.

375,Determining the risk of developing symptomatic covid-19 infection after attending hospital for radiological examinations: controlled cohort study,"OBJECTIVETo determine whether brief attendance for outpatient radiological investigations is associated with increased risk of clinically significant coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection.

DESIGNObservational cohort study with a historical control.

SETTING2 large UK University Hospitals located in Nottingham and Cardiff.

PARTICIPANTSAll 47,340 patients who attended an outpatient radiology appointment at Nottingham University Hospitals and University Hospital of Wales during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, and 70,655 patients that comprised the control cohort who attended for outpatient radiology the same period in 2019.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe risk of developing clinically significant covid-19 infection within 28-days of attending a radiological examination. Covid-19 infection rates for the 2020 cohort were compared against a control group who attended in 2019.

RESULTS84 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were temporally associated with 47,340 radiological examinations across two hospitals in 2020. This low infection rate was higher than the 2019 control cohort; OR 2.507 (1.766 - 3.559) and equates to an approximate 1 positive covid-19 infection per 1000 radiology investigations.

CONCLUSIONSOur data suggests that attending hospitals for outpatient radiological investigations during the pandemic is associated with a very small absolute risk of acquiring clinically significant covid-19 infection. It is unlikely that this risk is directly attributable to radiology attendance, considering the reasons leading individuals to attend hospitals during the pandemic, the true attributable risk will likely be even lower.

377,Tiled-ClickSeq for targeted sequencing of complete coronavirus genomes with simultaneous capture of RNA recombination and minority variants,"High-throughput genomics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to characterize virus evolution and to identify adaptations that affect pathogenicity or transmission. While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called  Tiled-ClickSeq. Tiled-ClickSeq uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, obviating the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction using Illumina adaptors generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5UTR, at high depth and specificity to virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.",Andrew Laurence Routh; Elizabeth Jaworski; Rose M Langsjoen; Barbara Judy; Patrick Newman; Yiyang Zhou; Daniele Swetnam; Aaron L Miller; Jessica A Plante; Kenneth S Plante; Jianli Dong; Ping Ren; Thomas Ksiazek; Vineet D Menachery; Scott Weaver,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434828,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434828,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False

After multiple testing correction, troponin I3, cardiac type (TNNI3) had the strongest effect (odds ratio (O.R.) of 6.86 per standard deviation increase in protein level), with proteinase 3 (PRTN3) (O.R.=2.48), major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 2 (HLA-DQA2) (O.R.=2.29), the C4A-C4B heterodimer (O.R.=1.76) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1 (LRPAP1) (O.R.=1.73) also being associated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. Conversely, major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MHC1A) (O.R.=0.6) and natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3 (NCR3) (O.R.=0.46) were associated with lower odds. These proteins are involved in heart muscle contraction, natural killer and antigen presenting cells, and the major histocompatibility complex. Based on these findings, it may be possible to better predict which patients may develop severe COVID-19 and to design better treatments targeting the implicated mechanisms.",Alish B.

379,Functional Antibodies in COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma,"In the absence of an effective vaccine or monoclonal therapeutic, transfer of convalescent plasma (CCP) was proposed early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as an easily accessible therapy. However, despite the global excitement around this historically valuable therapeutic approach, results from CCP trials have been mixed and highly debated. Unlike other therapeutic interventions, CCP represents a heterogeneous drug. Each CCP unit is unique and collected from an individual recovered COVID-19 patient, making the interpretation of therapeutic benefit more complicated. While the prevailing view in the field would suggest that it is administration of neutralizing antibodies via CCP that centrally provides therapeutic benefit to newly infected COVID-19 patients, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients already possess neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of antibodies can extend far beyond their simple ability to bind and block infection, especially related to their ability to interact with the innate immune system. In our work we deeply profiled the SARS-CoV-2-specific Fc-response in CCP donors, along with the recipients prior to and after CCP transfer, revealing striking SARS-CoV-2 specific Fc-heterogeneity across CCP units and their recipients. However, CCP units possessed more functional antibodies than acute COVID-19 patients, that shaped the evolution of COVID-19 patient humoral profiles via distinct immunomodulatory effects that varied by pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG titers in the patients. Our analysis identified surprising influence of both S and Nucleocapsid (N) specific antibody functions not only in direct antiviral activity but also in anti-inflammatory effects. These findings offer insights for more comprehensive interpretation of correlates of immunity in ongoing large scale CCP trials and for the design of next generation therapeutic design.",Jonathan D Herman; Chuangqi Wang; Carolin Loos; Hyun ah Yoon; Johanna Rivera; M.

380,Point-of-care ultrasonography for risk stratification of non-critical suspected COVID-19 patients on admission (POCUSCO): a prospective binational study,"BackgroundLung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is highly effective in detecting pulmonary peripheral patterns and may allow early identification of patients who are likely to develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that L-POCUS performed during the initial examination would identify non-severe COVID-19 patients with a high risk of getting worse.

MethodsPOCUSCO was a prospective, multicenter study. Non-critical adult patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included and had L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following admission. The severity of lung damage was assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. The primary outcome was the rate of patients requiring intubation or who died within 14 days following inclusion.

ResultsAmong 296 participating patients, 8 (2.7%) had primary outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic of L-POCUS was 0.80 [95%CI:0.60-0.94]. The score values which achieved a sensibility > 95% in defining low-risk patients and a specificity > 95% in defining high-risk patients were <1 and [&ge;]16, respectively. The rate of patients with an unfavorable outcome was 0/95 (0%[95%CI:0-3.9]) for low-risk patients (score=0) versus 4/184 (2.17%[95%CI:0.8-5.5]) for intermediate-risk patients (score 1-15) and 4/17 (23.5%[95%CI:11.4-42.4]) for high-risk patients (score [&ge;]16). In patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n=58), the AUC of L-POCUS was 0.97 [95%CI:0.92-1.00].

ConclusionsL-POCUS allows risk-stratification of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. These results should be confirmed in a population with a higher risk of an unfavorable outcome.

381,Exploring the short-term role of particulate matter in the COVID-19 outbreak in USA cities,"The role of particulate matter (PM) in the COVID-19 pandemic is currently being discussed by the scientific community. Long-term (years) exposure to PM is known to affect human health by increasing susceptibility to viral infections as well as to the development of respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. In the short-term (days to months), PM has been suggested to assist airborne viral transmission. However, confounding factors such as urban mobility prevent causal conclusions. In this study, we explore short-term relationships between PM concentrations and the evolution of COVID-19 cases in a number of cities in the United States of America. We focus on the role of PM in facilitating viral transmission in early stages of the pandemic. We analyzed PM concentrations in two particle size ranges, < 2.5 {micro}m, and between 10 and 2.5 {micro}m (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Granger causality analysis was employed to identify instantaneous and lagged effects of pollution in peaks of COVID-19 new daily cases in each location. The effect of pollution in shaping the disease spread was evaluated by correlating the logistic growth rate of accumulated cases with pollutants concentrations for a range of time lags and accumulation windows. PM2.5 shows the most significant results in Granger causality tests in comparison with the other pollutants. We found a strong and significant association between PM2.5 concentrations and the growth rate of accumulated cases between the 1st and 18th days after the report of the infection, peaking at the 8th day. By comparing results of PM2.5 with PM10, CO and NO2 we rule out confounding effects associated with mobility. We conclude that PM2.5 is not a first order effect in the cities considered; however, it plays a significant role in facilitating the COVID-19 transmission. We estimate that the growth rate of COVID-19 cases would be risen by 12.5% if PM2.5 is increased from 25 to 35 {micro}g m-3.",Leonardo Yoshiaki Kamigauti; Gabriel Martins Palma Perez; Carlos Eduardo Souto-Oliveira; Elizabeth Cowdery; Paulo Hilario Nascimento Saldiva; Maria de Fatima Andrade,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253212,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253212,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
382,High-resolution epigenome analysis in nasal samples derived from children with respiratory viral infections reveals striking changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundDNA methylation patterns of the human genome can be modified by environmental stimuli and provide dense information on gene regulatory circuitries. We studied genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal samples from infants (<6 months) applying whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize epigenome response to 10 different respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsWe identified virus-specific differentially methylated regions (vDMR) with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2 followed by Influenza B (Flu B) causing the weakest vs. strongest epigenome response with 496 vs. 78541 and 14361 vDMR, respectively. We found a strong replication rate of FluB (52%) and SARS-CoV-2 (42%) vDMR in independent samples indicating robust epigenome perturbation upon infection. Among the FluB and SARS-CoV-2 vDMRs, around 70% were hypomethylated and significantly enriched among epithelial cell-specific regulatory elements whereas the hypermethylated vDMRs for these viruses mapped more frequently to immune cell regulatory elements, especially those of the myeloid lineage. The hypermethylated vDMRs were also enriched among genes and genetic loci in monocyte activation pathways and monocyte count. Finally, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing characterization of nasal mucosa in response to these two viruses to functionally analyze the epigenome perturbations. Which supports the trends we identified in methylation data and highlights and important role for monocytes.

ConclusionsAll together, we find evidence indicating genetic predisposition to innate immune response upon a respiratory viral infection.

383,Predicting the Efficacy of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donor Units with the Lumit Dx anti-Receptor Binding Domain Assay.,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 that causes COVID-19 has resulted in the death of more than 2.5 million people, but no cure exists. Although passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable therapeutic option, the selection of optimal units for therapy in a timely fashion remains a barrier.

Study design and methodsSince virus neutralization is a necessary characteristic of plasma that can benefit recipients, the neutralizing titers of plasma samples were measured using a retroviral-pseudotype assay. Binding antibody titers to the spike (S) protein were also determined by a clinically available serological assay (Ortho-Vitros total IG), and an in-house ELISA. The results of these assays were compared to a measurement of antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 S protein (Promega Lumit Dx).

ResultsAll measures of antibodies were highly variable, but correlated, to different degrees, with each other. However, the anti-RBD antibodies correlated with viral neutralizing titers to a greater extent than the other antibody assays.

DiscussionOur observations support the use of an anti-RBD assay such as the Lumit Dx assay, as an optimal predictor of the neutralization capability of CCP.",Sanath Kumar Janaka; Natasha M Clark; David T Evans; Joseph P Connor,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253135,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253135,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
384,What level of neutralising antibody protects from COVID-19? .,"Both previous infection and vaccination have been shown to provide potent protection from COVID-19. However, there are concerns that waning immunity and viral variation may lead to a loss of protection over time. Predictive models of immune protection are urgently needed to identify immune correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we modelled the relationship between in vitro neutralisation levels and observed protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection using data from seven current vaccines as well as convalescent cohorts. Here we show that neutralisation level is highly predictive of immune protection. The 50% protective neutralisation level was estimated to be approximately 20% of the average convalescent level (95% CI = 14-28%). The estimated neutralisation level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level (CI = 0.7-13%, p = 0.0004). Given the relationship between in vitro neutralization titer and protection, we then used this to investigate how waning immunity and antigenic variation might affect vaccine efficacy. We found that the decay of neutralising titre in vaccinated subjects over the first 3-4 months after vaccination was at least as rapid as the decay observed in convalescent subjects. Modelling the decay of neutralisation titre over the first 250 days after immunisation predicts a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralisation titres against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared to the vaccine strain and our model predicts the relationship between neutralisation and efficacy against viral variants. Our analyses provide an evidence-based prediction of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.",David S Khoury; Deborah Cromer; Arnold Reynaldi; Timothy E Schlub; Adam K Wheatley; Jennifer A Juno; Kanta Subbarao; Stephen J Kent; James A Triccas; Miles P Davenport,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252641,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
385,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is extremely vivacious in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic calls for rapid actions, now principally oriented to a world-wide vaccination campaign.

In this study we verified if, in individuals with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single dose of mRNA vaccine would be immunologically equivalent to a full vaccine schedule in naive individuals.

MethodsHealth care workers (184) with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were sampled soon before the second dose of vaccine and between 7 and 10 days after the second dose, the last sampling time was applied to SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals, too.

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay.

The study was powered for non-inferiority. We used non parametric tests and Pearson correlation test to perform inferential analysis.

ResultsAfter a single vaccine injection, the median titer of specific antibodies in individuals with previous COVID-19 was 30,527 U/ml (IQR 19,992-39,288) and in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection was 19,367.5 U/ml (IQR 14,688-31,353) (P=0.032). Both results were far above the median titer in naive individuals after a full vaccination schedule: 1,974.5 U/ml (IQR 895-3,455) (P<0.0001). Adverse events after vaccine injection were more frequent after the second dose of vaccine (mean 0.95, 95%CI from 0.75 to 1.14 versus mean 1.91, 95%CI from 1.63 to 2.19)(P<0.0001) and in exposed compared to naive (mean 1.63; 95%CI from 1.28 to 1.98 versus mean 2.35; 95%CI from 1.87 to 2.82)(P=0.015).

ConclusionIn SARS-CoV-2 naturally infected individuals a single mRNA vaccine dose seems sufficient to reach immunity.

386,"Bromodomain and Extraterminal Protein Inhibitor, Apabetalone (RVX-208), Reduces ACE2 Expression and Attenuates SARS-CoV-2 Infection in vitro","Effective therapeutics are urgently needed to counter infection and improve outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19 and to combat this pandemic. Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells. Moreover, we show that apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to antiviral agents. Taken together, our study supports further evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19, either alone or in combination with emerging therapeutics.

387,Low ozone concentration and negative ions for rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation,"Ozone is a powerful anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral agent, yet exposure to high levels of ozone can pose risks to human/animal health and, in the long term, corrode certain objects. In order to overcome these risks, we evaluated the potential of using a relatively short exposure of a low concentration of ozone to disinfect an indoor environment in the absence of individuals and animals. ICON3 by O3ZONO/M2L, a new disinfection device generating both ozone and negative ions, was selected to assess the potential of this strategy to inactivate different viral isolates of SARS-CoV-2.

Tests under controlled laboratory conditions were performed in a system consisting of an ozone-proof airtight plastic box inside a biological safety cabinet, where suspensions of two strains of SARS-CoV-2 were exposed to ozone and negative ions and virucidal activity was measured by means of two complementary methodologies: viral replication capacity and viral titer determination.

These studies revealed that low concentration ozone (average 3.18 ppm after the peak) inactivated up to >99% of SARS-CoV-2 within 20 minutes of exposure. Under controlled conditions, similar ozone exposure was recreated with ICON3 in different volume rooms (15, 30, 60 m3) where a linear relationship was observed between the room volume and the time of continuous ozone/ions flow required to reach and maintain the desired ozone levels used in the laboratory studies.

These studies suggest that ICON3 may have the potential for use in the disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments in the absence of individuals and animals, under properly controlled and monitored safety conditions.",Davide De Forni; Barbara Poddesu; Giulia Cugia; Giovanni Gallizia; Massimo La Licata; Julianna Lisziewicz; James G.

388,In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies predict REGEN-COV protection against emergence of viral escape in humans,"Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a clinically validated therapeutic option against COVID-19. As rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of minor virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in nature or identified from preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies and in the clinic. This study demonstrates that a combination of noncompeting antibodies not only provides full coverage against currently circulating variants but also protects against emergence of new such variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical setting.",Richard Copin; Alina Baum; Elzbieta Wloga; Kristen E Pascal; Stephanie Giordano; Benjamin O Fulton; Anbo Zhou; Nicole Negron; Kathryn Lanza; Newton Chan; Angel Coppola; Joyce Chiu; Min Ni; Gurinder S Atwal; Annabel Romero Hernandez; Kei Saotome; Yi Zhou; Matthew C Franklin; Andrea T Hooper; Shane McCarthy; Sara Hamon; Jennifer D Hamilton; Hilary M Staples; Kendra Alfson; Ricardo Carrion Jr.; Shazia Ali; Thomas Norton; Selin Somersan-Karakaya; Sumathi Sivapalasingam; Gary A Herman; David M Weinreich; Leah Lipsich; Neil Stahl; Andrew J Murphy; George D Yancopoulos; Christos A Kyratsous,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434834,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434834,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
389,Phodopus roborovskii SH101 as a systemic infection model of SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide threat with its unusually high transmission rates and rapid evolution into diverse strains. Unlike typical respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes systemic infection by breaking the boundaries of the respiratory systems. The development of animal models recapitulating the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of utmost importance not only for the development of vaccines and antivirals but also for understanding the pathogenesis. However, there has not been developed an animal model for systemic infection of SARS-CoV-2 representing most aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with systemic symptoms. Here we report that a hamster strain of Phodopus roborovskii SH101, a laboratory inbred hamster strain of P. roborovskii, displayed most symptoms of systemic infection upon SARS-CoV-2 infection as in the case of the human counterpart, unlike current COVID-19 animal models. P. roborovskii SH101 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2 represented most clinical symptoms of COVID-19 such as snuffling, dyspnea, cough, labored breathing, hunched posture, progressive weight loss, and ruffled fur, in addition to high fever following shaking chills. Histological examinations also revealed a serious right-predominated pneumonia as well as slight organ damages in the brain and liver, manifesting systemic COVID-19 cases. Considering the merit of a small animal as well as its clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, this hamster model seems to provide an ideal tool to investigate COVID-19.

Author summaryAlthough the current animal models supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed varying degrees of illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infections of SARS-CoV-2 were mainly limited to the respiratory systems of these animals, including hACE2 transgenic mice, hamsters, ferrets, fruit bats, guinea pigs, African green monkey, Rhesus macaques, and Cynomolgus macaques. While these animal models can be a modest model for the respiratory infection, there is a clear limit for use them in the study of COVID-19 that also displays multiple systemic symptoms. Therefore, the development of an animal model recapitulating COVID-19-specific symptoms such as the right-predominated pneumonia would be the utmost need to overcome the imminent threat posed by COVID-19. We identified a very interesting hamster strain, Phodopus roborovskii SH101, which mimics almost all aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike the current animal models, SARS-CoV-2-infected P. roborovskii SH101 not only displayed the symptoms of respiratory infection but also clinical manifestations specific to human COVID-19 such as high fever following shaking chills, serious right-predominated pneumonia, and minor organ damages in the brain and liver.",Chongkai Zhai; Mingda Wang; Hea-Jong Chung; Md.

390,Emerging variants of concern in SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein: a highly conserved target with potential pathological and therapeutic implications,"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) gene are relatively uncommon. The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulfate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. The rapid emergence of this sub-B.1 clade with recurrent I82T mutation suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434758,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434758,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False

392,Prediction of COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients in Sudan,"BackgroundCOVID-19 was primarily reported in China. The mortality rate across countries had ranged from 1% up to more than 10% and it is underestimated in some countries. Advanced age is the most frequently reported factor associated to mortality. Other factors were the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. Several models for mortality prediction had been developed to assist in improving the prognosis. The aim of our study was to assess the factors related to mortality among COVID-19 patients and develop a prediction model based on these factors.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study assessed the factors related to the mortality among COVID-19 patients who attended Imperial Hospital isolation centre on November-December, 2020, Khartoum, Sudan. Statistical tests performed were chi-square test, odds ratio and regression to develop the prediction model. Tests were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

Results105 patients were studied. 29% of the patients were deceased, while, 71% were discharged alive. A statistically significant association was found between the age and severity with regards to mortality rate (p=0.034, 0.018 respectively). The model equation for mortality prediction: Mortality = -14.724+ (1.387* Age) + (-0.323* Gender) + (1.814* Admission) + (0.193* Ischemic Heart Disease) + (-0.369* Fever) + (1.595* Cough) + (1.953* Complications) + (0.149* Duration of hospitalization) + (0.999* Enoxaparin dose).

393,Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to baseline antibody status in staff and residents of 100 Long Term Care Facilities (VIVALDI study),"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection represents a major challenge for Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) and many residents and staff are now sero-positive following persistent outbreaks. We investigated the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and subsequent infection in this population.

MethodsProspective cohort study of infection in staff and residents in 100 LTCFs in England between October 2020 and February 2021. Blood samples were collected at baseline (June 2020), 2 and 4 months and tested for IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken weekly in staff and monthly in residents. The primary analysis estimated the relative hazard of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, from Cox regression adjusted for age and gender, and stratified by LTCF.

FindingsStudy inclusion criteria were met by 682 residents and 1429 staff. Baseline IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 residents (33%) and 408 staff (29%). A total of 93 antibody-negative residents had a PCR-positive test (0.054 per month at risk) compared to 4 antibody-positive residents (0.007 per month at risk). There were 111 PCR-positive tests in antibody-negative staff (0.042 per month at risk) compared to 10 in antibody-positive staff (0.009 per month at risk). The adjusted hazard ratios for reinfection in staff and residents with a baseline positive versus negative antibody test were 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.40) and 0.39 ((95% CI: 0.19-0.77) respectively. Of 12 reinfected participants with data on symptoms, 11 were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases.

InterpretationThe presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid) and MedRxiv on 18 January 2021 for studies in LTCFs that described the risk of infection in individuals who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to individuals who were seronegative. Search terms were deliberately broad to improve capture of relevant literature and included ""SARS-CoV-2""OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""coronavirus"" AND ""care home"" OR ""nursing home"" OR ""long term care facility"" with no date or language restrictions. We did not identify any publications that focussed on risk of reinfection in seropositive individuals, but subsequent to our search one study has been published using data from two LTCFs in London, UK. This study reported a 96% reduction in the odds of reinfection in individuals who were seropositive compared to those who were seronegative based on 4-month follow-up in 161 participants. We found 10 studies that performed seroprevalence surveys in either staff or staff and residents in LTCFs in 8 cohorts. Five of these were carried out in response to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within the care homes, either as part of the subsequent investigation or as post-infection surveillance. The largest of these, which enrolled both staff and residents, was performed in 6 LTCFs and performed longitudinal antibody testing.

Added value of this studyWe undertook a cohort study in staff and residents from 100 LTCFs in England to investigate whether individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection could be infected twice. Staff and residents were offered up to three rounds of antibody testing and antibody results were linked to PCR test results which were obtained weekly from staff and monthly from residents through the national SARS-CoV-2 testing programme. This study, which was conducted in >2000 staff and residents, suggests that antibodies provide high levels of protection against reinfection for up to 10 months. Almost all cases of reinfection were symptomatic, but no cases required hospital treatment. Amongst those with detectable baseline antibodies, quantitative antibody titres against spike protein and nucleocapsid were comparable between cases of reinfection and those who did not become reinfected.

Implications of all available evidenceDespite high background rates of infection in LTCFs, the overall risk of reinfection was low in this population. This is broadly consistent with findings from large cohort studies of hospital staff, but, importantly, extends the evidence of substantial protection to frail elderly, who are vulnerable to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 due to age-related changes in immunity (immune-senescence) and high levels of comorbidity. The low risk of reinfection in our study suggests identification of immune correlates of protection in this population will require pooling of data across multiple cohorts.

As vaccination coverage in residents approaches 100% in England, it will be important to understand whether vaccination and natural infection provide comparable levels of protection against infection. Such insights will inform future policy decisions regarding re-vaccination schedules in LTCF, and the longer-term need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as asymptomatic testing and visitor restrictions.",Maria Krutikov; Tom Palmer; Gokhan Tut; Chris Fuller; Madhumita Shrotri; Haydn Williams; Daniel Davies; Aidan Irwin-Singer; James Robson; Andrew Hayward; Paul Moss; Andrew Copas; Laura J Shallcross,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253110,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253110,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,True
394,Detection of autoimmune antibodies in severe but not in moderate or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients,"The heterogeneity of COVID-19 lies within its diverse symptoms and severity, ranging from mild to lethal. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients, characterized by a hyper cytokine storm. Autoimmunity is proposed to occur as a result of COVID-19, given the high similarity of the immune responses observed in COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. Here, we investigate the level of autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients with different severities. Initial screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) IgG revealed that 1.6% (2/126) and 4% (5/126) of ICU COVID-19 cases developed strong and moderate ANA levels, respectively. However, all the non-ICU cases (n=273) were ANA negative. The high ANA level was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IFA) and large-scale autoantibody screening by phage immunoprecipitation-sequencing (PhIP-Seq). Indeed, the majority of the samples showed ""speckled"" ANA pattern by microscopy, and we demonstrate that samples of ICU patients with strong and moderate ANA levels contain autoantibody specificities that predominantly targeted proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, apoptotic processes, and cell death; further denoting reactivity to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. In conclusion, our results further support the notion of routine screening for autoimmune responses in COVID-19 patients, which might help improve disease prognosis and patient management. Further, results provide compelling evidence that ANA-positive individuals should be excluded from being donors for convalescent plasma therapy in the context of Covid-19.",Aisha D.

395,Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vaccinated individuals,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus is consistently evolving with mutations within the receptor binding domain (RBD)1 being of particular concern2-4. To date, there is little research into protection offered following vaccination or infection against RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern (UK3, South African5, Mink6 and Southern California7). To investigate this, serum and saliva samples were obtained from groups of vaccinated (Pfizer BNT-162b28), infected and uninfected individuals. Antibody responses among groups, including salivary antibody response and antibody binding to RBD mutant strains were examined. The neutralization capacity of the antibody response against a patient-isolated South African variant was tested by viral neutralization tests and further verified by an ACE2 competition assay. We found that humoral responses in vaccinated individuals showed a robust response after the second dose. Interestingly, IgG antibodies were detected in large titers in the saliva of vaccinated subjects. Antibody responses showed considerable differences in binding to RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern. A substantial reduction in RBD binding and neutralization was detected for the South African variant. Taken together our data reinforces the importance of administering the second dose of Pfizer BNT-162b2 to acquire high levels of neutralizing antibodies. High antibody titers in saliva suggest that vaccinated individuals may have reduced transmission potential. Substantially reduced neutralization for the South African variant highlights importance of surveillance strategies to detect new variants and targeting these in future vaccines.",Matthias Becker; Alex Dulovic; Daniel Junker; Natalia Ruetalo; Philipp Kaiser; Yudi Pinilla; Constanze Heinzel; Julia Haering; Bjoern Traenkle; Teresa Wagner; Mirjam Layer; Martin Mehrlaender; Valbona Mirakaj; Jana Held; Hannes Planatscher; Katja Schenke-Layland; Gerard Krause; Monika Strengert; Tamam Bakchoul; Karina Althaus; Rolf Fendel; Andrea Kreidenweiss; Michael Koeppen; Ulrich Rothbauer; Michael Schindler; Nicole Schneiderhan-Marra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252958,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252958,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,True
396,Agreement between commercially available ELISA and in-house Luminex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSerological diagnostic of the severe respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a valuable tool for the determination of immunity and surveillance of exposure to the virus. In the context of an ongoing pandemic, it is essential to externally validate widely used tests to assure correct diagnostics and epidemiological estimations. We evaluated the performance of the COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM/A (Vircell, S.L.) against a highly specific and sensitive in-house Luminex immunoassay in a set of samples from pregnant women and cord blood. The agreement between both assays was moderate to high for IgG but low for IgM/A. Considering seropositivity by either IgG and/or IgM/A, the technical performance of the ELISA was highly imbalanced, with 96% sensitivity at the expense of 22% specificity. As for the clinical performance, the negative predictive value reached 87% while the positive predictive value was 51%.

397,High levels of common cold coronavirus antibodies in convalescent plasma are associated with improved survival in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundCOVID-19 Convalescent plasma (CCP) is safe and effective, particularly if given at an early stage of the disease. Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP.

Patients and MethodsPatients [&ge;]18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed.

ResultsCCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex.

398,Trends over time in the risk of adverse outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"ObjectivesWe aimed to describe trends in the incidence of adverse outcomes among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between February and September 2020 within a national healthcare system.

SettingUS Veterans Affairs national healthcare system.

ParticipantsEnrollees in the VA healthcare system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 2/28/2020 and 9/30/2020 (n=55,952).

OutcomesDeath, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation within 30 days of testing positive.The incidence of these outcomes was examined among patients infected each month and trends were evaluated using an interrupted time-series analysis.

ResultsBetween February and July 2020, during the first wave of the US pandemic, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), with subsequent stabilization between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and documented symptoms and after additional adjustment for laboratory test results among hospitalized patients, including among subgroups admitted to the ICU and treated with mechanical ventilation. Among hospitalized patients, use of hydroxychloroquine (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%) vasopressors (20.6% to 8.7%), and dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) decreased while use of dexamethasone (3.4% to 53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%) and remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%) increased from February to September.

399,Plasma ACE2 levels predict outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enabling entrance of the virus into cells and causing the infection termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a disease with a very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic and subclinical infection to severe hyperinflammatory syndrome and death.

MethodsThis study used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort with Olink Proteomics). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 outcomes scale. The samples were run on the Olink(R) Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein.

FindingsHigh baseline levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were associated with worse WHOmax category at 28 days with OR=0.56, 95%-CI: 0.44-0.71 (P < 0.0001). This association was significant in regression models with correction for baseline characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and laboratory test results. High levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were also significantly associated with worse WHO category at the time of blood sampling at both day 0, day 3, and day 7 (P = 0.0004, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001, respectively). The levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly higher compared to patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). The plasma ACE2 levels were also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). There was no difference in plasma ACE2 levels comparing patients with or without pre-existing lung disease, diabetes, or immunosuppressive conditions (P = 0.953, P = 0.291, and P = 0.237, respectively). The associations between high plasma levels of ACE2 and worse WHOmax category during 28 days were more pronounced in COVID-19 positive patients compared with COVID-19 negative patients but the difference was not significant in the two-way ANOVA analysis.

InterpretationThis study suggests that measuring ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Further, ACE2 levels could be a link between severe COVID-19 disease and its risk factors, namely hypertension, pre-existing heart disease and pre-existing kidney disease. The design of the data analysis using the Olink platform does not allow assessment of quantitative differences. However, previous studies have described a positive correlation between plasma ACE2 and ACE1 activity. This is interesting because ACE1 (serum ACE) analysis is a standardized test in most hospital laboratories. Therefore, our study encourages quantitative investigations of both plasma ACE 1 and 2 in COVID-19.

400,"Convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","BackgroundTreatment of COVID-19 patients with plasma containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) several possible treatments are being compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to receive either usual care plus high titre convalescent plasma or usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.

FindingsBetween 28 May 2020 and 15 January 2021, 5795 patients were randomly allocated to receive convalescent plasma and 5763 to usual care alone. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1398 (24%) of 5795 patients allocated convalescent plasma and 1408 (24%) of 5763 patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 1{middle dot}00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}93 to 1{middle dot}07; p=0{middle dot}93). The 28-day mortality rate ratio was similar in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including in those patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at randomisation. Allocation to convalescent plasma had no significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days (66% vs. 67%; rate ratio 0{middle dot}98; 95% CI 0{middle dot}94-1{middle dot}03, p=0{middle dot}50). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death (28% vs. 29%; rate ratio 0{middle dot}99; 95% CI 0{middle dot}93-1{middle dot}05, p=0{middle dot}79).

ObjectiveTo estimate the prevalence and correlates of persistent COVID-19 symptoms 30 and 60 days post onset using a population-based sample.

Design & SettingThe Michigan COVID-19 Recovery Surveillance Study is a population-based cross-sectional survey of a probability sample of adults with confirmed COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). Respondents completed a survey online or via telephone in English, Spanish, or Arabic between June - December 2020.

ParticipantsLiving non-institutionalized adults (aged 18+) in MDSS with COVID-19 onset through mid-April 2020 were eligible for selection (n=28,000). Among 2,000 adults selected, 629 completed the survey. We excluded 79 cases during data collection due to ineligibility, 6 asymptomatic cases, 7 proxy reports, and 24 cases missing outcome data, resulting in a sample size of 593. The sample was predominantly female (56.1%), aged 45 and older (68.2%), and Non-Hispanic White (46.3%) or Black (34.8%).

ExposuresDemographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and annual household income) and clinical factors (smoking status, body mass index, diagnosed comorbidities, and illness severity).

Main outcomes and MeasuresWe defined post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) as persistent symptoms 30+ days (30-day COVID-19) or 60+ days (60-day COVID-19) post COVID-19 onset.

Results30- and 60-day COVID-19 were highly prevalent (52.5% and 35.0%), even among respondents reporting mild symptoms (29.2% and 24.5%) and non-hospitalized respondents (43.7% and 26.9%, respectively). Low income was statistically significantly associated with 30-day COVID-19 in adjusted models. Respondents reporting very severe (vs. mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30-day COVID-19 (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.46-3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.71, 95% 1.02-2.88). Hospitalized (vs. non-hospitalized) respondents had about 40% higher prevalence of both 30-day (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) and 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.93).

402,Increased mortality among individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 during the second wave in South Africa,"IntroductionSouth Africa experienced its first wave of COVID-19 peaking in mid-July 2020 and a larger second wave peaking in January 2021, in which the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 lineage predominated. We aimed to compare in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves of COVID-19.

MethodsWe analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 hospitalisations. We defined four wave periods using incidence risk for hospitalisation, pre-wave 1, wave 1, pre-wave 2 and wave 2. We compared the characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 cases in wave 1 and wave 2, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality accounting for wave period using multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsPeak rates of COVID-19 cases, admissions and in-hospital deaths in the second wave exceeded the rates in the first wave (138.1 versus 240.1; 16.7 versus 28.9; and 3.3 versus 7.1 respectively per 100,000 persons). The weekly average incidence risk increase in hospitalisation was 22% in wave 1 and 28% in wave 2 [ratio of growth rate in wave two compared to wave one: 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05]. On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 20% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave (adjusted OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3). In-hospital case fatality-risk (CFR) increased in weeks of peak hospital occupancy, from 17.9% in weeks of low occupancy (<3,500 admissions) to 29.6% in weeks of very high occupancy (>12,500 admissions) (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.5).

Compared to the first wave, individuals hospitalised in the second wave, were more likely to be older, 40-64 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.1] and [&ge;]65 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.1] compared to <40 years; and admitted in the public sector [OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.8]; and less likely to have comorbidities [OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5-0.5].

ConclusionsIn South Africa, the second wave was associated with higher incidence and more rapid increase in hospitalisations, and increased in-hospital mortality. While some of this is explained by increasing pressure on the health system, a residual increase in mortality of hospitalised patients beyond this, could be related to the new lineage 501Y.V2.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT O_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyMost countries have reported higher numbers of COVID-19 cases in the second wave but lower case-fatality risk (CFR), in part due to new therapeutic interventions, increased testing and better prepared health systems. South Africa experienced its second wave which peaked in January 2021, in which the variant of concern, SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 predominated. New variants have been shown to be more transmissible and in the United Kingdom, to be associated with increased hospitalisation and mortality rates in people infected with variant B.1.1.7 compared to infection with non-B.1.1.7 viruses. There are currently limited data on the severity of lineage 501Y.V2.

Added value of this studyWe analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 hospitalisations, comparing in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves of COVID-19. The study revealed that after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 20% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave. Our study also describes the demographic shift from the first to the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa, and quantifies the impact of overwhelmed hospital capacity on in-hospital mortality.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur data suggest that the new lineage (501Y.V2) in South Africa may be associated with increased in-hospital mortality during the second wave. Our data should be interpreted with caution however as our analysis is based on a comparison of mortality in the first and second wave as a proxy for dominant lineage and we did not have individual-level data on lineage. Individual level studies comparing outcomes of people with and without the new lineage based on sequencing data are needed. To prevent high mortality in a potential third wave, we require a combination of strategies to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, to spread out the peak of the epidemic, which would prevent hospital capacity from being breached.

403,A High Rate of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Arabs: Results of a Large-scale Survey,"In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study (36,220 participants) that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects. Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness.

404,COVID-19 is associated with multiple sclerosis exacerbations that are prevented by disease modifying therapies,"BackgroundInfections can trigger exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS). The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on MS are not known. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on new and pre-existing symptoms of MS.

MethodsThe COVID-19 and MS study is an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort study conducted as part of the United Kingdom MS Register. People with MS and COVID-19 were invited by email to complete a questionnaire about their MS symptoms during the infection. An MS exacerbation was defined as developing new MS symptoms and/or worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms.

ResultsFifty-seven percent (230/404) of participants had an MS exacerbation during their infection; 82 developed new MS symptoms, 207 experienced worsened pre-existing MS symptoms, and 59 reported both. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) reduced the likelihood of developing new MS symptoms during the infection (OR 0.556, 95%CI 0.316-0.978). Participants with a higher pre-COVID-19 webEDSS (web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale) score (OR 1.251, 95%CI 1.060-1.478) and longer MS duration (OR 1.042, 95%CI 1.009-1.076) were more likely to experience worsening of their pre-existing MS symptoms during the infection.

405,Efficacy of remdesivir in Japanese patients hospitalised with COVID-19: A large observational study using the COVID-19 Registry Japan,"SynopsisO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSResults from several randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of remdesivir with placebo have been reported. Data on the efficacy of remdesivir in Asian populations are limited, and conflicting results have been reported. The aim of the present study is to examine whether remdesivir is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 or not.

MethodsWe evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir from data acquired from the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of Japanese patients hospitalised with COVID-19, using five-to-one propensity score (PS) matching. Primary outcomes were overall risk of fatality, risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV/ECMO) and length of stay (LoS) in healthcare facilities.

ResultsIn total, 1907 of 15,225 patients met our inclusion criteria. After PS matching, 74 patients were assigned to the remdesivir case group and 195 patients to the non-remdesivir control group. In a PS-matched cohort, fatality risk (12.2% vs 13.3%; P = 1.0); risk of IMV/ECMO (5.4% vs 4.6%; P = 0.757); length of intensive care unit stay (6 vs 6 days; P = 0.473) and length of IMV (13 vs 5 days; P = 0.509) were not different between the case and control groups. LoS in the case group was longer than in the control group (14 vs 11 days; P < 0.001).

406,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Serology persistence over time in COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donors.,"BackgroundCharacterizing the kinetics of the antibody response to SARS{square}CoV{square}2 is of critical importance to developing strategies that may mitigate the public health burden of COVID-19. We sought to determine how circulating antibody levels change over time following natural infection.

Methods/MaterialsWe conducted a prospective, longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors at multiple time points over a 9-month period. At each study visit, subjects either donated plasma or only had study samples drawn. In all cases, anti-SARS-CoV-2 donor testing was performed using semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassays (ChLIA) targeting subunit 1 (S1) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and an in-house fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA).

ResultsFrom April to November 2020 we enrolled 202 donors, mean age 47.3 {+/-}14.7 years, 55% female, 75% Caucasian. Most donors reported a mild clinical course (91%, n=171) without hospitalization. One hundred and five (105) (52%) donors presented for repeat visits with a median 42 (12-163) days between visits. The final visit occurred at a median 160 (53-273) days post-symptom resolution. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab), SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 97.5%, 91.1%, and 74% of donors respectively at initial presentation. Neutralizing Ab titers based on FRNA50 were positively associated with mean IgG levels (p = <0.0001). Mean IgG levels and neutralizing titers were positively associated with COVID-19 severity, increased donor age and BMI (p=0.0006 and p=0.0028, p=0.0083 and p=0.0363, (p=0.0008 and p=0.0018, respectively). Over the course of repeat visits, IgG decreased in 74.1% of donors; FRNA50 decreased in 44.4% and remained unchanged in 33.3% of repeat donors. A weak negative correlation was observed between total Ab levels and number of days post-symptom recovery (r = 0.09).

ConclusionAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified in 97% of convalescent donors at initial presentation. In a cohort that largely did not require hospitalization. IgG and neutralizing antibodies were positively correlated with age, BMI and clinical severity, and persisted for up to 9 months post-recovery from natural infection. On repeat presentation, IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels decreased in 56% of repeat donors. Overall, these data suggest that CP donors possess a wide range of IgG and neutralizing antibody levels that are proportionally distributed across demographics, with the exception of age, BMI and clinical severity.",Valeria De Giorgi; Kamille A West; Amanda N Henning; Leonard Chen; Michael R Holbrook; Robin Gross; Janie Liang; Elena Postnikova; Joni Trenbeath; Sarah Pogue; Tania Scinto; Harvey J Alter; Cathy Conry Cantilena,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253093,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253093,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,True

408,Structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein monomer,"Coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, present an ongoing threat for human wellbeing. Consequently, elucidation of molecular determinants of their function and interaction with host is an important task. Whereas some of the coronaviral proteins are extensively characterized, others remain understudied. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein (a viroporin) in the monomeric form. The protein consists of the hydrophobic -helical transmembrane domain (TMD) and amphiphilic -helices H2 and H3, connected by flexible linkers. We show that TMD has a preferable orientation in the membrane, while H2 and H3 reside at the membrane surface. Orientation of H2 is strongly influenced by palmitoylation of cysteines Cys40, Cys43 and Cys44. Glycosylation of Asn66 affects the orientation of H3. We also observe that the E protein both generates and senses the membrane curvature, preferably localizing with the C-terminus at the convex regions of the membrane. This may be favorable for assembly of the E protein oligomers, whereas induction of curvature may facilitate budding of the viral particles. The presented results may be helpful for better understanding of the function of coronaviral E protein and viroporins in general, and for overcoming the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Alexander Kuzmin; Philipp Orekhov; Roman Astashkin; Valentin Gordeliy; Ivan Gushchin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434722,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434722,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
409,Longitudinal single-cell epitope and RNA-sequencing reveals the immunological impact of type 1 interferon autoantibodies in critical COVID-19,"Type I interferon (IFN-I) neutralizing autoantibodies have been found in some critical COVID-19 patients; however, their prevalence and longitudinal dynamics across the disease severity scale, and functional effects on circulating leukocytes remain unknown. Here, in 284 COVID-19 patients, we found IFN-I autoantibodies in 19% of critical, 6% of severe and none of the moderate cases. Longitudinal profiling of over 600,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single-cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 COVID-19 patients, 15 non-COVID-19 patients and 11 non-hospitalized healthy controls, revealed a lack of IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG-I) response in myeloid cells from critical cases, including those producing anti-IFN-I autoantibodies. Moreover, surface protein analysis showed an inverse correlation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 with ISG-I expression response early in the disease course. This aberrant ISG-I response in critical patients with and without IFN-I autoantibodies, supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression via convergent mechanisms.",Monique G.P. van der Wijst; Sara E.

Here, we use a hamster model of COVID-19 to show that prior infection with a strain representative of the original circulating lineage B of SARS-CoV-2 induces protection from clinical signs upon subsequent challenge with either B1.1.7 or B1.351 viruses, which recently emerged in the UK and South Africa, respectively. The results indicate that these emergent VOC may be unlikely to cause disease in individuals that are already immune due to prior infection, and this has positive implications for overall levels of infection and COVID-19 disease.",Jordan J Clark; Parul Sharma; Eleanor Bentley; Adam C Harding; Anja Kipar; Megan Neary; Helen Box; Grant Hughes; Edward I Patterson; Jo Sharp; Tulio de Oliveira; Alex Sigal; Julian Alexander Hiscox; William S James; Miles W Carroll; Andrew Owen; James P Stewart,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434447,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434447,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
411,Structures and function of locked conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike,"The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in three distinct pre-fusion conformations: locked, closed and open. Of these, the locked conformation was not previously observed for SARS-CoV-1 S and its function remains poorly understood. Here we engineered a SARS-CoV-2 S protein construct ""S-R/x3"" to arrest SARS-CoV-2 spikes in the locked conformation by a disulfide bond. Using this construct we determined high-resolution structures revealing two distinct locked states, with or without the D614G substitution that has become fixed in the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. The D614G mutation induces a structural change in domain D from locked-1 to locked-2 conformation to alter spike dynamics, promoting transition into the closed conformation from which opening of the receptor binding domain is permitted. The transition from locked to closed conformations is additionally promoted by a change from low to neutral pH. We propose that the locked conformations of S are present in the acidic cellular compartments where virus is assembled and egresses. In this model, release of the virion into the neutral pH extracellular space would favour transition to the closed form which itself can stochastically transition into the open form. The S-R/x3 construct provides a tool for the further structural and functional characterization of the locked conformations of S, as well as how sequence changes might alter S assembly and regulation of receptor binding domain dynamics.",Kun Qu; Xiaoli Xiong; Katarzyna A Ciazynska; Andrew P Carter; John A G Briggs,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434733,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434733,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
412,Potent neutralizing nanobodies resist convergent circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting novel and conserved epitopes,"There is an urgent need to develop effective interventions resistant to the evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2. Nanobodies (Nbs) are stable and cost-effective agents that can be delivered by novel aerosolization route to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections efficiently. However, it remains unknown if they possess broadly neutralizing activities against the prevalent circulating strains. We found that potent neutralizing Nbs are highly resistant to the convergent variants of concern that evade a large panel of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) and significantly reduce the activities of convalescent or vaccine-elicited sera. Subsequent determination of 9 high-resolution structures involving 6 potent neutralizing Nbs by cryoelectron microscopy reveals conserved and novel epitopes on virus spike inaccessible to Abs. Systematic structural comparison of neutralizing Abs and Nbs provides critical insights into how Nbs uniquely target the spike to achieve high-affinity and broadly neutralizing activity against the evolving virus.

413,Development of Equine Immunoglobulin Fragment F(ab')2 with High Neutralizing Capability against SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 has taken the world, and especially the scientific community by storm. While vaccines are being introduced into the market, there is also a pressing need to find potential drugs and therapeutic modules. Remdesivir is one of the antivirals currently being used with a limited window of action. As more drugs are being vetted, passive immunotherapy in the form of neutralizing antibodies can provide immediate action to combat the increasing numbers of COVID-positive cases. Herein, we demonstrate that equines hyper-immunized with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 generate high titers of antibody with a strong virus neutralizing potential. ELISA performed with pooled antisera displayed highest immunoglobulin titer on 42 days post-immunization, at 1:51,200 dilutions. F(ab)2 immunoglobulin fragments generated from the pools also showed very high, antigen-specific affinity at 1:102,400 dilutions. Finally, in vitro virus neutralization assays confirmed that different pools of F(ab)2 fragments could successfully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with titers well above 25,000, indicating the potential of this strategy in treating severe COVID-19 cases with high titers. The F(ab)2 was able to cross neutralize another SARS-CoV-2 strain, demonstrating its efficacy against the emerging viral variants and the importance of this approach in our efforts of eradication of COVID-19. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that virus-neutralizing antibodies raised in equines can potentially be used as a treatment regimen in the form of effective passive immunotherapy to combat COVID-19.",Divya Gupta Ms; Farhan Ahmed Dr; Dixit Tandel Mr; Haripriya Parthasarathy Ms; Dhiviya Vedagiri Ms; Vishal Sah Mr; Krishna Mohan Bodduluru Dr; Siddarth Shreedas Daga Mr; Rafiq Ahmad Khan Mr; Chiranjeevi Kondiparthi Mr; Prabhudas Savari Mr; Sandesh Hajarilal Jain Dr; Jaya Shreedas Daga Ms; Shashikala Reddy Dr; Nooruddin Khan Dr; Krishnan Harinivas Harshan Dr,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434030,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434030,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
414,The dual function monoclonal antibodies VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 demonstrate potent in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2,"VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 are dual action monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 were derived from a parent antibody (S309) isolated from memory B cells of a 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) survivor. Both mAbs contain an ""LS"" mutation in the Fc region to prolong serum half-life and potentially enhance distribution to the respiratory mucosa. In addition, VIR-7832 encodes an Fc GAALIE mutation that has been shown previously to evoke CD8+ T-cells in the context of an in vivo viral respiratory infection. VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 potently neutralize live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in vitro as well as pseudotyped viruses encoding spike protein from the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants. In addition, they retain activity against monoclonal antibody resistance mutations that confer reduced susceptibility to currently authorized mAbs. The VIR-7831/VIR-7832 epitope does not overlap with mutational sites in the current variants of concern and continues to be highly conserved among circulating sequences consistent with the high barrier to resistance observed in vitro. Furthermore, both mAbs can recruit effector mechanisms in vitro that may contribute to clinical efficacy via elimination of infected host cells. In vitro studies with these mAbs demonstrated no enhancement of infection. In a Syrian Golden hamster proof-of concept wildtype SARS-CoV-2 infection model, animals treated with VIR-7831 had less weight loss, and significantly decreased total viral load and infectious virus levels in the lung compared to a control mAb.

CBD and its metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, but not congeneric cannabinoids, potently block SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells. CBD acts after cellular infection, inhibiting viral gene expression and reversing many effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host gene transcription. CBD induces interferon expression and up-regulates its antiviral signaling pathway. A cohort of human patients previously taking CBD had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence of up to an order of magnitude relative to matched pairs or the general population.

Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of mAb-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. mAbs that competed for binding the original S isolate bound differentially to S variants, suggesting the protective importance of otherwise-redundant recognition.

417,Tocilizumab efficacy in COVID-19 patients is associated with respiratory severity-based stages,"BackgroundTocilizumab treatment is investigated, and effectiveness in ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients has been reported. Although controversy exists regarding the efficacy of tocilizumab treatment, it has been suggested that tocilizumab might show positive results depending on patient severity status. We examined an association between tocilizumab and distinct disease severity stages.

Methods and FindingsFrom March 3 to March 23 2020, 494 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients received tocilizumab or standard treatment alone. Data were obtained retrospectively. Clinical respiratory severity (CRS) stages were defined by patient oxygenation status and were also associated to scores of WHO clinical progression scale. We categorized patients in three stages, mild/moderate CRS1 (FiSpO2<0.35; WHO score 5), moderate/severe CRS2 (FiO2=0.5/high flow mask; WHO score 6) and severe/critical CRS3 (FiO2<80%/high flow/prone position or mechanical ventilation; score>6). The primary outcome was the composite of death or ICU admission in patients of stages CRS1, CRS2, and CRS3, as well as in total patients. We also addressed mortality alone in total patients. Kaplan-Maier curves, Cox proportional regression and inverse probability weighting marginal structural models were used. We conducted the study from March 3 to April 7 2020 with broad-ranged severity patients; 167 tocilizumab-treated and 327 untreated. CRS1 patients showed no apparent benefit after treatment, while the risk of the primary outcome was greatly reduced in CRS2 treated participants ((HR=0.22; 95% CI (0.16-0.44)). Moreover, tocilizumab treatment was associated with significantly decreased CRS2 patient proportion that reached the outcome compared to non-treated controls (27.8.0% vs. 65.4%; p<0.001). Severe/critical CRS3 patients, also showed benefit after treatment (HR=0.38; 95% CI (0.16-90)), although not as robust as was that of CRS2 treated individuals. Tocilizumab was associated with reduced outcome risk in total patients (HR=0.42; 95% CI (0.26-0.66)) after CRS adjustment, but not if CRS classification was not accounted as confounding factor (HR=1.19; 95% CI (0.84-1.69)).

ConclusionsTocilizumab treatment is associated with reduced COVID-19 escalation in CRS2 patients, suggesting efficacy in moderate/severe non-ICU-admitted patients.

418,Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland,"In December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant [1, 2, 3].

In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale.

Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirical confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently.

In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK. Our plots are available online and constantly updated with new data to closely monitor the changes in absolute numbers.",Chaoran Chen; Sarah Ann Nadeau; Ivan Topolsky; Marc Manceau; Jana S.

The purpose of the present work is to elaborate a hierarchical landscape of the current status of phase 3 vaccines, taking into account their attributes of technological platform, safety and efficacy. The methodology used was that of conceptual knowledge representation, resulting in, firstly, an appropriate classification of stage 3 vaccines, The Conceptual Lattice for COVID-19 vaccines, constructed according to how they relate to each other with respect to the set of their attributes.

421,Performance and Operational Evaluation of the Access Bio CareStart Rapid Antigen Test in a High-throughput Drive-through Community Testing Site in Massachusetts,"BackgroundTo facilitate deployment of point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated the Access Bio CareStart COVID-19 Antigen test in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site using anterior nasal (AN) swab RT-PCR for clinical testing.

MethodsConsenting symptomatic and asymptomatic children ([&le;]18 years) and adults received dual AN swabs. CareStart testing was performed with temperature/humidity monitoring. All tests had two independent reads to assess inter-operator agreement. Patients with positive CareStart results were called and instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations.

ResultsOf 1603 participants, 1245 adults and 253 children had paired RT-PCR/CareStart results and complete symptom data. 83% of adults and 87% of children were asymptomatic. CareStart sensitivity/specificity were 84.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.1-93.7)/97.2% (92.0-99.4) and 85.7% (42.1-99.6)/89.5% (66.9-98.7) in adults and children, respectively, within 5 days of symptoms. Sensitivity/specificity were 50.0% (41.0-59.0)/99.1% (98.3-99.6) in asymptomatic adults and 51.4% (34.4-68.1)/97.8% (94.5-99.4) in asymptomatic children.

A cross-sectional study was carried out which participated emerging adult students of a Colombian university. A total of 1,136 students between 18 and 29 years (M= 22.0, SD = 3.0); most of them were female (66.0%), non-health students (82.8%), low-income (79.0%), and residents of urban areas (84.9%). It was frequent low institutional trust (74.8%), low cognitive, social capital (27.9%), low fear of COVID-19 (49.5%), low perceived stress related to COVID-19 (83.5%), and high COVID-19 vaccine distrust (78.9%). Non-health carrier (Adjusted OR = 3.63, 95%CI 2.58-5.10), rural residence (AOR = 1.85, 95%CI 1.13-3.04), low income (AOR = 1.84, 95%CI 1.31-2.57), and perceived stress related to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.74, 95%CI 1.20-2.54) were related to high COVID-19 vaccine distrust.

425,COVID-19 risk score as a public health tool to guide targeted testing: A demonstration study in Qatar,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to develop a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk score to guide targeted RT-PCR testing in Qatar.

MethodsThe Qatar national COVID-19 testing database was analyzed. This database includes a total of 2,688,232 RT-PCR tests conducted between February 5, 2020-January 27, 2021. Logistic regression analyses were implemented to identify predictors of infection and to derive the COVID-19 risk score, as a tool to identify those at highest risk of having the infection. Score cut-off was determined using the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve based on maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. The scores performance diagnostics were assessed.

ResultsLogistic regression analysis identified age, sex, and nationality as significant predictors of infection and were included in the risk score. The scores scoring points were lower for females compared to males and higher for specific nationalities. The ROC curve was generated and the area under the curve was estimated at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.63-0.63). The score had a sensitivity of 59.4% (95% CI: 59.1%-59.7%), specificity of 61.1% (95% CI: 61.1%-61.2%), a positive predictive value of 10.9% (95% CI: 10.8%-10.9%), and a negative predictive value of 94.9% (94.9%-95.0%). The risk score derived early in the epidemic, based on data until only April 21, 2020, had a performance comparable to that of a score based on a year-long testing.

426,Categorizing the Status of COVID-19 Outbreaks Around the World,"Although the SARS-CoV-19 virus spread rapidly around in world in early 2020, disease epidemics in different places evolved differently as the year progressed - and the state of the COVID-19 pandemic now varies significantly across different countries and territories. We have created a taxonomy of possible categories of disease dynamics, and used the evolution of reported COVID-19 cases relative to changes in disease control measures, together with total reported cases and deaths, to allocate most countries and territories among the possible categories. As of 31 January 2021, we find that the disease was (1) kept out or suppressed quickly through quarantines and testing & tracing in 39 countries with 29 million people, (2) suppressed on one or more occasions through control measures in 74 countries with 2.49 billion people, (3) spread slowly but not suppressed, with cases still increasing or just past a peak, in 31 countries with 1.45 billion people, (4) spread through the population, but slowed a result of control measures, leading to a ""flattened curve"" and fewer infections than if the epidemic were unmitigated, in 32 countries with 2.24 billion people, and (5) spread through the population with some but limited mitigation in 5 countries with 168 million people. In addition, several countries have experienced increases in cases after disease appeared to have finished spreading due to declining numbers of susceptible people. For some of these countries - for example Kenya, Pakistan and Afghanistan - the resurgences can be explained by the relaxation of control measures (and may have been enhanced by disease spread in population segments that experienced lower infection levels during the first waves). For other countries, the resurgences point to the effects of new virus variants with higher transmissibility or immunity resistance - including most countries in Southern Africa (where the B.1.351 variant has been identified) and several countries in West Africa (potentially due to the B.1.1.7 or other variants). These findings are consistent with mounting evidence of high infection rates in several low- and middle-income countries, both from seroprevalence studies and estimates of actual deaths from COVID-19 combined with estimates of expected mortality rates. We estimate that 1.3-3.0 billion people, or 17-39% of the global population, have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 to date, and that at least 4.5 million people have died from COVID-19 - much higher than reported cases and deaths. Disease control policies and vaccination strategies should be designed based on the state of the COVID-19 epidemic in the population - and consequently may need to be different in different countries.",John Paul Callan; Carlijn J.

427,A quantitative risk estimation platform for indoor aerosol transmission of COVID-19,"Aerosol transmission has played a significant role in the transmission of COVID-19 disease worldwide. We developed a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation platform to better understand how key parameters associated with indoor spaces and infector emissions affect inhaled deposited dose of aerosol particles that convey the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The model calculates the concentration of size-resolved, virus-laden aerosol particles in well-mixed indoor air challenged by emissions from an index case(s). The model uses a mechanistic approach, accounting for particle emission dynamics, particle deposition to indoor surfaces, ventilation rate, and single-zone filtration. The novelty of this model relates to the concept of ""inhaled & deposited dose"" in the respiratory system of receptors linked to a dose-response curve for human coronavirus HCoV-229E. We estimated the volume of inhaled & deposited dose of particles in the 0.5 to 4 m range expressed in picoliters (pL) in a well-documented COVID-19 outbreak in restaurant X in Guangzhou China. We anchored the attack rate with the dose-response curve of HCoV-229E which provides a preliminary estimate of the average SARS-CoV-2 dose per person, expressed in plaque forming units (PFUs). For a reasonable emission scenario, we estimate approximately three PFU per pL deposited, yielding roughly 10 PFUs deposited in the respiratory system of those infected in Restaurant X. To explore the platforms utility, we tested the model with four COVID-19 outbreaks. The risk estimates from the model fit reasonably well with the reported number of confirmed cases given available metadata from the outbreaks and uncertainties associated with model assumptions.

Practical ImplicationsThe model described in this paper is more mechanistic in nature than standard probabilistic models that fail to account for particle deposition to indoor materials, filtration, and deposition of particles in the respiratory system of receptors. As such, it provides added insights into how building-related factors affect relative infection risk associated with inhaled deposited dose. An online version of this mechanistic aerosol risk estimation platform is available at Safeairspaces.com.

428,"Effectiveness of a telerehabilitation program for COVID-19 survivors (TERECO) on exercise capacity, pulmonary function, lower limb muscle strength, and quality of life: a randomised controlled trial","ObjectivesTo investigate superiority of a telerehabilitation program for Covid-19 (TERECO) over no rehabilitation with regard to functional exercise capacity, lower-limb muscle strength (LMS), pulmonary function, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and perceived dyspnoea.

DesignParallel-group randomised controlled-trial with 1:1 block-randomisation.

SettingThree major hospitals from Jiangsu and Hubei provinces, China.

Participants120 Covid-19 survivors with modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score of 2-3 who had been discharged from hospital were randomised. 61 were allocated to the control group and 59 to the TERECO group.

InterventionThe control group received educational instructions. The TERECO group participated in a 6-week home-based, pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered via smartphone and monitored with chest-worn heart rate telemetry. Exercise types comprised breathing control and thoracic expansion, aerobic exercise, and LMS exercise.

OutcomesPrimary outcome was 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) in metres. Secondary outcomes were LMS measured as squat time in seconds; pulmonary function assessed by spirometry with parameters being forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), and peak expiratory flow; HRQOL measured with SF-12 physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS); and mMRC dyspnoea, favourable outcome (no dyspnoea). Outcomes were assessed at 6 weeks (post-treatment) and 28 weeks (follow-up).

Results120 patients were randomised, 15 (12.5%) were lost to follow-up at study endpoint. No serious adverse events occurred. 38 participants in the TERECO group complied with the exercise protocol (64.41% of randomized). The adjusted between-group difference in change in 6MWD from baseline was 65.45 metres (95% CI 43.8-87.1, p<0.001) at post-treatment and 68.62 metres (95% CI 46.39-90.85, p<0.001) at follow-up. Treatment effects for LMS were 20.12 seconds (95% CI 12.34-27.9, p<0.001) post-treatment and 22.23 seconds (95% CI 14.24-30.21, p<0.001) at follow-up. No group differences were found for lung function apart from post-treatment MVV (10.57 litres/minute, 95% CI 0.26-17.88, p=0.005). Increase in SF-12 PCS was greater in the TERECO group with treatment effects estimated as 3.79 (95% CI 1.24-6.35, p=0.004) at post-treatment and 2.69 (95% CI 0.06-5.32, p=0.045) at follow-up. No significant between-group differences were found for improvements in SF-12 MCS. At post-treatment 90.4% endorsed a favourable outcome for mMRC dyspnoea in the TERECO group vs. 61.7% in control (adjusted RR 1.46, 1.17-1.82, p=0.001).

ConclusionsThis trial demonstrated superiority of TERECO over no rehabilitation for 6MWD, LMS, and SF-12 PCS. We found no persistent effects on pulmonary function, SF-12 MCS, and perceived dyspnoea.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSWhat is already knownC_ST_ABSMany Covid-19 survivors discharged from hospital have reduced exercise capacity, impaired pulmonary function, muscle weakness, and reduced quality of life, all of which might be addressed with pulmonary rehabilitation.

However, evidence on effective pulmonary rehabilitation measures for this population is currently lacking. As delivery of conventional rehabilitation services is furthermore limited due to pandemic control measures, telerehabilitation programs represent a possible alternative.

What the study addsWe developed a telerehabilitation program for Covid-19 survivors (TERECO program) that is delivered via smartphone and can be carried out at home.

Our study suggests that TERECO was safe and participants of the TERECO program had improved exercise capacity, lower-limb muscle strength, and physical quality of life. No relevant group differences were found for lung function, self-reported breathlessness, and mental quality of life.

The TERECO program is inexpensive and could be implemented on a large scale to improve physical health of Covid-19 survivors after discharge from hospital.",Jian'an Li; Wenguang Xia; Chao Zhan; Shouguo Liu; Zhifei Yin; Jiayue Wang; Yufei Chong; Chanjuan Zheng; Xiaoming Fang; Wei Cheng; Jan D.

We illustrate our approach on data from child immunization campaigns for seven non-mandatory vaccines carried out in 6408 Italian municipalities in 2016. A battery of machine learning models is compared in terms of area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. We find that the Random Forest algorithm best predicts areas with a high risk of VH improving the unpredictable baseline level by 24% in terms of accuracy. Among the area-level indicators, the proportion of waste recycling and the employment rate are found to be the most powerful predictors of high VH.

To compare scales of efficacy LFDs are compared to other non-pharmacological interventions. We find that, although tests can be used to reduce disease incidence, investments in personal protective equipment (e.g. masks) and increasing ventilation quality in enclosed environments is more effective in lowering disease prevalence.",Joshua W Moore; Zechariah Lau; Katerina Kaouri; Trevor C Dale; Thomas E Woolley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253122,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253122,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,True
431,The plasmablast response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is dominated by non-neutralizing antibodies that target both the NTD and the RBD,"In this study we profiled vaccine-induced polyclonal antibodies as well as plasmablast derived mAbs from subjects who received SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccine. Polyclonal antibody responses in vaccinees were robust and comparable to or exceeded those seen after natural infection. However, that the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was greater than that after natural infection and, at the monoclonal level, we found that the majority of vaccine-induced antibodies did not have neutralizing activity. We also found a co-dominance of mAbs targeting the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike and an original antigenic-sin like backboost to seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins. Neutralizing activity of NTD mAbs but not RBD mAbs against a clinical viral isolate carrying E484K as well as extensive changes in the NTD was abolished, suggesting that a proportion of vaccine induced RBD binding antibodies may provide substantial protection against viral variants carrying E484K.",Fatima Amanat; Mahima Thapa; Tingting Lei; Shaza M.

432,SARS-COV-2 antibody prevalence in patients on dialysis in the US in January 2021,"BackgroundTo estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the US, the country with the worlds largest absolute numbers of COVID19 cases and deaths, we conducted a cross-sectional assessment from a sample of patients receiving dialysis in January 2021.

MethodsWe tested remainder plasma of 21,424 patients receiving dialysis through the third-largest US dialysis organization, with facilities located nationwide. We used the Siemens spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody assay to estimate crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and then estimated seroprevalence for the US dialysis and adult population by standardizing by age, sex and region. We also compared January 2021 seroprevalence and case-detection rates to that from a similar subsample of patients receiving dialysis who had been tested in July 2020.

ResultsPatients in the sample were disproportionately from older age and minority race/ethnic groups. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 18.9% (95% CI: 18.3-19.5%) in the sample, 18.7% (18.1-19.2%) standardized to the US dialysis population, and 21.3% (20.3-22.3%) standardized to the US adult population (range 15.3-20.8% in the Northeast and South respectively). Younger age groups (18-44 years), and persons self-identifying as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods, and persons living in the poorest neighborhoods were among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence (25.9% (24.1-27.8%), 25.1% (23.6-26.4%), 24.8% (23.2-26.5%) respectively). Compared to data from July 2020, we observed diminished variability in seroprevalence by geographic region and urban-rural status. Estimated case detection rate increased from 14% to 23% in July 2020 to January 2021.

ConclusionsA year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the US, fewer than one in four adults have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Vaccine roll out to majority minority neighborhoods and poorer neighborhoods will be critical to disrupting the spread of infection.

433,"Single-Arm, Open-Label Phase 2 Trial of Preemptive Methylprednisolone to Avert Progression to Respiratory Failure in High-Risk Patients with COVID-19","IntroductionCovid-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by a viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until seven days later. This is followed by a second and third phase, initially characterized by the appearance of lung infiltrates, followed in 20% by respiratory failure. The second phase is usually heralded by an elevation of serologic inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, IL-6, LDH as well as D-dimers. Approximately 20% proceed to the second phase and are usually then treated with dexamethasone, provided they are oxygen-dependent since these are the only cases that benefit from dexamethasone. If we had objective criteria to predict this 20% that develop severe illness, they could preemptively be treated with steroids. In this exploratory study we investigated the early use of preemptive steroids in the setting of early disease, in high-risk non-oxygen dependent cases.

MethodsEligible patients were those 21 years or older with a diagnosis of Covid-19 and oxygen saturation [&ge;]91%. For patients to be classified as high-risk, they had to exhibit two or more of the following abnormalities 7-10 days after first symptom: IL-6 [&ge;] 10 pg/ml, ferritin > 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L (1,000 ng/ml), CRP > 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L), LDH above normal range lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count <1,000 /{micro}L), oxygen saturation between 91-94%, or CT chest with evidence of ground glass infiltrates. Primary endpoint was progression to respiratory failure. CALL score method was used to predict the expected number of cases of respiratory failure. High risk patients received methylprednisolone (MPS) 80 mg IV daily x 5 days starting no earlier than seven days from first onset of symptoms. The primary endpoint was progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure defined as PaO2 <60 mm Hg or oxygen saturation [&le;]90%. Secondary endpoints included survival at 28 days from registration, admission to intensive care and live discharge from the hospital. Change in levels of inflammatory markers and length of hospitalization were also assessed.

ResultsIn 76 patients, the expected number with respiratory failure was 30 (39.5%), yet only 4 (5.3%) developed that complication (p=.00001). Survival at 28 days was 98.6%.

Improvement in inflammatory markers correlated with favorable outcome.

434,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children attending school. Interim report on an observational, longitudinal sampling study of infected children, contacts, and the environment","BackgroundTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and young people in school settings has not been directly evaluated, nor the main mechanisms of transmission identified. The study set out to undertake sequential longitudinal sampling of infected children, their contacts, and the environment.

MethodsCases of COVID-19 were identified through statutory notification and matched to schools reporting cases. Cases of COVID-19 and their contacts from school and home were longitudinally sampled and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Surfaces and air in the home and school environment were also subject to longitudinal sampling and testing.

ResultsOnward transmission of virus to immediate classroom members who participated in the study was not detected. Evidence of more widespread transmission among children remaining in school was not identified with the exception of one unexpected cluster of three asymptomatic cases in one school. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in this study shed viral RNA for up to 10 days from symptom onset, with levels peaking at 5-8 days. Viral RNA was identified in the environment around children who were actively shedding virus in the home, but limited contamination was identified in schools. Variant of Concern B1.1.7 was identified in later cases studied.

SummaryAfter 3 months, this small study has not found evidence to suggest COVID-19 is commonly transmitted by children within schools. A minority of infections may be subject to stochastic events that can lead to transmission. Further prospective and retrospective studies are required to identify factors associated with such events.",Rebecca Cordery; Lucy Reeves; Jie Zhou; Aileen G.

435,Vaccine effectiveness after 1st and 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in long-term care facility residents and healthcare workers - a Danish cohort study,"BackgroundAt the end of 2020, Denmark launched an immunization program against SARS-CoV-2. The Danish health authorities prioritized persons currently living in long-term care facilities (LTCF residents) and frontline healthcare workers (HCW) as the first receivers of vaccination. Here we present preliminary population based vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates in these two target groups.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective registry- and population-based observational cohort study including all LTCF residents and all HWC. The outcome was a polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and VE was estimated for different periods following first and second dose. We used Poisson and Cox regressions to estimate respectively crude and calendar time-adjusted VE for the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for vaccinated versus unvaccinated.

ResultsA total of 39,040 LTCF residents (median age at first dose; 84 years, Interquartile range (IQR): 77-90) and 331,039 HCW (median age at first dose; 47 years, IQR: 36-57) were included. Among LTCF residents, 95.2% and 86.0% received first and second dose from 27 December 2020 until 18 February 2021, for HWC the proportion was 27.8% and 24.4%. During a median follow-up of 53 days, there were 488 and 5,663 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the unvaccinated groups, whereas there were 57 and 52 in LTCF residents and HCW within the first 7 days after the second dose and 27 and 10 cases beyond seven days of second dose. No protective effect was observed for LTCF residents after first dose. In HCW, VE was 17% (95% CI; 4-28) in the > 14 days after first dose (before second dose). Furthermore, the VE in LTCF residents at day 0-7 of second dose was 52% (95% CI; 27-69) and 46% (95% CI; 28-59) in HCW. Beyond seven days of second dose, VE increased to 64% (95% CI; 14-84) and 90% (95% CI; 82-95) in the two groups, respectively.

ConclusionThe results were promising regarding the VE both within and beyond seven days of second vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine currently used in many countries to help mitigate the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Impact of the researchSo far, observational studies of the real-word effectiveness of the mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has been limited to the period after the administration of the first dose. This is the first report to date to present vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates after the second BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine. We estimated a VE of 52% and 46% in LTCF residents and HCW within seven days, which increased to 64% and 90% in the two groups respectively beyond seven days of immunization.

436,Beliefs about Mask Efficacy and the Effect of Social Norms on Mask Wearing Intentions for COVID-19 Risk Reduction,"In the absence of widespread vaccination for COVID-19, governments and public health officials have advocated for the public to wear masks during the pandemic. The decision to wear a mask in public is likely affected by both beliefs about its efficacy and the prevalence of the behavior. Greater mask use in the community may encourage others to follow this norm, but it also creates an incentive for individuals to free ride on the protection afforded to them by others. We report the results of two vignette-based experiments conducted in the United States and Italy to examine the causal relationship between beliefs, social norms, and reported intentions to engage in mask promoting behavior. We find that providing factual information about how masks protect others increases the likelihood that someone would wear a mask or encourage others to do so in the United States, but not in Italy. There is no effect of providing information about how masks protect the wearer in either country. Additionally, greater mask use increases intentions to wear a mask and encourage someone else to wear theirs properly in both the United States and Italy. Thus, community mask use may be self-reinforcing.",Scott E Bokemper; Maria Cucciniello; Tiziano E Rotesi; Paolo Pin; Amyn A Malik; Kathryn Willebrand; Elliott E Paintsil; Saad B Omer; Gregory A Huber; Alessia Melegaro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252722,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252722,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,True
437,Spike mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants confer resistance to antibody neutralization,"New SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge from the current global pandemic, some of which can replicate faster and with greater transmissibility and pathogenicity. In particular, UK501Y.V1 identified in UK, SA501Y.V2 in South Africa, and BR501Y.V3 in Brazil are raising serious concerns as they spread quickly and contain spike protein mutations that may facilitate escape from current antibody therapies and vaccine protection. Here, we constructed a panel of 28 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses bearing single or combined mutations found in the spike protein of these three variants, as well as additional nine mutations that within or close by the major antigenic sites in the spike protein identified in the GISAID database. These pseudoviruses were tested against a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including some approved for emergency use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, and convalescent patient plasma collected early in the pandemic. SA501Y.V2 pseudovirus was the most resistant, in magnitude and breadth, against mAbs and convalescent plasma, followed by BR501Y.V3, and then UK501Y.V1. This resistance hierarchy corresponds with Y144del and 242-244del mutations in the N-terminal domain as well as K417N/T, E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD). Crystal structural analysis of RBD carrying triple K417N-E484K-N501Y mutations found in SA501Y.V2 bound with mAb P2C-1F11 revealed a molecular basis for antibody neutralization and escape. SA501Y.V2 and BR501Y.V3 also acquired substantial ability to use mouse and mink ACE2 for entry. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate major antigenic shifts and potentially broadening the host range of SA501Y.V2 and BR501Y.V3, which pose serious challenges to our current antibody therapies and vaccine protection.",Ruoke Wang; Qi Zhang; Jiwan Ge; Wenlin Ren; Riu Zhang; Jun Lan; Bin Ju; Bin Su; Fengting Yu; Peng Chen; Huiyu Liao; Yingmei Feng; Xuemei Li; Xuanling Shi; Zheng Zhang; Fujie Zhang; Qiang Ding; Tong Zhang; Xinquan Wang; Linqi Zhang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434497,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434497,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
438,The N501Y spike substitution enhances SARS-CoV-2 transmission,"Beginning in the summer of 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in the United Kingdom (UK). This B.1.1.7 variant increased rapidly in prevalence among sequenced strains, attributed to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency. The UK variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 UK spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant responsible for increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil and South Africa, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.",Yang Liu; Jianying Liu; Kenneth S.

439,Systemic Tissue and Cellular Disruption from SARS-CoV-2 Infection revealed in COVID-19 Autopsies and Spatial Omics Tissue Maps,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has infected over 115 million people and caused over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, as well as what distinguishes them from common seasonal influenza virus and other lung injury states such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), remains poorly understood. To address these challenges, we combined transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues, matched with spatial protein and expression profiling (GeoMx) across 357 tissue sections. These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. In particular, cardiac and lung tissues revealed the largest degree of splicing isoform switching and cell expression state loss. Overall, these findings reveal a systemic disruption of cellular and transcriptional pathways from COVID-19 across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19, as well to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viruses.",Jiwoon Park; Jonathan Foox; Tyler Hether; David Danko; Sarah Warren; Youngmi Kim; Jason Reeves; Danel J Butler; Christopher Mozsary; Joel Rosiene; Alon Shaiber; Ebrahim Afshinnekoo; Matthew MacKay; Yaron Bram; Vasuretha Chandar; Heather Geiger; Arryn Craney; Priya Velu; Ari M Melnick; Iman Hajirasouliha; Afshin Beheshti; Amanda Saravia-Butler; Eve Syrkin Wurtele; Jonathan Schisler; Samantha Fenessey; Andre Corvelo; Michael C Zody; Soren Germer; Steven Salvatore; Shawn Levy; Shixiu Wu; Nicholas Tatonetti; Sagi Shapira; Mirella Salvatore; Massimo Loda; Lars F Westblade; Melissa Cushing; Hanna Rennert; Alison J Kriegel; Olivier Elemento; Marcin Imielinski; Alain C Borczuk; Cem Meydan; Robert E Schwartz; Christopher E Mason,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434433,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434433,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
440,Quantitative proteomics of hamster lung tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 reveal host-factors having implication in the disease pathogenesis and severity,"Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) manifests lung pathology that resembles human COVID-19 patients. In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARS-CoV-2 isolate in hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute infection and convalescence. The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate in vivo. Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples shows a similar type of pathophysiological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection as reported earlier in COVID-19 patients and hamsters infected with other isolates. The lung-associated pathological changes were very prominent on the 4th day post-infection (dpi), mostly resolved by 14dpi. Here, we carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at day 4 and day 14 post infection. This resulted in the identification of 1,585 differentially expressed proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered among both the infected groups. Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet activation, ferroptosis and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways. In addition, we also identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins (Sftpd and Sftpb), known for their protective role in lung function. Together, these findings will aid in the identification of candidate biomarkers and understanding the mechanism(s) involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

441,In vitro rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by visible light photocatalysis using boron-doped bismuth oxybromide,"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and on surfaces is critical to prevent the fecal-oral and fomite transmission, respectively. We hypothesized that visible light active photocatalysts could dramatically enhance the rate or extent of virus inactivation and enable the use of visible light rather than shorter wavelength ultraviolet light. A novel visible light active photocatalyst, boron-doped bismuth oxybromide (B-BiOBr), was synthesized and tested for its SARS-CoV-2 inactivation towards Vero E6 cell lines in dark and under irradiation at 426 nm by a light emitting diode (LED) in water. SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence of B-BiOBr (0.8 g/L) under LED irradiation reached 5.32-log in 5 min, which was 400 to 10,000 times higher than those achieved with conventional photocatalysts of tungsten or titanium oxide nanomaterials, respectively. Even without LED irradiation, B-BiOBr inactivated 3.32-log of SARS-CoV-2 in the dark due to the ability of bismuth ions interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase function. LED irradiation at 426 nm alone, without the photocatalyst, contributed to 10% of the observed inactivation and was attributed to production of reactive oxygen species due to blue-light photoexcitation of molecules in the culture media, which opens further modes of action to engineer disinfection strategies. The visible light active B-BiOBr photocatalyst, with its rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence and absence of light, holds tremendous opportunities to build a healthy environment by preventing the fecal-oral and fomite transmission of emerging pathogens.",Li Ling; Tea Carletti; Zihang Cheng; Ruixuan Wang; Yanxiao Ren; Paul Westerhoff; Chii Shang; Alessandro Marcello; Shuyu Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434359,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434359,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
442,A recombinant ACE2 Triple Decoy that traps and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 shows enhanced affinity for highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants,"The highly-transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants now replacing the first wave strain pose an increased threat to human health by their ability, in some instances, to escape existing humoral protection conferred by previous infection, neutralizing antibodies, and possibly vaccination. Thus, other therapeutic options are necessary. One such therapeutic option that leverages SARS-CoV-2 initiation of infection by binding of its spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) to surface-expressed host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE2  decoy that would trap the virus by competitive binding and thus inhibit propagation of infection. Here, we used Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to predict ACE2 mutations that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened these candidates for binding affinity in vitro. A double mutant ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein was found to have very high affinity for S RBD and to show greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay as compared to wild type ACE2. We further modified the double mutant ACE2 decoy by addition of an H374N mutation to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity while maintaining high S RBD affinity. We then confirmed the potential efficacy of our ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC Triple Decoy against S RBD expressing variant-associated E484K, K417N, N501Y, and L452R mutations and found that our ACE2 Triple Decoy not only maintains its high affinity for S RBD expressing these mutations, but shows enhanced affinity for S RBD expressing the N501Y or L452R mutations and the highest affinity for S RBD expressing both the E484K and N501Y mutations. The ACE2 Triple Decoy also demonstrates the ability to compete with wild type ACE2 in the cPass surrogate virus neutralization in the presence of S RBD with these mutations. Additional MD simulation of ACE2 WT and decoy interactions with S RBD WT or B.1.351 variant sequence S RBD provides insight into the enhanced affinity of the ACE2 decoy for S RBD and reveals its potential as a tool to predict affinity and inform therapeutic design. The ACE2 Triple Decoy is now undergoing continued assessment, including expression by a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) construct to facilitate delivery in vivo.

Summary sentenceAn ACE2(N27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC fusion protein decoy sustains high affinity to all SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein variants tested, shows enhanced affinity for the N501Y and L452R variants, and the highest affinity for combined N501Y and E484K variants.",Shiho Tanaka; Gard Nelson; Anders Olson; Oleksandr Buzko; Wendy Higashide; Annie Shin; Marcos Gonzales; Justin Taft; Roosheel Sandeep Patel; Sofija Buta; Marta Martin-Fernandez; Dusan Sandeep Bogunovic; Patricia R Spilman; Kayvan Niazi; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Patrick Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434641,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434641,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
443,COVIDrugNet: a network-based web tool to investigate the drugs currently in clinical trial to contrast COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge problem of public health that requires the implementation of all available means to contrast it, and drugs are one of them. In this context, we observed an unmet need of depicting the continuously evolving scenario of the ongoing drug clinical trials through an easy-to-use, freely accessible online tool. Starting from this consideration, we developed COVIDrugNet (http://compmedchem.unibo.it/covidrugnet), a web application that allows users to capture a holistic view and keep up to date on how the clinical drug research is responding to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

444,The FDA-approved drug cobicistat synergizes with remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication,"Combinations of direct-acting antivirals are needed to minimize drug-resistance mutations and stably suppress replication of RNA viruses. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and testing of a number of drug regimens has led to conflicting results. Here we show that cobicistat, which is an-FDA approved drug-booster that blocks the activity of the drug metabolizing proteins Cytochrome P450-3As (CYP3As) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Cell-to-cell membrane fusion assays indicated that the antiviral effect of cobicistat is exerted through inhibition of spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. In line with this, incubation with low micromolar concentrations of cobicistat decreased viral replication in three different cell lines including cells of lung and gut origin. When cobicistat was used in combination with the putative CYP3A target and nucleoside analog remdesivir, a synergistic effect on the inhibition of viral replication was observed in cell lines and in a primary human colon organoid. The cobicistat/remdesivir combination was able to potently abate viral replication to levels comparable to mock-infected cells leading to an almost complete rescue of infected cell viability. These data highlight cobicistat as a therapeutic candidate for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a potential building block of combination therapies for COVID-19.",Iart Luca Shytaj; Mohamed Fares; Bojana Lucic; Lara Gallucci; Mahmoud M.

445,Site-specific steric control of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycosylation,"A central tenet in the design of vaccines is the display of native-like antigens in the elicitation of protective immunity. The abundance of N-linked glycans across the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a potential source of heterogeneity between the many different vaccine candidates under investigation. Here, we investigate the glycosylation of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins from five different laboratories and compare them against infectious virus S protein. We find patterns which are conserved across all samples and this can be associated with site-specific stalling of glycan maturation which act as a highly sensitive reporter of protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a fully glycosylated spike support s a model of steric restrictions that shape enzymatic processing of the glycans. These results suggest that recombinant spike-based SARS-CoV-2 immunogen glycosylation reproducibly recapitulates signatures of viral glycosylation.",Joel D Allen; Himanshi Chawla; Firdaus Samsudin; Lorena Zuzic; Aishwary Tukaram Shivgan; Yasunori Watanabe; Wan-Ting He; Sean Callaghan; Ge Song; Peter Yong; Philip J.M.

446,Post discharge persistent symptoms after COVID-19 in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases,"OBJECTIVESTo describe persistent symptoms and consequences in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) discharged from the hospital after Covid-19; to assess the roll of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) compared to and non-autoimmune rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (NARD) on persistent symptoms and consequences.

METHODSWe performed a cross-sectional observational study. RMD attended at a rheumatology outpatient clinic in Madrid with Covid-19 that required hospital admission were included. The main outcomes were persistence of symptoms and health consequences related to Covid19 after discharge. Independent variable was RMD group (ARD and NARD) and covariates were sociodemographic, clinical, and treatments. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the risk by RMD group on main outcomes.

RESULTSWe included 105 patients and 51.5% had ARD. 68.57% reported at least one persistent symptom. The most frequent were dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. 31 patients had consequences. Lung damage was found in 11.4% of the patients, 18% had blood test abnormalities (10% lymphopenia), two died, one developed central retinal vein occlusion and one patient developed optic neuritis. 11 patients required readmission due to Covid-19 problems (16.7% ARD vs 3.9% NARD; p=0.053). No statistically significant differences by RMD groups were found in the final models.

CONCLUSIONMany RMD patients have persistent symptoms, similar to other populations. This study also highlights that lung damage is the most frequent consequence. ARD compared to NARD does not seem to differ in terms of persistent symptoms or consequences, although ARD might have a greater number of readmissions due to Covid-19.",Leticia Leon; Ines Perez-Sancristobal; Alfredo Madrid; Leticia Lopez Pedraza; Jose Ignacio Colomer; Sergio Lerma; Pia Lois; Arkaitz Mucientes; Luis Rodriguez-Rodriguez; Lydia Abasolo; Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253120,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253120,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
447,COVID-19 vaccine response in pregnant and lactating women: a cohort study,"BackgroundPregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial COVID-19 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision-making are lacking. We sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women.

Methods131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131), umbilical cord sera (N=10), and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, 2nd vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post 2nd vaccine, and delivery by Luminex, and confirmed by ELISA. Titers were compared to pregnant women 4-12 weeks from native infection (N=37). Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups.

ResultsVaccine-induced immune responses were equivalent in pregnant and lactating vs non-pregnant women. All titers were higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, but not IgA, increased in maternal blood and breastmilk with vaccine boost. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection.

448,Exploration of interethnic variation and repurposed drug efficacy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19),"The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to repurposing of drugs, with little underlying evidence for treatment safety and efficacy. This may increase complications for patients with acute viral respiratory infections. UGT1A1 and CYP2D6 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of atazanavir and fluvoxamine repurposed for COVID-19. This study aimed to elucidate the role of interethnic variation in these enzymes in the efficacy of repurposed drug therapies. A retrospective cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. Comprehensive global population genetic structure analyses were performed for CYP2D6 and UGT1A1 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations of over 131,000 global subjects from 417 published reports, revealing that Jordanian Arabs share the closest sequence homology to European and Near East populations. The East Asian populations have significantly over-representaiton of individuals with diplotype pairs for reduced atazanavir metabolism compared to the African populations and are more likely to show impaired UGT1A1 metabolism. East Asian populations are also 4.4x more likely to show impaired fluvoxamine metabolism than South Central Asian and Oceanian populations, and 8x more likely than other ancestry populations. The results here support previous findings that interethnic variation should be used for developing proper population-specific dosage guidelines.",Ammar Ali Almarzooq,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21253095,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21253095,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
449,"SARS-CoV-2 infects blood monocytes to activate NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, pyroptosis and cytokine release","SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress that can progress to multiorgan failure and death in some patients. Although severe COVID-19 disease is linked to exuberant inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not understood. Monocytes are sentinel blood cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and processing and release of IL-1 family cytokines, potent inflammatory mediators. Here we show that ~10% of blood monocytes in COVID-19 patients are dying and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection, which depends on antiviral antibodies, activates NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and GSDMD cleavage and relocalization. Signs of pyroptosis (IL-1 family cytokines, LDH) in the plasma correlate with development of severe disease. Moreover, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) linked to higher GSDMD expression increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio, 1.3, p<0.005). These findings taken together suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of monocytes triggers inflammation that contributes to severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis.

450,A 1 to 1000 SARS-CoV-2 reinfection proportion in members of a large healthcare provider in Israel: a preliminary report,"With more than 100 million confirmed COVID-19 cases as of March 2021, reinfection is still considered to be rare. In light of increasing reports of reinfected COVID-19 patients, the need to better understand the real risk for reinfection is critical, with potential effects on public health policies aimed at containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this descriptive preliminary report, we conducted a large-scale assessment on the country level of the possible occurrence of COVID-19 reinfection within the members of a large healthcare provider in Israel. Out of 149,735 individuals with a documented positive PCR test between March 2020 and January 2021, 154 had two positive PCR tests at least 100 days apart, reflecting a reinfection proportion of 1 per 1000.

451,Persistence of symptoms up to 10 months following acute COVID-19 illness,"ImportanceCOVID-19 symptoms are increasingly recognized to persist among a subset of individual following acute infection, but features associated with this persistence are not well-understood.

ObjectiveWe aimed to identify individual features that predicted persistence of symptoms over at least 2 months at the time of survey completion.

Design: Non-probability internet survey. Participants were asked to identify features of acute illness as well as persistence of symptoms at time of study completion. We used logistic regression models to examine association between sociodemographic and clinical features and persistence of symptoms at or beyond 2 months.

SettingTen waves of a fifty-state survey between June 13, 2020 and January 13, 2021.

Participants6,211 individuals who reported symptomatic COVID-19 illness confirmed by positive test or clinician diagnosis.

Exposuresymptomatic COVID-19 illness

ResultsAmong 6,211 survey respondents reporting COVID-19 illness, with a mean age of 37.8 (SD 12.2) years and 45.1% female, 73.9% white, 10.0% Black, 9.9% Hispanic, and 3.1% Asian, a total of 4946 (79.6%) had recovered within less than 2 months, while 491 (7.9%) experienced symptoms for 2 months or more. Of the full cohort, 3.4% were symptomatic for 4 months or more and 2.2% for 6 months or more. In univariate analyses, individuals with persistent symptoms on average reported greater initial severity. In logistic regression models, older age was associated with greater risk of persistence (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19 for each decade beyond 40); otherwise, no significant associations with persistence were identified for gender, race/ethnicity, or income. Presence of headache was significantly associated with greater likelihood of persistence (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11-1.86), while fever was associated with diminished likelihood of persistence (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.83).

Conclusion and RelevanceA subset of individuals experience persistent symptoms from 2 to more than 10 months after acute COVID-19 illness, particularly those who recall headache and absence of fever. In light of this prevalence, strategies for predicting and managing such sequelae are needed.

In achieving this objective, this paper uses primary data collected from 1822 students and three different Likert scales and a one-way ANOVA test are used to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) scores and mean differences with respect to different variables. The research reveals that the majority of students have a higher level of knowledge and a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 guidelines. In contrary, only 0.22 percent students show strong compliance towards COVID-19 guidelines while majority students (60.54 percent) have rather a poor adherence which is an alarming finding. Reopening the educational institutions in Bangladesh is, therefore, not advisable yet and reinforcing the preventive measures through campaigns and online discussion to persuade people to follow the preventive guidelines is highly recommended to contain this global disease.

453,Development and pre-clinical evaluation of Newcastle disease virus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 intranasal vaccine candidate,"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of millions of people worldwide and threatens to become an endemic problem, therefore the need for as many types of vaccines as possible is of high importance.

Because of the millions of doses required, it is desirable that vaccines are not only safe and effective, but also easy to administer, store, and inexpensive to produce.

Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is responsible for a respiratory disease in chickens. It has no pathogenic homologue in humans. NDV is recognized as an oncolytic virus, and its use in humans for oncological treatment is being evaluated.

In the present work, we have developed two types of NDV-vectored candidate vaccines, which carry the surface-exposed RBD and S1 antigens of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. These vaccine candidates were produced in specific-pathogen-free embryonating chicken eggs, and purified from allantoic fluid before lyophilization. These vaccines were administered intranasally to three different animal models: mice, rats and hamsters, and evaluated for safety, toxicity, immunogenicity, stability and efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated in a challenge assay against active SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Golden Syrian hamster model.

The NDV-vectored vaccine based on the S1 antigen was shown to be safe and highly immunogenic, with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro, even with an extreme dilution of 1/640. Our results reveal that this vaccine candidate protects the lungs of the animals, preventing cellular damage in this tissue. In addition, this vaccine reduces the viral load in the lungs, suggesting that it may significantly reduce the likelihood of transmission. Being lyophilized, this vaccine candidate is very stable and can be stored for several months at 4-8C.

In conclusion, our NDV-based vaccine candidate has shown a very favorable performance in the pre-clinical study, serving as evidence for a future evaluation in a Phase-I human clinical trial. This candidate represents a promising tool in the fight against COVID-19.",Manolo Fernandez-Diaz; Katherine Calderon; Aldo Rojas-Neyra; Vikram N.

454,"Development of potency, breadth and resilience to viral escape mutations in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies","Antibodies elicited in response to infection undergo somatic mutation in germinal centers that can result in higher affinity for the cognate antigen. To determine the effects of somatic mutation on the properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, we analyzed six independent antibody lineages. As well as increased neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed pathways for acquisition of resistance and, in some cases, restricted the range of neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation apparently imposed a requirement for multiple spike mutations to enable escape. For certain antibody lineages, maturation enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD. These findings suggest that increasing antibody diversity through prolonged or repeated antigen exposure may improve protection against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 populations, and perhaps against other pandemic threat coronaviruses.",Frauke Muecksch; Yiska Weisblum; Christopher Barnes; Fabian Schmidt; Dennis Schaefer-Babajew; Julio Lorenzi; Andrew Flyak; Andrew DeLaitsch; Kathryn Huey-Tubman; Shurong Hou; Celia Schiffer; Christian Gaebler; Zijun Wang; Justin Da Silva; Daniel Poston; Shlomo Finkin; Alice Cho; Melissa Cipolla; Thiago Oliveira; Katrina Millard; Victor Ramos; Anna Gazumyan; Magdalena Rutkowska; Marina Caskey; Michel Nussenzweig; Pamela Bjorkman; Theodora Hatziioannou; Paul Bieniasz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434227,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434227,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False

456,"Drug development of an affinity enhanced, broadly neutralizing heavy chain only antibody that restricts SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters","We have identified camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs) that cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 and -2, such as VHH72, which binds to a unique highly conserved epitope in the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is difficult to access for human antibodies. Here, we establish a protein engineering path for how a stable, long-acting drug candidate can be generated out of such a VHH building block. When fused to human IgG1-Fc, the prototype VHH72 molecule prophylactically protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we demonstrate that both systemic and intranasal application protects hACE-2-transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 induced lethal disease progression. To boost potency of the lead, we used structure-guided molecular modeling combined with rapid yeast-based Fc-fusion prototyping, resulting in the affinity-matured VHH72_S56A-Fc, with subnanomolar SARS-CoV-1 and -2 neutralizing potency. Upon humanization, VHH72_S56A was fused to a human IgG1 Fc with optimized manufacturing homogeneity and silenced effector functions for enhanced safety, and its stability as well as lack of off-target binding was extensively characterized. Therapeutic systemic administration of a low dose of VHH72_S56A-Fc antibodies strongly restricted replication of both original and D614G mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hamsters, and minimized the development of lung damage. This work led to the selection of XVR011 for clinical development, a highly stable anti-COVID-19 biologic with excellent manufacturability.

457,Pediatric nasal epithelial cells are less permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication compared to adult cells,"RationaleYoung children (typically those <10 years old) are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms compared to adults. However, the mechanisms that underlie these age-dependent differences remain to be determined and could inform future therapeutics for adults.

ObjectiveTo contrast the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in primary nasal epithelial cells from adults and children.

MethodsViral replication was quantified by plaque assay. The cellular transcriptome of infected and uninfected cells was assessed by RNA-seq. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression were quantified by Western Blot.

Measurements and Main ResultsWe report significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 replication in adult compared to pediatric nasal epithelial cells. This was restricted to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the same phenomenon was not observed with influenza virus infection. The differentiational SARS-CoV-2 replication dynamics were associated with an elevated type I and III interferon response, and a more pronounced inflammatory response in pediatric cells. No significant difference between the two age groups was observed in the protein levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

ConclusionsOur data suggest that the innate immune response of pediatric nasal epithelial cells, and not differential receptor expression, may contribute to the reported reduced SARS-COV-2 infection and symptoms reported amongst children.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSThere is now a growing body of evidence that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults and if infected, children are more likely to develop an asymptomatic infection. The reasons for this remain unclear. In particular, the role of the pediatric nasal epithelium, the primary point of viral entry into the human host, in this differential susceptibility has yet to be investigated.

What This Study Adds to the FieldOur study indicates that pediatric nasal epithelial cells produce a more vigorous anti-viral and pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to adult cells. This is associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza virus, replication in pediatric epithelial cells. We also show that on a protein level SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression on nasal epithelial cells is not significantly different between children and adults.

459,A comparative recombination analysis of human coronaviruses and implications for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic prompts evaluation of recombination in human coronavirus (hCoV) evolution. We undertook recombination analyses of 158,118 public seasonal hCoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genome sequences using the RDP4 software. We found moderate evidence for 8 SARS-CoV-2 recombination events, two of which involved the spike gene, and low evidence for one SARS-CoV-1 recombination event. Within MERS-CoV, 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 datasets, we noted 7, 1, 9, 14, and 1 high-confidence recombination events, respectively. There was propensity for recombination breakpoints in structural genes, and recombination severely skewed the temporal structure of these data, especially for NL63 and OC43. Bayesian time-scaled analyses on recombinant-free data indicated the sampled diversity of seasonal CoVs emerged in the last 70 years, with 229E displaying continuous lineage replacements. These findings emphasize the importance of genomic based surveillance to detect recombination in SARS-CoV-2, particularly if recombination may lead to immune evasion.",Simon Pollett; Matthew A Conte; Mark A Sanborn; Richard G Jarman; Grace M Lidl; Kayvon Modjarrad; Irina Maljkovic Berry,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434287,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434287,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
460,Human nasal and lung tissues infected ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2 provide insights into differential tissue-specific and virus-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract,"The nasal-mucosa constitutes the primary entry site for respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here we employed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local-mucosal innate immune response in the authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with rapid increase in tissue-associated viral sub-genomic mRNA, and secretion of infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation of interferon stimulated genes, cytokines and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract, that are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. The studies shed light on the role of the nasal-mucosa in active viral transmission and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19.

IMPORTANCEIn order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tract. Here we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural multicellular complexity of human nasal-mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal-mucosal infection model can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes, and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory pathogens.",Or Alfi; Arkadi Yakirevich; Ori Wald; Ori Wandel; Uzi Izhar; Esther Oiknine-Djian; Yuval Nevo; Sharona Elgavish; Elad Dagan; Ory Madgar; Gilad Feinmesser; Eli Pikarsky; Michal Bronstein; Olesya Vorontsov; Wayne Jonas; John Ives; Joan Walter; Zichria Zakay-Rones; Menachem Oberbaum; Amos Panet; Dana G Wolf,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434404,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434404,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
461,SARS-CoV-2 evolution in animals suggests mechanisms for rapid variant selection,"SARS-CoV-2 spillback from humans into domestic and wild animals has been well-documented. We compared variants of cell culture-expanded SARS-CoV-2 inoculum and virus recovered from four species following experimental exposure. Five nonsynonymous changes in nsp12, S, N and M genes were near fixation in the inoculum, but reverted to wild-type sequences in RNA recovered from dogs, cats and hamsters within 1-3 days post-exposure. Fourteen emergent variants were detected in viruses recovered from animals, including substitutions at spike positions H69, N501, and D614, which also vary in human lineages of concern. The rapidity of in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 selection reveals residues with functional significance during host-switching, illustrating the potential for spillback reservoir hosts to accelerate evolution, and demonstrating plasticity of viral adaptation in animal models.

462,Sialic acid-Dependent Binding and Viral Entry of SARS-CoV-2,"Emerging evidence suggests that host glycans influence infection by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we reveal that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S)-protein on SARS-CoV-2 recognizes oligosaccharides containing sialic acid (SA), with preference for the oligosaccharide of monosialylated gangliosides. Gangliosides embedded within an artificial membrane also bind the RBD. The monomeric affinities (Kd = 100-200 M) of gangliosides for the RBD are similar to heparan sulfate, another negatively charged glycan ligand of the RBD proposed as a viral coreceptor. RBD binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus to ACE2-expressing cells is decreased upon depleting cell surface SA level using three approaches: sialyltransferase inhibition, genetic knock-out of SA biosynthesis, or neuraminidase treatment. These effects on RBD binding and pseudotyped viral entry are recapitulated with pharmacological or genetic disruption of glycolipid biosynthesis. Together, these results suggest that sialylated glycans, specifically glycolipids, facilitate viral entry of SARS-CoV-2.",Linh Nguyen; Kelli A McCord; Duong T Bui; Kim A Bouwman; Elena N Kitova; Dhanraj Kumawat; Gour C Daskan; Ilhan Tomris; Ling Han; Pradeep Chopra; Tzu-Jing Yang; Steven D Williows; Todd L Lowary; Lori J West; Shang-Te Danny Hsu; Stephen Mark Tompkins; Gert-Jan Boons; Andrew L Mason; Robert Paul de Vries; Matthew S Macauley; John S Klassen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434228,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434228,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
463,Comparative host interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 and human coronavirus homologs,"Human coronaviruses have become an increasing threat to global health; three highly pathogenic strains have emerged since the early 2000s, including most recently SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) dataset for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance nuclear protein important for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.",Katherine M Almasy; Jonathan P Davies; Lars Plate,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434440,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434440,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
464,Comparative studies of the seven human coronavirus envelope proteins using topology prediction and molecular modelling to understand their pathogenicity,"Human (h) coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are less virulent and cause mild, self-limiting respiratory tract infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are more virulent and have caused severe outbreaks. The CoV envelope (E) protein, an important contributor to the pathogenesis of severe hCoVs infections, may provide insight into this disparate severity of the disease. Topology prediction programs and 3D modelling software was used to predict and visualize structural aspects of the hCoV E protein related to its functions. All seven hCoV E proteins largely adopted different topologies, with some distinction between the more virulent and less virulent ones. The 3D models refined this distinction, showing the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 to be more flexible than the PBM of hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. We speculate that the increased flexibility of the PBM may provide the more virulent hCoVs with a greater degree of freedom, which can allow them to bind to different host proteins and can contribute to a more severe form of the disease. This is the first paper to predict the topologies and model 3D structures of all seven hCoVs E proteins, providing novel insights for possible drug and/or vaccine development.",Dewald Schoeman; Ruben Cloete; Burtram Fielding,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434384,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434384,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False

Whole genome sequencing revealed that the 33 samples under this lineage all contain the E484K, N501Y, and P681H Spike mutations previously found in variants of concern (VOC) such as the B.1.351, the P.1 and B.1.1.7 variants first reported in South Africa, Brazil, and the United Kingdom, respectively. The possible implications of the mutations found in the Spike protein of P.3 were analyzed for their potential effects on structure, stability, and molecular surface character. The analysis suggests that these mutations could significantly impact the possible interactions of the Spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and neutralizing antibodies, and warrants further clinical investigation. Some of the mutations affecting the N and C terminal domains may have effects on Spike monomer and trimer stability.

466,Identification of novel bat coronaviruses sheds light on the evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses,"Although a variety of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses have been identified, the evolutionary origins of this virus remain elusive. We describe a meta-transcriptomic study of 411 samples collected from 23 bat species in a small (~1100 hectare) region in Yunnan province, China, from May 2019 to November 2020. We identified coronavirus contigs in 40 of 100 sequencing libraries, including seven representing SARS-CoV-2-like contigs. From these data we obtained 24 full-length coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2 related and three SARS-CoV related genomes. Of these viruses, RpYN06 exhibited 94.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome and was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in the ORF1ab, ORF7a, ORF8, N, and ORF10 genes. The other three SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses were nearly identical in sequence and clustered closely with a virus previously identified in pangolins from Guangxi, China, although with a genetically distinct spike gene sequence. We also identified 17 alphacoronavirus genomes, including those closely related to swine acute diarrhea syndrome virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23 Rhinolophus bat species in Southeast Asia and southern China, with the largest contiguous hotspots extending from South Lao and Vietnam to southern China. Our study highlights both the remarkable diversity of bat viruses at the local scale and that relatives of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV circulate in wildlife species in a broad geographic region of Southeast Asia and southern China.

470,Self-reported real-world safety and reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines: An international vaccine-recipient survey.,"BackgroundThe safety of COVID-19 vaccines has been demonstrated in selected populations in recent studies, but more data in specific groups is needed to inform vaccine choice and health policy.

ObjectivesAn international, online survey was conducted to compare the safety, tolerability and reactogenicity of available COVID-19 vaccines in different recipient groups.

MethodsThis survey was launched in February 2021, for 11 days. Recipients of a first COVID-19 vaccine dose [&ge;]7 days prior to survey completion were eligible. The incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed.

ResultsSurvey was completed by 2,002 respondents, of whom 26.6% had prior COVID-19 infection (68.8% laboratory confirmed). Prior COVID-19 infection was associated with increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence intervals [1.05-1.11]), fever (2.24 [1.86-2.70]), breathlessness (2.05 [1.28-3.29]), flu-like illness (1.78 [1.51-2.10]), fatigue (1.34 [1.20-1.49]) and local reactions (1.10 [1.06-1.15]). It was also associated with increased risk of severe side effects, leading to hospital care (1.56 [1.14-2.12]).

While mRNA vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of any side effect (1.06 [1.01-1.11]) compared to viral vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p<0.001), mostly local reactions. Importantly, mRNA vaccine-recipients reported considerably lower incidence of systemic reactions (RR<0.6) including anaphylaxis, swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue, and of side effects requiring hospital care (0.42 [0.31-0.58]).

ConclusionFor the first time, our study links prior COVID-19 illness with increased incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mRNA vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects, but more local reactions.

Key messages- People with prior COVID-19 illness appear to experience significantly increased incidence and severity of side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
- In this first head-to-head comparison of the safety and reactogenicity of different types of vaccines, it was demonstrated that mRNA vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects, compared to viral vector vaccines, but more local reactions.

471,Recommendations for COVID-19 Vaccination in People with Rheumatic Disease: Developed by the Singapore Chapter of Rheumatologists,"AimPeople with rheumatic diseases (PRD) remain vulnerable in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD.

MethodsSystematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate (1) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (2) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (3) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology.

ResultsThe consensus comprises two overarching principles and seven recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommended that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.

472,"Measuring the exposure of Black, Asian and other ethnic groups to Covid-infected neighbourhoods in English towns and cities","Drawing on the work of The Doreen Lawrence Review - a report on the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in the UK - this paper develops an index of exposure, measuring which ethnic groups have been most exposed to Covid-19 infected residential neighbourhoods during the first and second waves of the pandemic in England. The index is based on a Bayesian Poisson model with a random intercept in the linear predictor, allowing for extra-Poisson variation at neighbourhood and town/city scales. This permits within-city differences to be decoupled from broader regional trends in the disease. The research finds that members of ethnic minority groups tend to be living in areas with higher infection rates but also that the risk of exposure is distributed unevenly across these groups. Initially, in the first wave, the disease disproportionately affected Black residents. As the pandemic has progressed, especially the Pakistani but also the Bangladeshi and Indian groups have had the highest exposure. This higher exposure of the Pakistani group is not straightforwardly a function of neighbourhood deprivation because it is present across a range of average house prices. However, we find evidence to support the view, expressed in The Doreen Lawrence Review, that it is linked to occupational and environmental exposure, particularly residential density.",Richard Harris; Chris Brunsdon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252893,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252893,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
473,Estimating the super-spreading rate at workplaces using bluetooth technology,"Workplaces deploy internal guidelines to remain operational during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is challenging to assess whether those interventions will prevent super-spreading events, where an infected individual transmits the disease to 10 or more secondary cases. Here we provide a model of infectious disease at the level of a workplace to address that problem. We take as input proximity contact records based on bluetooth technology and the infectious disease parameters from the literature. Using proximity contact data for a case-study workplace and an infection transmission model, we estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate as 0.014 per proximity contact, going up to 0.041 for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the UK. Defining super-spreading as events with 10 or more secondary infections, we obtain a super-spreading event rate of 2.3 per 1000 imported SARS-CoV-2 cases, rising up to 13.7 for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7.

474,Comparison of IgG and neutralizing antibody responses after one or two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in previously infected and uninfected persons,"ObjectiveTo compare anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody concentrations and antibody-mediated neutralization of spike-ACE2 receptor binding in vitro following vaccination of non-hospitalized participants by sero-status and acute virus diagnosis history.

MethodsParticipants were studied before and after mRNA vaccination in a community-based, home-collected, longitudinal serosurvey; none reported hospitalization for COVID-19. Prior to vaccination, some reported prior positive acute viral diagnostic testing and were seropositive (COVID-19+). Participants who did not report acute viral diagnostic testing were categorized as seropositive or seronegative based on anti-spike RBD IgG test results. Primary measures were anti-spike RBD IgG concentration and percent antibody-mediated neutralization of spike protein-ACE2 interaction prior to vaccination, and after one or two doses of vaccine.

ResultsOf 290 unique vaccine recipients, 42 reported a prior COVID-19 diagnosis and were seropositive (COVID-19+). Of the 248 with no history of acute viral diagnostic testing, 105 were seropositive and 143 seronegative before vaccination. The median age was 38yrs (range 21-83) with 65% female and 35% male; 40% were non-white. Responses were evaluated after one (n=140) or two (n=170) doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine. After one dose, median post-vaccine IgG concentration and percent neutralization were each significantly higher among the COVID-19+ group (median 47.7 {micro}g/ml, IgG; >99.9% neutralization) compared to the seropositives (3.4 {micro}g /ml IgG; 62.8% neutralization) and seronegatives (2.2 {micro}g /ml IgG; 39.5% neutralization). The latter two groups reached >95% neutralization after the second vaccine dose.

ConclusionsA prior outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with strong anti-spike RBD IgG and in vitro neutralizing responses after one vaccine dose. Persons seropositive for anti-spike RBD IgG in the absence of acute viral diagnostic testing, and those who were seronegative, required two doses to achieve equivalently high levels of IgG and neutralization activity. One mRNA vaccine dose is not sufficient to generate in vitro evidence of strong protection against COVID-19 among most persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, nor among seronegative persons.",Alexis R.

We consider 10 compartments in the human population in order to take into accounts the effects of different specific mitigation policies: susceptible, infected, infectious, quarantined, hospitalized, treated, recovered, non-infectious dead, infectious dead, buried. The population of viruses is also partitioned into 10 compartments corresponding respectively to each of the first nine human population compartments and the free viruses available in the environment. Indeed, we have human to human virus transmission, human to environment virus transmission, environment to human virus transmission and self infection by susceptible individuals. We show the global stability of the disease free equilibrium if a given threshold[T] 0 is less or equal to 1 and we provide how to compute the basic reproduction number[R] 0. A convergence index[T] 1 is also defined in order to estimate the speed at which the disease extincts and an upper bound to the time of extinction is given. The existence of the endemic equilibrium is conditional and its description is provided. We evaluate the sensitivity of[R] 0,[T] 0 and[T] 1 to control parameters such as the maximal human density allowed per unit of surface, the rate of disinfection both for people and environment, the mobility probability, the wearing mask probability or efficiency, and the human to human contact rate which results from the previous one. Except the maximal human density allowed per unit of surface, all those parameters have significant effects on the qualitative dynamics of the disease. The most significant is the probability of wearing mask followed by the probability of mobility and the disinfection rate. According to a functional cost taking into consideration economic impacts of SARS-CoV-2, we determine and discuss optimal fighting strategies. The study is applied to real available data from Cameroon and an estimation of model parameters is done. After several simulations, social distancing and the disinfection frequency appear as the main elements of the optimal control strategy.",David Jaures FOTSA MBOGNE; Stephane Yanick TCHOUMI; Yannick Kouakep Tchaptchie; Vivient Corneille KAMLA; Jean Claude KAMGANG; Duplex Elvis HOUPA DANGA; Samuel BOWONG TSAKOU; David BEKOLLE,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252880,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252880,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
476,Bromhexine Hydrochloride Prophylaxis of COVID-19 for Medical Personnel: A Randomized Open-Label Study,"BackgroundBromhexine hydrochloride has been suggested as a TMPRSS2 protease blocker that precludes the penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 into cells. We aimed to assess the preventive potential of regular bromhexine hydrochloride intake for COVID-19 risk reduction in medical staff actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsIn a single-center randomized open-label study medical staff managing patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and followed-up for 8 weeks. The study began at the initiation of COVID-19 management in the clinic. We enrolled 50 participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: 25 were assigned to bromhexine hydrochloride treatment (8 mg 3 times per day), and 25 were controls. The composite primary endpoint was a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to SARS-CoV-2 or the signs of clinical infection within 28 days and at week 8. Secondary endpoints included the symptomatic infection rate and positive nasopharyngeal swab (PCR) tests.

ResultsThe rate of the combined primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the active treatment group (2/25 [8%]) and control group (7/25 [28%]); P = 0.07. A fewer number of participants developed symptomatic infection (confirmed COVID-19) in the treatment group compared to controls (0/25 vs 5/25; P = 0.02).

ConclusionBromhexine hydrochloride prophylaxis was associated with a reduced rate of symptomatic COVID-19. However, the prophylactic treatment was not associated with a lower combined primary endpoint rate, a positive swab PCR test and/or COVID-19.

477,Development and Implementation of a scalable and versatile test for COVID-19 diagnostics in rural communities,"Rapid and widespread testing of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for an effective public health response aimed at containing and mitigating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Successful health policy implementation relies on early identification of infected individuals and extensive contact tracing.However, rural communities, where resources for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive challenges to achieving this success. Accordingly, we report the development of an academic, public land grant University laboratory-based detection assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical specimens that can be readily deployed in areas where access to testing is limited. The test, which is a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples provided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our test exhibits comparable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity values compared to other molecular assays. Additionally, this test can be re-configured to meet supply chain shortages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable to several clinical specimens. Test development also involved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a stable collection media that allowed samples to be transported for hours over a dispersed rural region without the need for a cold-chain. These two elements that were critical when shortages impacted testing and when personnel needed to reach areas that were geographically isolated from the testing center. Overall, using a robust, easy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs and help local health departments assess and manage outbreaks. This additional testing capacity is particularly germane for smaller cities and rural regions that would otherwise be unable to meet the testing demand.",Alessandro Ceci; Carmen Munoz-Ballester; Allison Tegge; Katherine L Brown; Robyn Anne Umans; F.

478,Predictive Capacity of COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate,"COVID-19 infections can spread silently, due to the simultaneous presence of significant numbers of both critical and asymptomatic to mild cases. While for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision makers planning ahead (e.g. medical structures and equipment). Previous work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e. the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospital and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA). The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e. the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead, of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.",Livio Fenga; Mauro Gaspari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252897,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252897,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True

480,A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies comparing mental health before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundIncreases in mental health problems have been observed in some studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether changes have been large and experienced by most population sub-groups, persisted over time or been symptom specific.

MethodsWe systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined changes in mental health among the same group of participants before and during the pandemic (PROSPERO: CRD42021231256). Searches for published and unpublished studies were conducted in January 2021. Changes in mental health (standardised mean change; SMC) were examined using meta-analyses.

FindingsSixty-five studies were included. There was an overall increase in mental health symptoms that was most pronounced during March-April 2020 (SMC = .102 [95% CI: .026 to .192], p = 0.03) before significantly declining over time (May-July SMC = .067 [95% CI: -.022 to .157], p = .141). Compared to measures of anxiety (SMC = 0.13, p = 0.02) and general mental health (SMC = -.03, p = 0.65), increases in depression and mood disorder symptoms tended to be larger (SMC = 0.22, p < .001) and reductions over time appeared less pronounced. Increased mental health symptoms were observed across most population subgroups examined but there was no evidence of any change in symptoms among samples with a pre-existing mental health condition.

InterpretationThere was a small increase in mental health symptoms soon after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that decreased and was comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020 among most population sub-groups and symptom types.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere have been reported increases in mental health problems during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether changes in mental health problems have been symptom specific, how changes have differed across populations and whether increased mental health problems have persisted over time. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined mental health among the same participants prior to and during the pandemic in 2020. This approach allowed us to quantify the mental health burden associated with the outbreak of the pandemic and how it has changed over time. We searched Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and PsychInfo from January 2020 to January 11, 2021 and identified eligible unpublished articles available on pre-print servers.

Added value of this studyWe identified 65 eligible articles that reported 201 comparisons of mental health pre vs. post pandemic outbreak. Meta-analysis indicated that longitudinal cohort studies that examined mental health prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 showed a significant but statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. The overall increase in mental health symptoms was most pronounced during the early stages of the pandemic (March-April), before decreasing and being generally comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020.

Compared to anxiety and general measures of mental health functioning, increases tended to be larger in depressive symptoms and although statistically small, remained elevated past the early stages of the pandemic. Increases in mental health symptoms were observed across most population sub-groups, but there was no evidence of a change in mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health condition.

Implications of all the available evidenceFindings confirm that the initial outbreak of the pandemic was associated with a significant but statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. Given that small effects may have meaningful cumulative consequences at the population level, there is a need for continued mental health provision and monitoring particularly during periods of the pandemic when infection rates and deaths are high. Further into the pandemic, mental health problems decreased significantly, which indicated recovery and resilience in overall mental health. Contrary to predictions made early in the pandemic, there was also no evidence of a worsening of mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health condition. Overall the results of the present analyses suggest that the pandemic may not have caused an unprecedented and long lasting mental health crisis, instead there appears to have been resilience in mental health.",Eric Robinson; Angelina R Sutin; Michael Daly; Andrew Jones,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252921,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252921,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
481,An increase in willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the US between October 2020 and February 2021: longitudinal evidence from the Understanding America Study,"BackgroundRecent evidence suggests that willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 has been declining throughout the pandemic and is low among ethnic minority groups.

MethodsObservational study using a nationally representative longitudinal sample (N =7,840) from the Understanding America Study (UAS). Changes in the percentage of respondents willing to vaccinate, undecided, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine were examined over 20 survey waves from April 1 2020 to February 15 2021.

ResultsAfter a sharp decline in willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 between April and October 2020 (from 74.0% to 52.7%), willingness to vaccinate increased by 8.1% (p <.001) to 60.8% between October 2020 and February 2021. A significant increase in willingness to vaccinate was observed across all demographic groups examined and Black (15.6% increase) and Hispanic participants (12.1% increase) showed particularly large changes.

ConclusionsWillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 increased in the US from October 2020 to February 2021.

482,Analysis of the Factors Affecting the Adoption and Compliance of the NHS COVID-19 Mobile Application,"ObjectivesTo conduct an independent study investigating how adults perceive the usability, and functionality of the ""NHS COVID-19"" app. This study aims to highlight strengths, and provide recommendations to improve adoption of future contact tracing developments.

Design, Setting, and Participants1036 adults in England and Wales completed a 60-item, web-based observational survey. This survey was disseminated through social media outlets and email-lists.

Primary Outcome MeasuresTo evaluate the compliance and public attitude towards the ""NHS COVID-19"" app, regarding its functionality and main features. This included whether participants expectations were met, and their thoughts on the privacy and security of app data. Furthermore, to distinguish how usability, perception, and adoption differed with varying demographics and user values.

ResultsFair rates of app compliance were identified across participants, with the app meeting the expectation of 59.7% of participants who downloaded it. However, participants finding the interface challenging were less likely to read information in the app and had a lesser understanding of its functionality. Furthermore, lack of understanding regarding the apps functionality and privacy preserving features were behind the reasons why users did not download it. A readability analysis of the text revealed that the information of the app was conveyed at a level which might only be accessible to under 60% of the population. The study highlighted issues related to the high probability of false positives caused by the design choices in the ""Check-In"" feature.

ConclusionThis study showed that while the ""NHS COVID-19"" app was viewed positively, however, there remained issues regarding participants perceived knowledge of the app with privacy and functionality, which appeared to affect compliance. Therefore, we have recommended improvements regarding the delivery and presentation of the apps information, and highlighted the potential need for the ability to check out of venues to reduce the number of false positive contacts.

485,A common TMPRSS2 variant protects against severe COVID-19,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has a wide range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Old age is the strongest factor associated with increased COVID19-related mortality, followed by sex and pre-existing conditions. The importance of genetic and immunological factors on COVID19 outcome is also starting to emerge, as demonstrated by population studies and the discovery of damaging variants in genes controlling type I IFN immunity and of autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs. The human protein transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it is required to activate the virus spike protein, facilitating entry into target cells. We focused on the only common TMPRSS2 non-synonymous variant predicted to be damaging (rs12329760), which has a minor allele frequency of [~]25% in the population. In a large population of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, we show that this variant is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing severe COVID19 (OR 0.87, 95%CI:0.79-0.97, p=0.01). This association was stronger in homozygous individuals when compared to the general population (OR 0.65, 95%CI:0.50-0.84, p=1.3x10-3). We demonstrate in vitro that this variant, which causes the amino acid substitution valine to methionine, impacts the catalytic activity of TMPRSS2 and is less able to support SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated entry into cells.

TMPRSS2 rs12329760 is a common variant associated with a significantly decreased risk of severe COVID19. Further studies are needed to assess the expression of the TMPRSS2 across different age groups. Moreover, our results identify TMPRSS2 as a promising drug target, with a potential role for camostat mesilate, a drug approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis, in the treatment of COVID19. Clinical trials are needed to confirm this.","Alessia David; Nicholas Parkinson; Thomas P Peacock; Erola Pairo-Castineira; Tarun Khanna; Aurelie Cobat; Albert Tenesa; Vanessa Sancho-Shimizu; - GenOMICC Investigators, ISARIC4C Investigators; Jean-Laurent Casanova; Laurent Abel; Wendy S Barclay; J Kenneth Baillie; Michael J.E.

486,Impact of remdesivir on 28 day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: February 2021 Meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a myriad of potential therapeutic agents, including antivirals such as remdesivir. The first RCT reporting results on the impact of remdesivir on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the ACTT-1 trial published in November, 2020. The ACTT-1 trial showed more rapid clinical improvement and a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received remdesivir.

This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of remdesivir therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the analysis process.

MethodsMeta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing remdesivir to usual care or placebo. The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered and published in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021229985) on February 5, 2021.

ResultsFour English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7,333 hospitalized patients worldwide using remdesivir in COVID-19 positive patients.

Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who received remdesivir therapy compared to usual care or placebo. The random effects meta-analysis has a summary odd ratio is 0.89 (95% CI 0.65-1.21, p = 0.30). Considerable variability in the severity of illness is noted with the rates of IMV at the time of randomization ranging from 0% to 27%.

ConclusionsThis meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by February 1, 2021 did not show reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received remdesivir.

487,Comparison of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies in the United States,"A critical question in the COVID-19 pandemic is how to optimally allocate the first available vaccinations to maximize health impact. We used a static simulation model with detailed demographic and risk factor stratification to compare the impact of different vaccine prioritization strategies in the United States on key health outcomes, using California as a case example. We calibrated the model to demographic and location data on 28,175 COVID-19 deaths in California up to December 30, 2020, and incorporated variation in risk by occupation and comorbidity status using published estimates. We predicted the proportion of COVID-19 clinical cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted over 6 months relative to a scenario of no vaccination for five vaccination strategies that prioritized vaccination by a single risk factor: random allocation; targeting special populations (e.g. incarcerated individuals); targeting older individuals; targeting essential workers; and targeting individuals with comorbidities. Targeting older individuals averted the highest proportion of DALYs (40% for 5 million individuals vaccinated) and deaths (65%) but the lowest proportion of cases (12%). Targeting essential workers averted the lowest proportion of DALYs (25%) and deaths (33%). Allocating vaccinations simultaneously by age and location or by age, sex, race/ethnicity, location, occupation, and comorbidity status averted a significantly higher proportion of DALYs (48% and 56%) than any strategy prioritizing by a single risk factor. Our results corroborate findings of other studies that age targeting is the best single-risk-factor prioritization strategy for averting DALYs, and suggest that targeting by multiple risk factors would provide additional benefit.

Significance statementCOVID-19 has caused a global pandemic, and a key public health question is who should get the first available vaccinations. Most vaccine prioritization analyses have only considered variation in risk of infection and death by age and occupation. We provide a more granular analysis with stratification by demographics, risk factors, and location. We predict the impact of different prioritization strategies on COVID-19 cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We find that age-based targeting averts the most deaths and DALYs of strategies targeting by a single risk factor, but that targeting by two or more risk factors simultaneously would avert significantly more deaths and DALYs. Our findings highlight the potential value of multiple-risk-factor targeting of vaccination when supply is limited.",Lloyd A. C. Chapman; Poojan Shukla; Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer; Priya B.

488,Factors associated with increased mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a Mexican public hospital: the other faces of health system oversaturation.,"BACKGROUNDThe lethality rate of COVID-19 in Mexico is one of the highest worldwide, but in-hospital factors associated with this increased rate have yet to be explored. This study aims to evaluate those factors that could be associated with mortality at 28-days in critically ill COVID-19 patients in Mexico.

METHODSThis is a retrospective analysis of the patients included in the clinical trial (NCT04381858) which recruited patients with severe COVID-19 with high oxygen requirement or mechanical ventilation from May to October 2020. The primary outcome, death at 28, was analyzed.

RESULTSBetween May and October 2020, 196 predominantly male patients (n=122, 62.2%) with an average of 58.1 years ({+/-} 15.5), were included in the cohort. Mortality at 28 days was 44.3 % (n= 84). Patients included in the second trimester had a greater mortality rate when compared with those recruited in the first trimester (54.1 vs 32.1, p< 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the detected protective factors were the use of fentanyl HR 0.51 (95%CI 0.31 - 0.85, p=0.01), the use of antibiotics HR 0.22 (95% CI 0.13 - 0.36, p<0.01), and a previously healthy state (no comorbidities other than obesity) HR 0.58 (95%CI 0.35 - 0.94, p =0.03); risk factors were severe kidney injury (AKIN3) HR 1.74 (95%CI 1.04 - 2.9, p=0.035), elevated D-Dimer levels HR 1.02 (95%CI 1.007 - 1.04, p=0.005), shock OR 5.8 (2.4 - 13.8, p<0.01), and recruitment in the second trimester OR 2.3 ((1.1 - 4.8, p=0.02).

CONCLUSIONSIn-hospital mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients has increased in our center. The appropriate use of antibiotics, the type of sedation, and AKIN3 are modifiable factors directly related to this increased mortality. The increase in mortality observed in the second trimester is explained by hospital overcrowding that began in August 2020.",Mariana Jocelyn Macias Guzman; Alejandro Castillo Gonzalez; Jose Lenin Beltran Gonzalez; Mario Gonzalez Gamez; Emmanuel Antonio Mendoza Enciso; Itzel Ovalle Robles; Andrea Lucia Garcia Diaz; Cesar Mauricio Gutierrez Pena; Lucila Martinez Medina; Victor Antonio Monroy Colin; Jose Manuel Arreola Guerra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252084,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252084,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
489,Serological reconstruction of COVID-19 epidemics through analysis of antibody kinetics to SARS-CoV-2 proteins,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a complex antibody response that varies by orders of magnitude between individuals and over time. Waning antibody levels lead to reduced sensitivity of serological diagnostic tests over time. This undermines the utility of serological surveillance as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses into its second year. Here we develop a multiplex serological test for measuring antibodies of three isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA) to five SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), Spike subunit 2, Membrane-Envelope fusion) and the Spike proteins of four seasonal coronaviruses. We measure antibody responses in several cohorts of French and Irish hospitalized patients and healthcare workers followed for up to eleven months after symptom onset. The data are analysed with a mathematical model of antibody kinetics to quantify the duration of antibody responses accounting for inter-individual variation. One year after symptoms, we estimate that 36% (95% range: 11%, 94%) of anti-S IgG remains, 31% (9%, 89%) anti-RBD IgG remains, and 7% (1%, 31%) anti-N IgG remains. Antibodies of the IgM isotype waned more rapidly, with 9% (2%, 32%) anti-RBD IgM remaining after one year. Antibodies of the IgA isotype also waned rapidly, with 10% (3%, 38%) anti-RBD IgA remaining after one year. Quantitative measurements of antibody responses were used to train machine learning algorithms for classification of previous infection and estimation of time since infection. The resulting diagnostic test classified previous infections with 99% specificity and 98% (95% confidence interval: 94%, 99%) sensitivity, with no evidence for declining sensitivity over the time scale considered. The diagnostic test also provided accurate classification of time since infection into intervals of 0 - 3 months, 3 - 6 months, and 6 - 12 months. Finally, we present a computational method for serological reconstruction of past SARS-CoV-2 transmission using the data from this test when applied to samples from a single cross-sectional sero-prevalence survey.",Stephane Pelleau; Tom Woudenberg; Jason Rosado; Francoise Donnadieu; Laura Garcia; Thomas Obadia; Soazic Gardais; Yasmine Elgharbawy; Aurelie Velay; Maria Gonzalez; Jacques-Yves Nizou; Nizar Khelil; Konstantinos Zannis; Charlotte Cockram; Sarah Merkling; Annalisa Meola; Solen Kerneis; Benjamin Terrier; Jerome de Seze; Delphine Planas; Olivier Schwartz; Francois Dejardin; Stephane Petres; Cassandre von Platen; Laurence Arowas; Louise Perrin de Facci; Darragh Duffy; Cliona Ni Cheallaigh; Niall Conlon; Liam Townsend; Heidi Auerswald; Marija Backovic; Bruno Hoen; Arnaud Fontanet; Ivo Mueller; Samira Fafi-Kremer; Timothee Bruel; Michael T White,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252532,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252532,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
490,Comparative analysis of policies and programs to support families and children during COVID-19,"BackgroundPolicies and programs that promote positive social environments for young children and their families have the potential to improve early childhood development and long-term health. However, due to the community-wide public health measures implemented to reduce transmission of COVID-19, many families are experiencing health and socio-economic challenges and pre-existing supports and services may no longer be available. In this study, we compared the policies and programs countries have implemented to support maternal and child health during the first wave of COVID-19.

MethodsWe compared the policies and programs implemented to support child health and well-being during the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. A grey literature review was performed to identify policies, announcements, and guidelines released from governmental and public health organizations within each country related to children, parents, families, early childhood development, adverse childhood experiences, child welfare, pre-school, or daycares. We also performed a manual search of government websites. Both provincial and federal government policies were included for Canada.

ResultsThe main policies identified were focused on prenatal care, well-baby visit and immunization schedules, financial supports, domestic violence and housing, childcare supports, child protective services, and food security. All of the included countries implemented some of these policies, but there was a large variation in the number, size, and barriers to access these supports. None of the countries implemented supports in all of the potential areas identified.

ConclusionPolitical legacy and previous redistributive policies might have influenced the variation in policies and programs introduced by governments. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, further opportunity for governments to implement supportive programs and policies for children and families exists.",Joanne Kearon; Mark Cachia; Sarah Carsley; Meta van den Heuvel; Jessica Hopkins,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252943,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
491,Diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of clinical symptoms for the diagnosis of mild COVID 19,"ObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinical symptoms and their predictive values in patients with suspected mild COVID-19 and to identify target groups for self-isolation and outpatient treatment without additional testing in the primary health care system.

MethodsWe conducted an open-label prospective study in both male and female patients aged 18 to 72 years with suspected mild COVID-19 who were sequentially enrolled in the study. The clinical diagnosis was performed in accordance with the WHO recommendations based on the acute onset of such symptoms as olfactory dysfunction, hyperthermia, myalgia, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, cough, rhinolalia, sore throat, without pneumonia or hypoxia in persons in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. The physician assessed clinical symptoms using a 4-point scale. The patient self-assessed clinical symptoms using a ten-point visual analogue scale (VAS). All enrolled patients underwent laboratory testing to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19.

ResultsOf the 120 patients underwent testing, the diagnosis of mild COVID-19 was confirmed in 96 patients and ruled out in 24 patients. When assessing symptoms by a physician according to the correlation analysis, hyperthermia, myalgia, nasal congestion and rhinolalia have a positive predictive value with a significance level of more than 0.6. When self-assessing symptoms by a patient, fever, myalgia and nasal congestion have a diagnostic accuracy with a significance level of more than 0.5. Nasal discharge, cough and sore throat have negative predictive values.

DiscussionThe presence of these symptoms in patients with an acute onset of the disease can help to make a clinical diagnosis of coronavirus disease and identify target groups for self-isolation and outpatient treatment without additional testing. Highly suspect asymptomatic patients are not considered as those who have possible mild COVID-19 infection.

492,Endotracheal application of ultraviolet A light in critically ill severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 patients: A first-in-human study,"BackgroundPromising preclinical experiments show that, under specific and monitored conditions, ultraviolet-A (UVA) exposure reduces certain bacteria, fungi, and viruses including coronavirus-229E without harming mammalian columnar epithelial cells. We aimed to evaluate the safety and effects of UVA therapy administered by a novel device via endotracheal tube in critically ill subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsFive newly intubated mechanically ventilated adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an endotracheal tube size 7.5mm or greater, were treated with UVA for 20 minutes daily for 5 days, and followed for 30 days.

ResultsFive subjects were enrolled (mean age 56.6yrs, 3 male). At baseline, all subjects scored 9/10 on the WHO clinical severity scale (10=death) with predicted mortality ranging from 21 to 95%. Average log changes in endotracheal viral load from baseline to day 5 and day 6 were -2.41 (range -1.16 to -4.54; Friedman P=0.002) and -3.20 (range -1.20 to -6.77; Friedman P<0.001), respectively. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events. One subject died 17 days after enrollment due to intracranial hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulation while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining subjects clinically improved and scored 2, 4, 5, and 7 on the WHO scale at day 30. In these subjects, the slope of viral load reduction during UVA treatment correlated with the slope of improvement in clinical WHO severity score over time (Spearman rho=1, P<0.001).

ConclusionIn this first-in-human study, endotracheal UVA therapy under specific and monitored settings, was safe with a significant reduction in respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral burden over the treatment period.

493,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 induces fibrin(ogen) resistant to fibrinolysis: Implications for microclot formation in COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by unprecedented clinical pathologies. One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to {beta} and {gamma} fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. This observation may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients.",Lize M Grobbelaar; Chantelle Venter; Mare Vlok; Malebogo Ngoepe; Gert J Laubscher; Petrus J Lourens; Janami Steenkamp; Douglas B Kell; Etheresia Pretorius; Douglas B Kell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252960,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252960,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True

495,"Covid-19 in the California State Prison System: An Observational Study of Decarceration, Ongoing Risks, and Risk Factors","BackgroundCorrectional institutions nationwide are seeking to mitigate Covid-19-related risks.

ObjectiveTo quantify changes to Californias prison population since the pandemic began and identify risk factors for Covid-19 infection.

DesignWe described residents demographic characteristics, health status, Covid-19 risk scores, room occupancy, and labor participation. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between rates of Covid-19 infection and room occupancy and out-of-room labor, respectively.

SettingCalifornia state prisons (March 1-October 10, 2020).

ParticipantsResidents of California state prisons.

MeasurementsChanges in the incarcerated populations size, composition, housing, and activities. For the risk factor analysis, the exposure variables were room type (cells vs dormitories) and labor participation (any room occupant participating in the prior 2 weeks) and the outcome variable was incident Covid-19 case rates.

ResultsThe incarcerated population decreased 19.1% (119,401 to 96,623) during the study period.On October 10, 2020, 11.5% of residents were aged [&ge;]60, 18.3% had high Covid-19 risk scores, 31.0% participated in out-of-room labor, and 14.8% lived in rooms with [&ge;]10 occupants. Nearly 40% of residents with high Covid-19 risk scores lived in dormitories. In 9 prisons with major outbreaks (6,928 rooms; 21,750 residents), dormitory residents had higher infection rates than cell residents (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51 95%CI, 2.25-2.80) and residents of rooms with labor participation had higher rates than residents of other rooms (AHR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.39-1.74).

LimitationsInability to measure density of residents living conditions or contact networks among residents and staff.

ConclusionDespite reductions in room occupancy and mixing, California prisons still house many medically vulnerable residents in risky settings. Reducing risks further requires a combination of strategies, including rehousing, decarceration, and vaccination.

We conducted direct ex vivo assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescents up to 254 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Here, we report that memory T cell responses were maintained during the study period. In particular, we observed sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells detected by activation-induced markers, the proportion of stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells increased, peaking at approximately 120 DPSO. Development of TSCM cells was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer staining. Considering the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of TSCM cells, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are long-lasting after recovery from COVID-19.

499,"High seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a vulnerable population in Perpignan, France","BackgroundIn March 2020, many cases of COVID-19 were reported in three socially deprived neighbourhoods of the city of Perpignan, in the south of France, where large sedentary gypsy communities live. A study to measure seroprevalence was conducted in July 2020 to assess the level of contamination in these neighbourhoods after the first wave of the pandemic, and to identify factors associated with seropositivity.

MethodsSCoPe is a cross-sectional survey conducted in selected persons aged six years old and over living in three neighbourhoods in Perpignan. Households were selected by systematic sampling and participants by random sampling. Collected blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies using the EIecsys(R) immunoassay to target the coronaviruss spike protein. Antibody seroprevalence was estimated from weighted data and associated factors were investigated using multivariate logistic regression.

ResultsThe seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 35.4% (95% CI: 30.2-41.0). Over a fifth of seropositive individuals (21.7% ([14.1-31.8]) did not report any COVID-19 symptom. People aged 15-64 years old were at greater risk of seropositivity than those aged 65 years or over. Obesity prevalence was 40.7% (35.8-45.8) and obese people were more likely to be seropositive (aOR=2.0 [1.1-3.8]). The risk of being seropositive was higher in households with clinical COVID-19 cases (One case: aOR=2.5 [1.3-5.0]). In the neighbourhood with the highest measured seroprevalence, people living in a dwelling with 1-2 rooms had a higher risk of being seropositive than those living in a 4-room house (aOR=2.8 [1.2-6.3]). Working during the lockdown was associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (aOR=0.2 [0.03-1.0]).

500,"Serological surveys to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults (Sero-MAss study), Massachusetts, July-August 2020","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis. The state of Massachusetts was especially impacted during the initial stages; however, the extent of asymptomatic transmission remains poorly understood due to limited asymptomatic testing in the ""first wave."" To address this gap, a geographically representative and contact-free seroprevalence survey was conducted in July-August 2020, to estimate prior undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections.

MethodsStudents, faculty, librarians and staff members at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were invited to participate in this study along with one member of their household in June 2020. Two separate sampling frames were generated from administrative lists: all undergraduates and their household members (primary sampling group) were randomly selected with probability proportional to population size. All staff, faculty, graduate students and librarians (secondary sampling group) were selected as a simple random sample. After informed consent and a socio-behavioral survey, participants were mailed test kits and asked to return self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, and then IgM antibodies if IgG-positive. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for survey non-response. Binomial models were used to assess factors associated with seropositivity in both sample groups separately.

ResultsApproximately 27,000 persons were invited via email to assess eligibility. Of the 1,001 individuals invited to participate in the study, 762 (76%) returned blood samples for analysis. In the primary sampling group 548 returned samples, of which 230 enrolled a household member. Within the secondary sampling group of 214 individuals, 79 enrolled a household member. In the primary sample group, 36 (4.6%) had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated weighed prevalence for this population of 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5 to 8.0). In the secondary sampling group, 10 (3.4%) of 292 individuals had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated adjusted prevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.4). No samples were IgM positive. No association was found in either sample group between seropositivity and self-reported work duties or customer-facing hours. In the primary sampling group, self-reported febrile illness since Feb 2020, male sex, and minority race (Black or American Indian/Alaskan Native) were associated with seropositivity. No factors except geographic regions within the state were associated with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the secondary sampling group.

InterpretationThis study provides insight into the seroprevalence of university-related populations and their household members across the state of Massachusetts during the summer of 2020 of the pandemic and helps to fill a critical gap in estimating the levels of sub-clinical and asymptomatic infection. Estimates like these can be used to calibrate models that estimate levels of population immunity over time to inform public health interventions and policy.

501,Higher COVID-19 vaccination rates are linked to decreased county-level COVID-19 incidence across USA,"Real world evidence studies of mass vaccination across health systems have reaffirmed the safety1 and efficacy2,3 of the FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. However, the impact of vaccination on community transmission remains to be characterized. Here, we compare the cumulative county-level vaccination rates with the corresponding COVID-19 incidence rates among 87 million individuals from 580 counties in the United States, including 12 million individuals who have received at least one vaccine dose. We find that cumulative county-level vaccination rate through March 1, 2021 is significantly associated with a concomitant decline in COVID-19 incidence (Spearman correlation {rho} = -0.22, p-value = 8.3e-8), with stronger negative correlations in the Midwestern counties ({rho} = -0.37, p-value = 1.3e-7) and Southern counties ({rho} = -0.33, p-value = 4.5e-5) studied. Additionally, all examined US regions demonstrate significant negative correlations between cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate prior to the vaccine rollout and the decline in the COVID-19 incidence rate between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, with the US western region being particularly striking ({rho} = -0.66, p-value = 5.3e-37). However, the cumulative vaccination rate and cumulative incidence rate are noted to be statistically independent variables, emphasizing the need to continue the ongoing vaccination roll out at scale. Given confounders such as different coronavirus restrictions and mask mandates, varying population densities, and distinct levels of diagnostic testing and vaccine availabilities across US counties, we are advancing a public health resource to amplify transparency in vaccine efficacy monitoring (https://public.nferx.com/covid-monitor-lab/vaccinationcheck). Application of this resource highlights outliers like Dimmit county (Texas), where infection rates have increased significantly despite higher vaccination rates, ostensibly owing to amplified travel as a ""vaccination hub""; as well as Henry county (Ohio) which encountered shipping delays leading to postponement of the vaccine clinics.

502,Decisive Conditions for Strategic Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2,"While vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2 are being approved, the number of available doses is limited as it may take months until the production of vaccines can meet the actual demand. The majority of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines elicits strong immune responses when administered as prime-boost regimens. Since the immunological response to the first (""prime"") injection may provide already a substantial reduction in infectiousness and protection against severe disease, it may be more effective--under certain conditions--to vaccinate as many people as possible with only one shot, instead of administering a person a second (""boost"") shot. Such a strategic vaccination campaign may help to more effectively slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce hospitalizations, and reduce fatalities. Yet, the conditions which make single-dose vaccination favorable over prime-boost administrations are not well understood. Here, we formulate a model that helps explore these decisive conditions as a function of the various time scales and epidemiological mechanisms at work. We study how these conditions arise from disease prevalence, vaccination rates, basic reproduction number, prime and prime-boost efficacies, prime-boost intervals, and waning rates. By combining epidemiological modeling, random sampling techniques, and decision tree learning, we find that prime-first vaccination is robustly favored over prime-boost vaccination campaigns, even for high vaccination rates, high disease prevalence, and a relatively low single-dose efficacy.",Lucas Böttcher; Jan Nagler,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252962,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252962,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
503,Adjusting COVID-19 seroprevalence survey results to account for test sensitivity and specificity,"Population-based seroprevalence surveys can provide useful estimates of the number of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still susceptible as well as contribute to better estimates of the case fatality rate and other measures of COVID-19 severity. No serological test is 100% accurate, however, and the standard correction that epidemiologists use to adjust estimates relies on estimates of the test sensitivity and specificity often based on small validation studies. This paper develops a fully Bayesian approach to adjust observed prevalence estimates for sensitivity and specificity. Application to a seroprevalence survey conducted in New York State in 2020 demonstrates that this approach results in more realistic - and narrower - credible interval than the standard sensitivity analysis using confidence interval endpoints. In addition, the model permits incorporating data on the geographical distribution of reported case counts to create informative priors on the cumulative incidence to produce estimates and credible intervals for smaller geographic areas than often can be precisely estimated with seroprevalence surveys.",Mark J Meyer; Shuting Yan; Samantha Schlageter; John D.

504,High-frequency screening combined with diagnostic testing for control of SARS-CoV-2 in high-density settings: an economic evaluation of resources allocation for public health benefit,"SARS-CoV-2 spreads quickly in dense populations, with serious implications for universities, workplaces, and other settings where exposure reduction practices are difficult to implement. Rapid screening has been proposed as a tool to slow the spread of the virus; however, many commonly used diagnostic tests (e.g., RT-qPCR) are expensive, difficult to deploy (e.g., require a nasopharyngeal specimen), and have extended turn-around times. We evaluated testing regimes that combined diagnostic testing using qPCR with high-frequency screening using a novel reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP, herein LAMP) assay. We used a compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to simulate screening of a university population. We also developed a Shiny application to allow administrators and public health professionals to develop optimal testing strategies given site-specific assumptions about testing investment, target population, and cost. The frequency of screening, especially when pooling samples, was more important for minimizing epidemic size than test sensitivity, behavioral compliance, contact tracing capacity, and time between testing and results. Our results suggest that when testing budgets are limited, it is safer and more cost-effective to allocate the majority of funds to screening. Rapid, cost-effective, and scalable screening tests, like LAMP, should be viewed as critical components of SARS-CoV-2 testing in high-density populations.",Will Rogers; Manuel Ruiz-Aravena; Dale Hansen; Wyatt Madden Sonoma; Maureen Kessler; Matthew W Fields; Matthew J Ferrari; Connie B Chang; Jayne Morrow; Andrew Hoegh; Raina K Plowright,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252949,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252949,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
505,Non-uniform UV-C dose across N95 facepieces can cause 2.9-log variation in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation,"During public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, ultraviolet-C (UV-C) decontamination of N95 respirators for emergency reuse has been implemented to mitigate shortages. However, decontamination efficacy across N95s is poorly understood, due to the dependence on received UV-C dose, which varies across the complex three-dimensional N95 shape. Robust quantification of UV-C dose across N95 facepieces presents challenges, as few UV-C measurement tools have sufficient 1) small, flexible form factor, and 2) angular response. To address this gap, we combine optical modeling and quantitative photochromic indicator (PCI) dosimetry with viral inactivation assays to generate high-resolution maps of ""on-N95"" UV-C dose and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 viral inactivation across N95 facepieces within a commercial decontamination chamber. Using modeling to rapidly identify on-N95 locations of interest, in-situ measurements report a 17.4 {+/-} 5.0-fold dose difference across N95 facepieces, yielding 2.9 {+/-} 0.2-log variation in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. UV-C dose at several on-N95 locations was lower than the lowest-dose locations on the chamber floor, highlighting the importance of on-N95 dose validation. Overall, we couple optical simulation with in-situ PCI dosimetry to relate UV-C dose and viral inactivation at specific",Alisha Geldert; Alison Su; Allison W.

506,A Rapid Method to Evaluate Pre-Travel Testing Programs for COVID-19: A Study in Hawaii,"BackgroundPre-travel testing programs are being implemented around the world to curb COVID-19 and its variants from incoming travelers. A common approach is a single pre-travel test, 72 hours before departure, such as in Hawaii; however this raises concerns for those who are incubating or those infected after pre-travel testing or during transit. We need a rapid method to assess the effectiveness of pre-travel testing programs, and we use Hawaii as our case study.

MethodsWe invited travelers departing from Kahului main airport at the end of their visit to Maui (major tourist destination among the Hawaiian islands) and performed COVID-19 PCR testing. Eligible participants needed a negative pre-travel test and a Hawaiian stay [&le;] 14 days. We designed for anonymous testing at the end of travel so that travel plans would be unaffected, and we aimed for [&ge;] 70% study participation.

ResultsAmong consecutive eligible travelers, 282 consented and 111 declined to participate, leading to a 72% (67-76%, 95% confidence interval) participation rate. Among 281 tested participants, two were positive with COVID-19, with an estimated positivity rate of 7 cases per 1,000 travelers. The top states of residence are California (58%) and Washington (21%). The mean length of stay was 7.7 {+/-} 0.2 days. Regarding pre-travel testing, 87% had non-nasopharyngeal tests and 66% had self-administered tests.

ConclusionsThis positivity rate leads to an estimated 17-30 infected travelers arriving daily to Maui in November-December 2020, and an estimated 52-70 infected travelers arriving daily to Hawaii during the same period. These counts surpass the Maui District Health Offices projected ability to accommodate 10 infected visitors daily in Maui; therefore, an additional mitigation layer for travelers is recommended. This rapid field study can be replicated widely in airports to assess effectiveness of pre-travel programs and can be expanded to evaluate COVID-19 importation and its variants.",Amy T.

507,Meta-Analysis of the Dynamics of the Emergence of Mutations and Variants of SARS-CoV-2,"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and is the causative agent for the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a 29,811 nucleotides positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus. Due to inefficient proofreading ability of the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex, coronaviruses are known to acquire new mutations following replication, which constitutes one of the main factors driving the evolution of its genome and the emergence of new genetic variants. In the last few months, the identification of new B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) variants of concern (VOC) highlighted the importance of tracking the emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their impact on transmissibility, infectivity, and neutralizing antibody escape capabilities. These VOC demonstrate increased transmissibility and antibody escape, and reduce current vaccine efficacy. Here we analyzed the appearance and prevalence trajectory of mutations that appeared in all SARS-CoV-2 genes from December 2019 to January 2021. Our goals were to identify which modifications are the most frequent, study the dynamics of their spread, their incorporation into the consensus sequence, and their impact on virus biology. We also analyzed the structural properties of the spike glycoprotein of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants. This study offers an integrative view of the emergence, disappearance, and consensus sequence integration of successful mutations that constitute new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their impact on neutralizing antibody therapeutics and vaccines.

IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19, which has caused > 2 million deaths worldwide as of January, 2021. Mutations occur in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 during viral replication and affect viral infectivity, transmissibility and virulence. In early March 2020, the D614G mutation in the spike protein emerged, which increased the viral transmissibility and is now found in >90% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in GISAID database. Between October and December 2020, B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) variants of concern (VOCs) emerged, which have increased neutralizing antibody escape capabilities because of mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Characterizing mutations in these variants is crucial because of their effect on adaptive immune response, neutralizing antibody therapy, and their impact on vaccine efficacy. Here we tracked and analyzed mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genes over a twelve-month period and investigated functional alterations in the spike of VOCs.",Nicolas Castonguay; Wandong Zhang; Marc-André Langlois,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21252994,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21252994,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
508,Secondary attack rates of COVID-19 in Norwegian families: A nation-wide register-based study,"BackgroundReported transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 within families vary widely, and there are few reports on transmission from children to other family members. More knowledge is needed to guide infection control measures.

ObjectiveTo characterize the family index case for detected SARS-CoV-2 and describe testing and secondary attack rates in the family.

DesignRegister-based cohort study.

SettingIndividual-level administrative data of all families and all PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway in 2020.

ParticipantsAll families with at least one parent and one child below the age of 20, who lived at the same address (N=662 582), where at least one member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.

Main outcome measuresSecondary attack rates (SAR7) were defined as the share of non-index family members with a positive PCR test within seven days of the index case. SARs were calculated separately for parent- and child-index cases, and for parent- and child-secondary cases.

ResultsWe identified 7548 index cases, comprising 26 991 individuals, of which 12184 were parents and 14808 children. The index was a parent in 66% of the cases. Among the children, 42% of the index cases were in the age group 17-20 and only 8% 0-6 years. When the index was a parent, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 24 to 25), whilst SAR7 was 14% (95%CI 13 to 15) when the index was a child. However, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 20 to 28) when the index was a child aged 0-6 years and declined steeply with increasing age of the index child. SAR7 from index parent to other parents was 35% (95%CI 33 to 36), and from index child to other children 12% (95%CI 11 to 13). SAR7 from index child aged 0-6 to parents was 27% (95%CI 22 to 33). The percent of non-index family members tested within 7 days after the index case, increased from about 20% in April to 80% in December, however, SAR7 stabilized at about 20% from May.

ConclusionParents and older children are most often index cases for SARS-CoV-2 in families in Norway, while parents and young children more often transmit the virus within the families. This study suggests that whilst the absolute infection numbers are low for young children because of their low introduction rate, when infected, young children and parents transmit the virus to the same extent within the family.

509,"COVID 19 Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of the Healthcare Providers in United Arab Emirates","BackgroundHealth care providers at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, inadequate knowledge and practice about COVID-19, and infection control may lead to increased risk of disease transmission. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of COVID 19 cases is important in preventing transmission and improving patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, altitude, and practice of healthcare providers in the United Arab Emirates toward COVID-19 and to examine its determinants.

MethodA cross-sectional study was conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of Healthcare providers regarding COVID-19. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from of April 11 to July 23, using an online anonymous self-administered questionnaire.

ResultsA total of 2371 healthcare providers responded to the survey. A total of 1091 worked in inpatient hospitals, 494 in primary health care, and 388 in emergency and ICU care. The overall performance score for all healthcare providers was as follows: 49.1%, poor score; 41.8 %, intermediate score; and 9.2%, good score with a mean result of 17.14. Factors leading to better overall performance scores were years of experience, pediatricians specialty, and specialists occupation. A total of 55.7% received good direct knowledge from all healthcare providers. In practice, 48% had good practices toward COVID-19. The overall attitude mean was 2.8, from a maximum score of 7, indicating a positive attitude toward COVID-19.

ConclusionsThe study-demonstrated gaps in specific aspects of knowledge and practice that should be focused on in future education and HCP awareness. A structured training program targeting all HCPs is needed to have good clinical knowledge and practice about COVID-19.",Aljazia Khalfan Alghfeli; Amal Abdul Rahim Al Zarouni; Hamda Musabbah Alremeithi; Roqayah Abdulla Almadhaani; Latifa Baynouna Alketbi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252719,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252719,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
