0,Genetic screening for TLR7 variants in young and previously healthy men with severe COVID-19: a case series,"Advanced age, male sex and chronic comorbidities are associated with severe COVID-19. However, these general risk factors cannot explain why critical illness occurs in young and apparently healthy individuals. In the past months, several publications have identified susceptibility loci and genes using comprehensive GWAS studies or genome, exome or candidate genes analysis. A recent study reported rare, loss-of-function TLR7 variants in otherwise healthy young brother pairs from two families with severe COVID-19. We aimed to prospectively study the prevalence of rare X-chromosomal TLR7 genetic variants in our cohort of young male patients with severe COVID-19. We recruited 13 patients [&le;]50 years who had no risk factors known to be associated with severe disease. We studied the entire TLR7 coding region and identified two missense variants (p.Asn215Ser, c.644A>G and p.Trp933Arg, c.2797T>C) in two out of 13 cases (15.4%). These variants were not previously reported in population control databases (gnomAD) and were predicted to be damaging by all in silico predictors. The male index patients were between 25 and 30 years old and had no apparent comorbidities. The TLR7 p.Asn215Ser co-segregated in 2 first-degree relatives severely affected by COVID-19, in a younger previously healthy the variant was found in hemizygous state , and in an older than 60 was in heterozygous state. No family members were available for testing the segregation of the p.Trp933Arg variant. These results further support that susceptibility to severe COVID-19 could be determined by inherited rare genetic variants in TLR7. Understanding the causes and mechanisms of life-threatening COVID-19 is crucial and could lead to novel preventive and therapeutic options. This study supports a rationale for the genetic screening for TLR7 variants in young men with severe COVID-19 in the absence of other relevant risk factors. A diagnosis of TLR7 deficiency could not only inform on treatment options for the patient, but it also enables for pre-symptomatic testing of at-risk male relatives with the possibility of instituting early preventive and therapeutic interventions.",Xavier Solanich; Gardenia Vargas-Parra; Caspar I. van der Made; Annet Simons; Janneke Schuurs-Hoeijmakers; Arnau Antoli; Jesus del Valle; Gemma Rocamora-Blanch; Fernando Setien; Manel Esteller; Antoni Riera-Mestre; Joan Sabater-Riera; Gabriel Capella; Frank L. van de Veerdonk; Ben van der Hoven; Xavier Corbella; Alexander Hoischen; Conxi Lazaro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21252289,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21252289,2021-03-25,2021-03-25,,True
1,System-wide hematopoietic and immune signaling aberrations in COVID-19 revealed by deep proteome and phosphoproteome analysis,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become a global crisis. To gain systems-level insights into its pathogenesis, we compared the blood proteome and phosphoproteome of ICU patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and healthy control subjects by quantitative mass spectrometry. We find that COVID-19 is marked with hyperactive T cell and B cell signaling, compromised innate immune response, and dysregulated inflammation, coagulation, metabolism, RNA splicing, transcription and translation pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes global reprogramming of the kinome and kinase-substrate network, resulting in defective antiviral defense via the CK2-OPN-IL-12/IFN-I axis, lymphocyte cell death via aberrant JAK/STAT signaling, and inactivation of innate immune cells via inhibitory SIRPA, SIGLEC and SLAM family receptor signaling. Our work identifies CK2, SYK, JAK3, TYK2 and IL-12 as potential targets for immunomodulatory treatment of severe COVID-19 and provides a valuable approach and resource for deciphering the mechanism of pathogen-host interactions.",Tomonori Kaneko; Sally Esmail; Courtney Voss; Claudio M Martin; Marat Slessarev; Owen Hovey; Xuguang Liu; Mingliang Ye; Sung Kim; Douglas Fraser; Shawn SC Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253675,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253675,2021-03-25,2021-03-25,,True
2,"Changes in live births, preterm birth, low birth weight, and cesarean deliveries in the United States during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and associated social, economic, and clinical disruption have been widely speculated to affect pregnancy decision-making and outcomes. While a few US-based studies have examined subnational changes in fertility, preterm birth, and stillbirth, there remains limited knowledge of how the pandemic impacted childbearing and a broader set of perinatal health indicators at the national-level throughout 2020. Here, we use recently released national-level data to fill this gap. Importantly, we, unlike earlier work, use time-series methods to account for strong temporal patterning (e.g., seasonality, trend) that could otherwise lead to spurious findings. Methods: For the years 2015 to 2020, we obtained national monthly counts of births and rates (per 100 births) for six perinatal indicators: preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), early preterm birth (<34 weeks gestation), late preterm birth (34-36 weeks gestation), low birth weight birth (<2500 g), very low birth weight birth (<1500 g), and cesarean delivery. We use an interrupted time-series approach to compare the outcomes observed after the pandemic began (March 2020) to those expected had the pandemic not occurred. Results: For total births as well as five of the six indicators (i.e., all but the rate of cesarean delivery), observed values fall well below expected levels (p<.0001 for each test) during the entire pandemic period. Declines in preterm birth and low birth weight were largest in magnitude in both early and later stages of the 2020 pandemic, while those for live births occurred at the end of the year. Discussion: Our findings provide some of the first national evidence of substantial reductions in live births and adverse perinatal outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Only cesarean delivery appeared unaffected. These declines were not uniform across the pandemic, suggesting that several mechanisms, which require further study, may explain these patterns.",Alison Gemmill; Joan A.

3,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 tracks early interstate transmission of P.1 lineage and diversification within P.2 clade in Brazil,"The sharp increase of COVID-19 cases in late 2020 has made Brazil the new epicenter of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages P.1 and P.2, first identified respectively in Manaus and Rio de Janeiro, have been associated with potentially higher transmission rates and antibody neutralization escape. In this study, we performed a whole-genome sequencing of 185 samples isolated from three out of the five Brazilian regions, including Amazonas (North region), Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba and Bahia (Northeast region), and Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) aiming to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations that could be involved in the surge of COVID19 cases in Brazil. Here, we showed a widespread dispersion of P.1 and P.2 across Brazilian regions. Except for Manaus, P.2 was the predominant lineage identified country-wise. P.2 lineage was estimated to have originated in February, 2020 and has diverged into new clades. Interstate transmission of P.2 was detected since March, but reached its peak in December, 2020 and January, 2021. Transmission of P.1 was also high in December. P.1 origin was inferred to have happened in August 2020. We also confirmed the presence of the variant under investigation (VUI) NP13L recently described in the southernmost region of Brazil to have spread across the Northeastern states. P.1, P.2 and NP13L are descended from the ancient B.1.1.28 strain, although during the first phase of the pandemic in Brazil presence of B.1.1.33 strain was also reported. Here, for the first time, we investigate the possible occurrence of a new variant of concern descending from B.1.1.33 that also carries the E484K mutation. Indeed, the recurrent report of many novel SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Brazil could be due to the absence of effective control measures resulting in high SARS-CoV2 transmission rates. Altogether, our findings provided a landscape of the critical state of SARS-CoV-2 across Brazil and confirm the need to sustain continuous sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide in order to early identify novel variants of concern and to monitor for vaccine effectiveness.",Alessandra P Lamarca; Luiz G P de Almeida; Ronaldo da Silva Francisco Jr.; Lucymara Fassarella Agnez Lima; Katia Castanho Scortecci; Vinicius Pietta Perez; Otavio J.

4,A public vaccine-induced human antibody protects against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants,"The emergence of antigenically distinct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with increased transmissibility is a public health threat. Some of these variants show substantial resistance to neutralization by SARS-CoV-2 infection- or vaccination-induced antibodies, which principally target the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the virus spike glycoprotein. Here, we describe 2C08, a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced germinal center B cell-derived human monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor binding motif within the RBD. 2C08 broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants with remarkable potency and reduces lung inflammation, viral load, and morbidity in hamsters challenged with either an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain or a recent variant of concern. Clonal analysis identified 2C08-like public clonotypes among B cell clones responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in at least 20 out of 78 individuals. Thus, 2C08-like antibodies can be readily induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and mitigate resistance by circulating variants of concern.",Aaron J. Schmitz; Jackson S. Turner; Zhuoming Liu; Ishmael D.

5,Building alternative consensus trees and supertrees using k-means and Robinson and Foulds distance,"Each gene has its own evolutionary history which can substantially differ from the evolutionary histories of other genes. For example, some individual genes or oper-ons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer and recombination events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be represented by its own phy-logenetic tree which may display different evolutionary patterns from the species tree that accounts for the main patterns of vertical descent. The output of tradi-tional consensus tree or supertree inference methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. Here, we describe a new efficient method for inferring multiple alterna-tive consensus trees and supertrees to best represent the most important evolution-ary patterns of a given set of phylogenetic trees (i.e. additive trees or X-trees). We show how a specific version of the popular k-means clustering algorithm, based on some interesting properties of the Robinson and Foulds topological distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (when the data are homogeneous) or multiple (when the data are heterogeneous) cluster(s) of trees. We adapt the popular Cali[n]ski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Ball and Hall, and Gap cluster validity in-dices to tree clustering with k-means. A special attention is paid to the relevant but very challenging problem of inferring alternative supertrees, built from phylogenies constructed for different, but mutually overlapping, sets of taxa. The use of the Euclidean approximation in the objective function of the method makes it faster than the existing tree clustering techniques, and thus perfectly suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets. In this study, we apply it to discover alternative supertrees characterizing the main patterns of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the related betacoronaviruses.",Nadia Tahiri; Bernard Fichet; Vladimir Makarenkov,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436812,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436812,2021-03-25,2021-03-25,,False
6,A Sanger-based approach for scaling up screening of SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern,"The global spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern underscore an urgent need of simple deployed molecular tools that can differentiate these lineages. Several tools and protocols have been shared since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they need to be timely adapted to cope with SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the virus genetic material have been widely used, it still presents practical difficulties such as high cost, shortage of available reagents in the global market, need of a specialized laboratorial infrastructure and well-trained staff. These limitations result in genomic surveillance blackouts across several countries. Here we propose a rapid and accessible protocol based on Sanger sequencing of a single PCR fragment that is able to identify and discriminate all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) identified so far, according to each characteristic mutational profile at the Spike-RBD region (K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, A570D). Twelve COVID-19 samples from Brazilian patients were evaluated for both WGS and Sanger sequencing: three from P.2, two from P.1 and seven from B.1.1 lineage. All results from the Sanger sequencing method perfectly matched the mutational profile of VOCs and non-VOCs described by WGS. In summary, this approach allows a much broader network of laboratories to perform molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and report results within a shorter time frame, which is of utmost importance in the context of rapid public health decisions in a fast evolving worldwide pandemic.",Matheus Filgueira Bezerra; Lais Ceschini Machado; Viviane Carvalho; Cassia Docena; Sinval Brandao-Filho; Constancia Flavia Junqueira Ayres; Marcelo Henrique Santos Paiva; Gabriel Luz Wallau,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21253956,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21253956,2021-03-25,2021-03-25,,True
7,Demographic and clinical features associated with in-hospital mortality in Egyptian COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cohort study,"Introduction: Since the worldwide emergence of the COVID-19, several protocols were used by different healthcare organisations. We evaluated in this study the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 disease in Egyptian population with special consideration for its mortality predictors. Methodology: 8162 participants (mean age 48.7 years,54.5% males) with RT-PCR positive COVID-19 were included. The electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. Results: The in-hospital mortality was 11.2%. There was a statistically significant strong association of in-hospital mortality with age >60 years old (OR:4.7; 95% CI 4.1-5.4;p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR:4.6; 95% CI 3.99-5.32;p<0.001), hypertension (OR:3.9; 95% CI 3.4-4.5;p<0.001), coronary artery disease (OR:2.7; 95% CI 2.2-3.2;p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR:2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.5;p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR:4.8; 95% CI 3.9-5.9;p<0.001), malignancy (OR:3.7; 95% CI 2.3-5.75;p<0.001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio >3.1 (OR:6.4; 95% CI 4.4-9.5;P< 0.001), and ground glass opacities (GGOs) in CT chest (OR:3.5; 95% CI 2.84-4.4;P<0.001), respectively. There was a statistically significant moderate association of in-hospital mortality with male gender (OR:1.6; 95% CI 1.38-1.83;p<0.001) and smoking (OR:1.6; 95% CI 1.3-1.9;p<0.001).

8,Efficacy of a Broadly Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 Ferritin Nanoparticle Vaccine in Nonhuman Primates,"The emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants stresses the continued need for next-generation vaccines that confer broad protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We developed and evaluated an adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine in nonhuman primates. High-dose (50 mcg) SpFN vaccine, given twice within a 28 day interval, induced a Th1-biased CD4 T cell helper response and a peak neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer of 52,773 against wild-type virus, with activity against SARS-CoV-1 and minimal decrement against variants of concern. Vaccinated animals mounted an anamnestic response on high-dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge that translated into rapid elimination of replicating virus in their upper and lower airways and lung parenchyma. The potent and broad immunogenicity profile of this vaccine and its resulting efficacy in NHPs supports its utility as a candidate platform for SARS-like betacoronaviruses.",Michael G.

9,Computational prediction of the effect of amino acid changes on the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor,"The association of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike with human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) represents the first required step for viral entry. Amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased infectivity and potential for immune evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes in the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 receptor can help assess the public health implications and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born electrostatic solvation, hydrogen-bonding, {pi}-{pi} packing and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves an accuracy of 82.2% in terms of correctly classifying single amino-acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient r of 0.69 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a 5-fold cross validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for effectively screening binding affinity change with unknown single and multiple amino-acid changes. This can be a very valuable tool to predict host adaptation and zoonotic spillover of current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Chen Chen; Veda Sheeresh Boorla; Deepro Banerjee; Ratul Chowdhury; Victoria S Cavener; Ruth  H Nissly; Abhinay Gontu; Nina R Boyle; Kurt Vandegrift; Meera Surendran Nair; Suresh V Kuchipudi; Costas D Maranas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436885,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436885,2021-03-25,2021-03-25,,False
10,The Role of Testing Availability on Intentions to Isolate during the COVID-19 Pandemic - A Randomized Trial,"Background: Little information exists on how COVID-19 testing availability influences intentions to engage in risky behavior. Understanding the behavioral effects of testing availability may provide insight into the role of adequate testing on controlling viral transmission. Objective: To evaluate the impact of testing availability on behavioral intention to self-isolate in a simulated scenario with participants who have been clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 1400 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) through a national, online, opt-in survey. Participants were randomized to one of three hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario asked participants to imagine having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 along with a clinical diagnosis from their physician. However, scenarios differed in their testing result: testing unavailable, positive test, or negative test. The primary outcome was intention to engage in high-risk COVID-19 behaviors, measured using an 11-item mean score (range 1-7) that was pre-registered prior to data collection. The randomized survey was conducted between July 23rd to July 29th, 2020. Results: Out of 1194 respondents (41.6% male, 58.4% female) with a median age of 38.5 years, participants who had no testing available in their clinical scenario showed significantly greater intentions to engage in behavior facilitating COVID-19 transmission compared to those who received a positive confirmatory test result scenario (difference (SE): 0.14 (0.06), P=0.016), equating to an 11.1% increase in mean score risky behavior intentions. Intention to engage in behaviors that can spread COVID-19 were also positively associated with male gender, poor health status, and Republican party affiliation. Conclusion: Testing availability appears to play an independent role in influencing behaviors facilitating COVID-19 transmission.

11,A robust SARS-CoV-2 replication model in primary human epithelial cells at the air liquid interface to assess antiviral agents,"There are, besides Remdesivir (RDV), no approved antivirals for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To aid in the search for antivirals against this virus, we explored the use of human tracheal airway epithelial cells (HAEC) and human small airway epithelial cells (HsAEC) grown at the air/liquid interface (ALI) and infected at the apical side with either one of two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The virus was shown to replicate to high titers for extended periods of time (at least 8 days) and, in particular an isolate with the D614G in the spike (S) protein did so more efficiently at 35{degrees}C than at 37{degrees}C. The effect of a selected panel of reference drugs that were added to the culture medium at the basolateral side of the system was explored. GS-441524 (the parent nucleoside of Remdesivir), EIDD-1931 (the active metabolite of Molnupiravir) and IFN ({beta}1 and {lambda}1) all resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of viral RNA and infectious virus titers at the apical side. However, AT-511 (a guanosine nucleotide previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2) failed to inhibit viral replication.

12,Genomic surveillance and phylodynamic analyses reveal emergence of novel mutation and co-mutation patterns within SARS-CoV2 variants prevalent in India,"Emergence of distinct viral clades has been observed in SARS-CoV2 variants across the world and India. Identification of the genomic diversity and the phylodynamic profiles of the prevalent strains of the country are critical to understand the evolution and spread of the variants. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 54 SARS-CoV2 strains collected from COVID-19 patients in Kolkata, West Bengal during August to October 2020. Phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses were performed using these 54 and other sequences from India and abroad available in GISAID database. Spatio-temporal evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen across various regions and states of India over three different time periods in the year 2020 were analyzed. We estimated the clade dynamics of the Indian strains and compared the clade specific mutations and the co-mutation patterns across states and union territories of India over the time course. We observed that GR, GH and G (GISAID) or 20B and 20A (Nextstrain) clades were the prevalent clades in India during middle and later half of the year 2020. However, frequent mutations and co-mutations observed within the major clades across time periods do not show much overlap, indicating emergence of newer mutations in the viral population prevailing in the country.

13,Freely accessible ready to use global infrastructure for SARS-CoV-2 monitoring,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the first global health crisis to occur in the age of big genomic data. Although data generation capacity is well established and sufficiently standardized, analytical capacity is not. To establish analytical capacity it is necessary to pull together global computational resources and deliver the best open source tools and analysis workflows within a ready to use, universally accessible resource. Such a resource should not be controlled by a single research group, institution, or country. Instead it should be maintained by a community of users and developers who ensure that the system remains operational and populated with current tools. A community is also essential for facilitating the types of discourse needed to establish best analytical practices. Bringing together public computational research infrastructure from the USA, Europe, and Australia, we developed a distributed data analysis platform that accomplishes these goals. It is immediately accessible to anyone in the world and is designed for the analysis of rapidly growing collections of deep sequencing datasets.

14,Sulforaphane exhibits in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has incited a global health crisis. Currently, there are no orally available medications for prophylaxis for those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and limited therapeutic options for those who develop COVID-19. We evaluated the antiviral activity of sulforaphane (SFN), a naturally occurring, orally available, well-tolerated, nutritional supplement present in high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables with limited side effects. SFN inhibited in vitro replication of four strains of SARS-CoV-2 as well as that of the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Further, SFN and remdesivir interacted synergistically to inhibit coronavirus infection in vitro. Prophylactic administration of SFN to K18-hACE2 mice prior to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased the viral load in the lungs and upper respiratory tract and reduced lung injury and pulmonary pathology compared to untreated infected mice. SFN treatment diminished immune cell activation in the lungs, including significantly lower recruitment of myeloid cells and a reduction in T cell activation and cytokine production.

15,Computational assessment of the spike protein antigenicity reveals diversity in B cell epitopes but stability in T cell epitopes across SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Since its emergence into the human population at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Efforts to develop a protective vaccine against COVID-19 have yielded several vaccine platforms currently in distribution targeting the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence from the first cases of infection. In recent months, variants of SARS-CoV-2 have raised concerns that viral mutation may undermine vaccination efforts through viral escape of host immune memory acquired from infection or vaccination. We therefore used a computational approach to predict changes in spike protein antigenicity with respect to host B cell and CD8+ T cell immunity across six SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, and mink-related). Our epitope analysis using DiscoTope suggests possible changes in B cell epitopes in the S1 region of the spike protein across variants, in particular the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages, which may influence immunodominance. Additionally, we show that high-affinity MHC-I-binding peptides and glycosylation sites on the spike protein appear consistent between variants with the exception of an extra glycosylation site in the P.1 variant. Together, these analyses suggests T cell vaccine strategies have the most longevity before reformulation.",Anni Ge; Melissa Rioux; Alyson Ann Kelvin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.437035,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.437035,2021-03-25,2021-03-25,,False
16,Target Capture Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes Using the ONETest Coronaviruses Plus,"Background Genomic sequencing is important to track and monitor genetic changes in SARS-CoV-2. We introduce a target capture next-generation sequencing methodology, the ONETest Coronaviruses Plus, to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes and select genes of other respiratory viruses simultaneously. Methods We applied the ONETest on 70 respiratory samples (collected in Florida, USA between May and July, 2020), in which SARS-CoV-2 had been detected by a qualitative PCR assay. For 48 (69%) of the samples, we also applied the ARTIC protocol for Illumina sequencing. All the libraries were sequenced as 2x150 nucleotide reads on an Illumina instrument. The ONETest data were analyzed using an in-house pipeline and the ARTIC data using a published pipeline to produce consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, to which lineages were assigned using pangolin. Results Of the 70 ONETest libraries, 45 (64%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence (> 29,000 bases and with > 90% of its bases covered by at least 10 reads). Of the 48 ARTIC libraries, 25 (52%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. In 24 out of 34 (71%) samples in which both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences were complete or near-complete and in which lineage could be assigned to both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage identified was the same. Conclusions The ONETest can be used to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in archived samples and thereby enable detection of circulating and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Target capture approaches, such as the ONETest, are less prone to loss of sequence coverage probably due to amplicon dropouts encountered in amplicon approaches, such as ARTIC. With its added value of characterizing other major respiratory pathogens, although not assessed in this study, the ONETest can help to better understand the epidemiology of infectious respiratory disease in the post COVID-19 era.",Shing Hei Zhan; Sepideh M Alamouti; Brian S Kwok; Meng-Hsun Lee; Jaswinder Khattra; Habib Daneshpajouh; Herbert J Houck; Kenneth H Rand,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.437083,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.437083,2021-03-25,2021-03-25,,False
17,Population homogeneity for the antibody response to COVID-19 Comirnaty vaccine is only reached after the second dose,"While mRNA vaccines authorised for emergency use are administrated worldwide in an effort to contain the COVID19 crisis, little is known about the heterogeneity of the immune response they induce. Here, we report the first 6 weeks of a longitudinal study that quantifies the humoral immune response to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Pfizer/BioNTech, Comirnaty) in 1245 health care providers, the Lx1000HCW-PZF cohort. We reveal a striking inter-individual variation 3 weeks after the 1st dose administration that only in part related to age and sex. While population homogeneity in robust IgG responses was reached upon 2nd dose administration, IgM and IgA levels remain low and heterogenous. Our findings of isotypic and heterogenous antibody responses to Comirnaty highlight the need for evaluating the efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in preventing infection aside disease, and - contrary to what has been proposed - advocate for the interval between the two doses not to be extended.",Joao F Vania; Marie-Louise Bergman; Ligia A Gonçalves; Nadia Duarte; Patricia C Borges; Christian Diwo; Rute Castro; Paula Matoso; Vanessa Malheiro; Ana Brennand; Lindsay Kosack; Onome Akpogheneta; Joao M Figueira; Ana M Casaca; Conceiçao Cardoso; Paula M Alves; Carlos Penha-Gonçalves; Jocelyne Demengeot,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253680,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253680,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
18,SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing from COVID-19 in Ecuadorian patients: a whole country analysis.,"SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, was first described in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread globally. Ecuador was the second country in South America to confirm cases and Guayaquil was one of the first cities in the world to experience high mortality due to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to describe the lineages circulating throughout the country and to compare the mutations in local variants, to the reference strain. In this work we used the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence the whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 119 patients from all provinces of Ecuador, using the ARTIC network protocols. Our data from lineage assignment of the one hundred and nineteen whole genomes revealed twenty different lineages. All genomes presented differences in the S gene compared to the Wuhan reference strain, being the D614G amino acid replacement the most common change. The B.1.1.119 lineage was the most frequent and was found in several locations in the Coast and Andean region. Three sequences were assigned to the new B.1.1.7 lineage.

19,"Characterising long COVID more than 6 months after acute infection in adults; prospective longitudinal cohort study, England","Background Most individuals with COVID-19 will recover without sequelae, but some will develop long-term multi-system impairments. The definition, duration, prevalence and symptoms associated with long COVID, however, have not been established. Methods Public Health England (PHE) initiated longitudinal surveillance of clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers for monthly assessment and blood sampling for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in March 2020. Eight months after enrolment, participants completed an online questionnaire including 72 symptoms in the preceding month. Symptomatic mild-to-moderate cases with confirmed COVID-19 were compared with asymptomatic, seronegative controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent symptoms associated with long COVID. Findings All 2,147 participants were contacted and 1,671 (77.8%) completed the questionnaire, including 140 (8.4%) cases and 1,160 controls. At a median of 7.5 (IQR 7.1-7.8) months after infection, 20 cases (14.3%) had ongoing (4/140, 2.9%) or episodic (16/140, 11.4%) symptoms. We identified three clusters of symptoms associated with long COVID, those affecting the sensory (ageusia, anosmia, loss of appetite and blurred vision), neurological (forgetfulness, short-term memory loss and confusion/brain fog) and cardiorespiratory (chest tightness/pain, unusual fatigue, breathlessness after minimal exertion/at rest, palpitations) systems. The sensory cluster had the highest association with being a case (aOR 5.25, 95% CI 3.45-8.01). Dermatological, gynaecological, gastrointestinal or mental health symptoms were not significantly different between cases and controls. Interpretation Most persistent symptoms reported following mild COVID-19 were equally common in cases and controls. While all three clusters identified had a strong association with cases, the sensory cluster had the highest specificity and strength of association, and therefore, most likely to be characteristic of long COVID.",Zahin Amin-Chowdhury; Ross J Harris; Felicity Aiano; Maria Zavala; Marta Bertran; Ray Borrow; Ezra Linley; Shazaad Ahmad; Ben Parker; Alex Horsley; Bassam Hallis; Jessica Flood; Kevin E Brown; Gayatri Amirthalingam; Mary E Ramsay; Nick Andrews; Shamez N Ladhani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253633,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253633,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
20,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in 12 Cities of India from July-December 2020,"Objectives: We sought to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban India, which has surprisingly low COVID-19 deaths. Design: Cross-sectional and trend analyses of seroprevalence in self-referred test populations, and of reported cases and COVID mortality data. Participants: 448,518 self-referred individuals using a nationwide chain of private laboratories with central testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and publicly available case and mortality data. Setting: 12 populous cities with nearly 92 million total population. Main outcome measures: Seropositivity trends and predictors (using a Bayesian geospatial model) and prevalence derived from mortality data and infection fatality rates (IFR). Results: For the whole of India, 31% of the self-referred individuals undergoing antibody testing were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seropositivity was higher in females (35%) than in males (30%) overall and in nearly every age group. In these 12 cities, seroprevalence rose from about 18% in July to 41% by December, with steeper increases at ages <20 and 20-44 years than at older ages. The ?M-shaped? age pattern is consistent with intergenerational transmission. Areas of higher childhood measles vaccination in earlier years had lower seropositivity. The patterns of increase in seropositivity and in peak cases and deaths varied substantially across cities. In Delhi, death rates and cases first peaked in June and again in November; Chennai had a single peak in July. Based local IFRs and COVID deaths (adjusted for undercounts), we estimate that 43%-65% of adults above age 20 had been infected (range of mid-estimates of 12%-77%) corresponding 26 to 36 million infected adults in these cities, or an average of 9-12 infected adults per confirmed case. Conclusion: Even with relatively low death rates, the large cities of India had remarkably high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

21,Evaluation of pooling of samples for testing SARS-COV- 2 for mass screening of COVID-19,"Abstract Background The current pandemic of SARS- COV- 2 virus, widely known as COVID-19 has affected millions of people around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended vigorous testing to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory infections to aid in guiding appropriate care and management. Situations like this have demanded robust testing strategies and pooled testing of samples for SARS- COV- 2 virus has provided the solution to mass screening of people. The pooled testing strategy can be very effective in testing with limited resources, yet it comes with its own limitations. These limitations need critical consideration when it comes to testing of highly infectious disease like COVID -19. Methods The study evaluated the pooled testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS- COV- 2 by comparing sensitivity of individual sample testing with 4 and 8 pool sample testing. Median cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. The precision of pooled testing was assessed by doing an inter and intra assay of pooled samples. Coefficient of variance was calculated for inter and intra assay variability. Results The sensitivity becomes considerably low when the samples are pooled, there is a higher percentage of false negatives with higher pool size and when the patient viral load is low or weak positive samples. High variability was seen in the intra and inter assay, especially in weak positive samples and larger pool size. Conclusion As COVID - 19 numbers are still high and testing capacity needs to be high, we have to meticulously evaluate the testing strategy for each country depending on its testing capacity, infrastructure, economic strength, and need to make a serious call on cost effective strategy of resource saving and risk/ cost of missing positive patients.",Dr. Sally Mahmoud; Ms.Esra Ibrahim; Dr. Bhagyashree Thakre; Dr.Juliet George Teddy; Mrs.Preeti Raheja; Dr. Subhashini Ganesan; Dr.Walid Zaher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253567,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253567,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
22,VIRAL AND ANTIBODY TESTING FOR CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19): FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVITY IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS FROM THE UNITED STATES,"Background. Insufficient information on SARS-CoV-2 testing results exists in clinical practice from the United States. Methods. We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study using Optum(R) de-identified COVID-19 electronic health records from the United States to characterize patients who received a SARS-CoV-2 viral or antibody test between February 20, 2020 and July 10, 2020. We assessed temporal trends in testing and positivity by demographic and clinical characteristics; evaluated concordance between viral and antibody tests; and identified factors associated with positivity via multivariable logistic regression. Results. Our study population included 891,754 patients. Overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 9% and 12% for viral and antibody tests, respectively. Positivity rate was inversely associated with the number of individuals tested and decreased over time across regions and race/ethnicities. Among patients who received a viral test followed by an antibody test, concordance ranged from 90%-93% depending on the duration between the two tests which is notable given uncertainties related to specific viral and antibody test characteristics. The following factors increased the odds of viral and antibody positivity in multivariable models: male, Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black and Asian, uninsured or Medicaid insurance, Northeast residence, dementia, diabetes, and obesity. Charlson Comorbidity Index was negatively associated with test positivity. We identified symptoms that were positively associated with test positivity, as well as, commonly co-occurring symptoms / conditions. Pediatric patients had reduced odds of a positive viral test, but conversely had increased odds of a positive antibody test. Conclusions. This study identified sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity within routine clinical practice from the United States.",Lisa Lindsay; Matthew H Secrest; Shemra Rizzo; Daniel Keebler; Fei Yang; Larry W Tsai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253924,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253924,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
23,Occupational risk of COVID-19 by country of birth. A register-based study.,"Aim To assess the role of occupation in the spread of COVID-19 among immigrants in Norway. Methods In 2.729.627 residents in Norway aged 20-70 years and born in Norway, Somalia, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey (mean [SD] age 44 (14) years and 51% men), we examined whether persons employed as taxi drivers, bus- and tram drivers, child care workers, nurses, personal care workers in health, food service counter attendants, waiters/bartenders, cleaners and shop sale persons had a higher risk of COVID-19, from April 1st 2020 to December 2nd 2020, compared to 1) Norwegian-born in the same occupational group and 2) all others with the same birth country and aged 20-70 years, using logistic regressions. Results Within each of the included occupational groups, immigrants had a greatly increased odds of COVID-19 when compared to Norwegian-born (OR ~ 1.66-12.72). However, immigrants working in the selected occupations had the same odds of COVID-19 as person with same birth country not having the same occupation (OR~1). Exceptions were Somalian- , Afghani- and Iraqi personal care workers in health services who had an increased odds of COVID-19 (OR 1.61 (95% CI 1.31, 1.98), OR 1.46 (1.06, 2.02) and OR 1.40 (1.03, 1.91), respectively) compared to others from the same country. Conclusion Immigrants holding various occupations implying close contact with others did not have higher odds of notified infection than others with the same country of birth, except for health care workers.

24,Head-to-head performance comparison of self-collected nasal versus professional-collected nasopharyngeal swab for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test,"Background: In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended two SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antigen detecting rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs), both initially with nasopharyngeal (NP) sample collection. Independent head-to-head studies demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs nasal sampling to be a comparable and reliable alternative for nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling. Methods: We conducted a head-to-head comparison study of a supervised, self-collected nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab and a professional-collected NP swab, using the Panbio Ag-RDT (the second WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT, distributed by Abbott). We calculated positive and negative percent agreement and, compared to the reference standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sensitivity and specificity for both sampling techniques. Results: A SARS-CoV-2 infection could be diagnosed by RT-PCR in 45 of 290 participants (15.5%). Comparing the NMT and NP sampling the positive percent agreement of the Ag-RDT was 88.1% (37/42 PCR positives detected; CI 75.0% - 94.8%). The negative percent agreement was 98.8% (245/248; CI 96.5% - 99.6%). The overall sensitivity of Panbio with NMT sampling was 84.4% (38/45; CI 71.2% - 92.3%) and 88.9% (40/45; CI 76.5% - 95.5%) with NP sampling. Specificity was 99.2% (243/245; CI 97.1% - 99.8%) for both, NP and NMT sampling. The sensitivity of the Panbio test in participants with high viral load (> 7 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/mL) was 96.3% (CI 81.7% - 99.8%) for both, NMT and NP sampling.

25,Increased prevalence of AB group and FY*A red blood cell antigen in Caucasian SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put significant additional pressure on healthcare systems throughout the world. The identification of at-risk population beyond age, pre-existing medical conditions and socioeconomic status has been the subject of only a small part of the global COVID-19 research so far. To this day, the extent to which the red blood cell (RBC) antigens expressed by an individual can be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or clearance remains unknown. Methods: The phenotypes for ABO and RhD and the genotypes for 37 red blood cell (RBC) antigens were determined using high throughput platforms in 90 Caucasian convalescent plasma donors. The antigen frequencies were compared to the expected Caucasian frequencies using Z-tests for two-proportion. Results: The AB phenotype and FY*A genotype frequencies were both independently and significantly increased (1.5x, p=0.018 and 2.2x, p=0.028, respectively) in the convalescent cohort (N=90) compared to reference frequencies. The AB phenotype was also significantly overrepresented (3.2x, p=0.028) within the FY*A sub-group (N=23). The O group was underrepresented within the cohort proportionally to the AB increase, although non-significantly (p=0.110). No other significant RBC antigen expression patterns in the convalescent Caucasian population were identified.

26,Longitudinal determination of mRNA-vaccination induced strongly binding SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a cohort of healthcare workers with and without prior exposure to the novel coronavirus,"Mass vaccination against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a crucial step in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2) vaccine has been shown to induce strong immune responses among the vaccinated population. Measuring SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgG levels is a clinically convenient way to estimate post-vaccination humoral immune responses, but only limited data exists about its short- and long-term dynamics. We present a longitudinal analysis of post-vaccination IgG levels in a cohort of 122 healthcare workers vaccinated with BNT162b2 with weekly follow-up until 35 days past the first dose and results of the first monthly follow-up after that for a subset of these. This prospective, multicenter cohort study consists of two periods for short-term and long-term evaluation of post-vaccination IgG levels. Tests were carried out on 666 samples from 122 participants, using in-house anti-spike 1 and anti-nucleocapsid IgG ELISA assays and a commercial, combined version of these. Participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection mount a quick immune response, reaching peak IgG levels two weeks after vaccination. In contrast, the corresponding IgG levels for previously uninfected participants increase gradually, changing abruptly after the booster dose. Overall higher IgG levels are maintained for the previously infected group 35-70 days after vaccination, and we observe age-dependence of immune response as well. Our results show a robust humoral immune response mounting gradually after the first vaccine dose for the uninfected group, and a much stronger immune response within 7-14 days after the first dose for the previously infected group.",Monika Korodi; Kinga Rakosi; Zsuzsanna Jenei; Gabriella Hudak; Istvan Horvath; Melinda Kakes; Katalin Dallos-Fejer; Eniko Simai; Natalia Staver; Violeta Briciu; Mihaela Lupse; Mirela Flonta; Ariana Almas; Pianoschi Dana; Livia-Maria Terza; Szilard Fejer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253751,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253751,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
27,"Comparative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 serology in healthcare workers with Abbott Architect, Roche Elecsys and The Binding site ELISA immunoassays.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology testing is key for assessing seroprevalence and antibody response post-vaccination in immunocompromised patients. Here we performed a comparison between two high-throughput nucleocapsid assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2) and The Binding Site (TBS) anti-Spike IgG/A/M- SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kit. 236 samples were collected across 2 sites, Portsmouth Hospital University NHS Trust (PHU) and The Dudley Group NHS Trust. We derived concordance, agreement and assay performance as well as using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to redefine the assay threshold of the Abbott assay. Result concordance between the Abbott and TBS was 66%. Discrepant samples were analysed using the Roche assay which showed 100% agreement with the TBS assay. In samples analysed >58 days post-PCR, the sensitivity of Abbott and Roche was 100%. In samples analysed >100 days post-PCR the sensitivity of the Abbott assay dropped to 77.2% but remained at 100% for the Roche assay. A redefined Abbott threshold of 0.64 increased the sensitivity to 90% giving results similar to the Roche and TBS assays. In conclusion, this study demonstrated Abbott assay had a lower sensitivity in comparison to TBS and Roche. This study established TBS can be implemented as a viable alternative for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing where high-throughput assays are not available on site. Furthermore, anti-spike assays, such as TBS, could be used to monitor vaccination responses to deduce SARS-CoV-2 population-immunity.

28,Emergency medicine patient wait time multivariable prediction models: a multicentre derivation and validation study,"Objective Patients, families and community members would like emergency department wait time visibility. This would improve patient journeys through emergency medicine. The study objective was to derive, internally and externally validate machine learning models to predict emergency patient wait times that are applicable to a wide variety of emergency departments. Methods Twelve emergency departments provided three years of retrospective administrative data from Australia (2017-19). Descriptive and exploratory analyses were undertaken on the datasets. Statistical and machine learning models were developed to predict wait times at each site and were internally and externally validated. Model performance was tested on COVID-19 period data (January to June 2020). Results There were 1,930,609 patient episodes analysed and median site wait times varied from 24 to 54 minutes. Individual site model prediction median absolute errors varied from +/-22.6 minutes (95%CI 22.4,22.9) to +/- 44.0 minutes (95%CI 43.4,44.4). Global model prediction median absolute errors varied from +/-33.9 minutes (95%CI 33.4, 34.0) to +/-43.8 minutes (95%CI 43.7, 43.9). Random forest and linear regression models performed the best, rolling average models under-estimated wait times. Important variables were triage category, last-k patient average wait time, and arrival time. Wait time prediction models are not transferable across hospitals.

29,SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and transmission in swimming activities: results from a retrospective cohort study,"There is an urgent need for research on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as the transmissibility differs between settings and populations. Here we report on a questionnaire-based retrospective cohort study of the prevalence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among participants in swimming activities in Denmark in the last five months of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight of 162 swimming activities with a SARS-CoV-2 positive participant led to transmission to 23 other participants. Overall, the percentage of transmission episodes was 4.9% (competitive swimming 8.9%; recreational swimming 1.3%). Overall, the incidence rate of transmission was 19.5 participants per 100.000 pool activity hours (corresponding values: 43.5 and 4.7 for competitive and recreational swimming, respectively). Compliance with precautionary restrictions was highest regarding hand hygiene (98.1%) and lowest in distancing personal sports bags (69.9%). Due to low statistical power, the study showed no significant effect of restrictions. Insight into the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during indoor swimming is needed to estimate the efficiency of restrictive measures on this and other sports and leisure activities. Only when we know how the virus spreads through various settings, optimal strategies to handle the COVID-19 pandemic can be developed.",Martin Brink Termansen; Ask Vest Christiansen; Sebastian Frische,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253351,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253351,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
30,A simple model for how the risk of pandemics from different virus families depends on viral and human traits,"Different virus families, like influenza or corona viruses, exhibit characteristic traits such as typical modes of transmission and replication as well as specific animal reservoirs in which each family of viruses circulate. These traits of genetically related groups of viruses influence how easily an animal virus can adapt to infect humans, how well novel human variants can spread in the population, and the risk of causing a global pandemic. Relating the traits of virus families to their risk of causing future pandemics, and identification of the key time scales within which public health interventions can control the spread of a new virus that could cause a pandemic, are obviously significant. We address these issues using a minimal model whose parameters are related to characteristic traits of different virus families. A key trait of viruses that ""spillover"" from animal reservoirs to infect humans is their ability to propagate infection through the human population (fitness). We find that the risk of pandemics emerging from virus families characterized by a wide distribution of the fitness of spillover strains is much higher than if such strains were characterized by narrow fitness distributions around the same mean. The dependences of the risk of a pandemic on various model parameters exhibit inflection points. We find that these inflection points define informative thresholds. For example, the inflection point in variation of pandemic risk with time after the spillover represents a threshold time beyond which global interventions would likely be too late to prevent a pandemic.",Julia Doelger; Arup K.

31,Recalibrating SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid lateral flow test relative sensitivity from validation studies to absolute sensitivity for detecting individuals with live virus,"Testing for SARS-CoV-2 internationally has focused on COVID-19 diagnosis among symptomatic individuals using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Recently, however, SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid lateral flow tests (LFT) have been rolled out in several countries for testing asymptomatic individuals in public health programmes. Validation studies for LFT have been largely cross-sectional, reporting sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of LFT relative to PCR. However, because PCR detects genetic material left behind for a long period when the individual is no longer infectious, these statistics can under-represent sensitivity of LFT for detecting infectious individuals, especially when sampling asymptomatic populations. LFTs (intended to detect individuals with live virus) validated against PCR (intended to diagnose infection) are not reporting against a gold standard of equivalent measurements. Instead, these validation studies have reported relative performance statistics that need recalibrating to the purpose for which LFT is being used. We present an approach to this recalibration. We derive a formula for recalibrating relative performance statistics from LFT vs PCR validation studies to give likely absolute sensitivity of LFT for detecting individuals with live virus. We show the differences between widely reported apparent sensitivities of LFT and its absolute sensitivity as a test of presence of live virus. After accounting for within-individual viral kinetics and epidemic dynamics within asymptomatic populations we show that a highly performant test of live virus should show a LFT-to-PCR relative sensitivity of less than 50% in conventional validation studies, which after re-calibration would be an absolute sensitivity of more than 80%. Further studies are needed to ascertain the absolute sensitivity of LFT as a test of infectiousness in COVID-19 responses. These studies should include sampling for viral cultures and longitudinal series of LFT and PCR, ideally in cohorts sampled from both contacts of cases and the general population.",Irene Petersen; Alexander Crozier; Iain Buchan; Michael J Mina; Jonathan W Bartlett,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253922,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
32,WiFi mobility models for COVID-19 enable less burdensome and more localized interventions for university campuses,"Infectious diseases, like COVID-19, pose serious challenges to university campuses, and they typically adopt closure as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to control spread early and ensure a gradual return to normalcy. These policies, like remote instruction (SQ), reduce potential contact but also have broad side-effects on campus by hampering local economy, students learning outcomes, and community wellbeing. In this paper, we demonstrate that university policymakers can mitigate these tradeoffs by leveraging anonymized data from their WiFi infrastructure to learn community mobility (WF) and in turn explore more granular policies like localized closures (LC). WF can construct contact networks that capture behavior in a variety of spaces, highlighting new potential transmission pathways and temporal variation in contact behavior. Additionally, WF enables us to design LC policies that close super-spreader locations on campus. On simulating disease spread with contact networks from WF, we find that LC maintains the same reduction in cumulative infections as SQ while showing greater reduction in peak infections and internal transmission. Moreover, LC reduces campus burden by closing fewer locations, forcing fewer students into completely online schedules, and requiring no additional isolation. WF can empower universities to conceive and assess a variety of closure policies to prevent future outbreaks.",Vedant Das Swain; Jiajia Xie; Maanit Madan; Sonia Sargolzaei; James Cai; Munmun De Choudhury; Gregory D.

Since the first SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified from samples collected in December 2019, the virus has been evolving. Now, in the GISAID database of SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of March 17, 2021, 95.7% (758,684 of 792,388) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has the D614G mutation in the spike protein gene; and 22% (178,186 of 792.388) had N501Y mutation which occurred in the more virulent UK variants, South Africa variant and Brazil variant. Large number of minks were infected with the virus which containing the Y453F mutation in Europe, causing zoonosis concerns. To evaluate the genetic characteristics of the US mink-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we analyzed all animal-derived (977), all Canadian (19,529) and US (173,277) SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in GISAID from December 2019 to March 12, 2021, and identified 2 dominant novel variants, the N501T-G142D variant and N501T-G142D-F486L variant, in the US mink-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These variants were not found in minks from Canada or other countries. The Y453F mutation was not identified in the mink-derive sequences in the US and Canada.

34,The Case for Altruism in Institutional Diagnostic Testing,"Amid COVID-19, many institutions deployed vast resources to test their members regularly for safe reopening. This self-focused approach, however, not only overlooks surrounding communities but also remains blind to community transmission that could breach the institution. To test the relative merits of a more altruistic strategy, we built an epidemiological model that assesses the differential impact on case counts when institutions instead allocate a proportion of their tests to members' close contacts in the larger community. We found that testing outside the institution benefits the institution in all plausible circumstances, with the optimal proportion of tests to use externally landing at 45% under baseline model parameters. Our results were robust to local prevalence, secondary attack rate, testing capacity, and contact reporting level, yielding a range of optimal community testing proportions from 18% to 58%. The model performed best under the assumption that community contacts are known to the institution; however, it still demonstrated a significant benefit even without complete knowledge of the contact network.",Ivan Specht; Kian Sani; Yolanda Botti-Lodovico; Michael Hughes; Kristin Heumann; Amy Bronson; John Marshall; Emily Baron; Eric Parrie; Olivia Glennon; Ben Fry; Andres Colubri; Pardis C Sabeti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253669,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253669,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
35,Improved Prediction of COVID-19 Transmission and Mortality Using Google Search Trends for Symptoms in the United States,"Accurate forecasting of emerging infectious diseases can guide public health officials in making appropriate decisions related to the allocation of public health resources. Due to the exponential spread of the COVID-19 infection worldwide, several computational models for forecasting the transmission and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been proposed in the literature. To accelerate scientific and public health insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19, Google released the Google COVID-19 search trends symptoms open-access dataset. Our objective is to develop 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting models of COVID-19 transmission and mortality in the US using the Google search trends for COVID-19 related symptoms. Specifically, we propose a stacked long short-term memory (SLSTM) architecture for predicting COVID-19 confirmed and death cases using historical time series data combined with auxiliary time series data from the Google COVID-19 search trends symptoms dataset. Considering the SLSTM networks trained using historical data only as the base models, our base models for 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting of COVID cases had the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 6.6% and 8.8%, respectively. On the other side, our proposed models had improved MAPE values of 3.2% and 5.6%, respectively. For 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting of COVID-19 deaths, the MAPE values of the base models were 4.8% and 11.4%, while the improved MAPE values of our proposed models were 4.7% and 7.8%, respectively. We found that the Google search trends for ""pneumonia,"" ""shortness of breath,"" and ""fever"" are the most informative search trends for predicting COVID-19 transmission.

36,How safe is Covishield (ChAdOx1nCoV-19) vaccine? Experience from a tertiary care hospital in South India,"Background: COVID vaccine has been recently rolled out for Health care workers in India. Though vaccine trials and data are available, people, including HCWs, need more real-life data from their contexts to get over the vaccine hesitancy. We aimed to determine the incidence of Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) among HCWs after their first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 218 staff of a tertiary care hospital. We circulated a google form with informed consent on the hospital WhatsApp platform and asked them to self-report their vaccination experience. Results: Two thirds (69.7% (152/218),95% CI: 63.1-75.7) had minor AEFI, and none had severe AEFI. Body ache (46.8%, 95% CI:40-53.6) was the most common symptom followed by headache (30.3%, 95% CI: 24.2-36.8) and fever (22%,95% CI: 16.8-28.1). Most of them (39.4%, 95% CI:32.9-46.2) experienced symptoms within 4-24 hours after taking the vaccine while 22.3% (95% CI:17.1-28.6)experienced it after a day. Majority of the HCWs (78.9% 95% CI: 72.8-84.1) were anxious before the vaccination. Younger age group and female gender were significantly associated with AEFI compared to their counterparts.

37,Transcriptome analysis of PBMCs reveals distinct immune response in the asymptomatic and re-detectable positive COVID-19 patients,"The existence of asymptomatic and re-detectable positive COVID-19 patients presents the disease control challenges of COVID-19. Most studies on immune response of COVID-19 have focused on the moderately or severely symptomatic patients, however little is known about the immune response in asymptomatic and re-detectable positive patients. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profiles of PBMCs from 48 COVID-19 patients which include 8 asymptomatic, 13 symptomatic, 15 recovering and 12 RP patients. Our analysis revealed a down-regulation of IFN response and complement activation in the asymptomatic patients compared with the symptomatic, indicating a weaker immune response of the PBMCs in the asymptomatic patients. In addition, we observed a lower expression of the cytokines and chemokines in the PBMC of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. In contrast, the cytokines and chemokines level in the RP patients are higher than the recovering. GSEA analysis showed the enrichment of TNFa/NF-{kappa}B and influenza infection in the RP patients compared with the recovering patients, indicating a flu-like, hyper-inflammatory immune response in the PBMC of RP patients.

38,Weak humoral immune reactivity among residents of long-term care facilities following one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,"Background. Several Canadian provinces are extending the interval between COVID-19 vaccine doses to increase population vaccine coverage more rapidly. However, immunogenicity of these vaccines after one dose is incompletely characterized, particularly among the elderly, who are at greatest risk of severe COVID-19. Methods. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses pre-vaccine and one month following the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, in 12 COVID-19 seronegative residents of long-term care facilities (median age, 82 years), 18 seronegative healthcare workers (HCW; median age, 36 years) and 4 convalescent HCW. Total antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike protein receptor binding domain (S/RBD) were assessed using commercial immunoassays. We quantified IgG and IgM responses to S/RBD and determined the ability of antibodies to block S/RBD binding to ACE2 receptor using ELISA. Neutralizing antibody activity was also assessed using pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. Results. After one vaccine dose, binding antibodies against S/RBD were ~4-fold lower in residents compared to HCW (p<0.001). Inhibition of ACE2 binding was 3-fold lower in residents compared to HCW (p=0.01) and pseudovirus neutralizing activity was 2-fold lower (p=0.003). While six (33%) seronegative HCW neutralized live SARS-CoV-2, only one (8%) resident did (p=0.19). In contrast, convalescent HCW displayed 7- to 20-fold higher levels of binding antibodies and substantial ability to neutralize live virus after one dose. Interpretation. Extending the interval between COVID-19 vaccine doses may pose a risk to the elderly due to lower vaccine immunogenicity in this group.

39,Early super-spreader events are a likely determinant of novel SARS-CoV-2 variant predominance,"The emergence of multiple new SARS-CoV-2 variants, characterized to varying degrees by increased infectivity, higher virulence and evasion of vaccine and infection-induced immunologic memory, has hampered international efforts to contain the virus. While it is generally believed that these variants first develop in single individuals with poor immunologic control of the virus, the factors governing variant predominance in the population remain poorly characterized. Here we present a mathematical framework for variant emergence accounting for the highly variable number of people secondarily infected by individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our simulations suggest that threatening new variants probably develop within infected people fairly commonly, but that most die out and do not achieve permanence in the population. Variants that predominate are more likely to be associated with higher infectiousness, but also the occurrence of a super-spreader event soon after introduction into the population.",Ashish Goyal; Daniel B Reeves; Joshua T Schiffer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254185,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254185,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True

The spike region is a focal point in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with different amino acid changes potentially modulating vaccine response and some being part of variant signatures. NGS is the standard tool to sequence the virus but limitations of different sources hinders expansion of genomic surveillance in many places. To improve surveillance capability we developed a Sanger based sequencing protocol to obtain coverage of most (>95%) spike gene. Eleven nasopharyngeal swabs collections had RNA extracted for real time PCR diagnosis and leftover RNA had up to 3785 bp sequenced at an ABI3500 using dye termination chemistry of nested PCR products of two reactions of one Step RT-PCR.

42,"Relationship between COVID-19 pandemic and ecological, economic, and social characteristics","COVID-19 pandemic had huge impacts on the global world, with both a negative impact on society and economy, but a positive one on nature. But this universal effect resulted in different infection rates from country to country. We analyzed the relationship between the pandemic and ecological, economic, and social characteristics. All of these data were collected in 140 countries at 6 time points. Correlations were studied using univariate and multivariate regression models. The world was interpreted as a single global ecosystem consisting of ecosystem units representing countries. We first studied 140 countries around the world together, and infection rates were related to per capita GDP, Ecological Footprint, median age, urban population, and Biological Capacity, globally. We then ranked 140 countries by infection rate and created 4 equal groups, each with 35 countries. In the first group, the infection rate was very high and was related to the Ecological Footprint (consumption) and GDP per capita (production). This group is dominated by developed countries and their ecological characteristics have proven to be particularly significant. In groups 2, 3, and 4, infection rates were high, moderate, and low, and were primarily associated with median age and urban population. In the scientific discussion, we have interpreted why infection is high in developed countries. Sustainable ecosystems are balanced, unlike the ecosystems of developed countries. According to science, the resilience and health of both natural ecosystems and humans are closely linked to the world of microbial communities.

Provoked by the similarity of these repurposed drugs to those inducing phospholipidosis, a well-known drug side effect, we investigated phospholipidosis as a mechanism for antiviral activity. We tested 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs--including those from phenotypic screens and others that we ourselves had found--for induction of phospholipidosis in cell culture. We found that most of the repurposed drugs, which included hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others that have already progressed to clinical trials, induced phospholipidosis in the same concentration range as their antiviral activity; indeed, there was a strong monotonic correlation between antiviral efficacy and the magnitude of the phospholipidosis. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the gross physical properties of drugs, and does not reflect specific target-based activities, rather it may be considered a confound in early drug discovery. Understanding its role in infection, and detecting its effects rapidly, will allow the community to better distinguish between drugs and lead compounds that more directly impact COVID-19 from the large proportion of molecules that manifest this confounding effect, saving much time, effort and cost.

46,B.1.526 SARS-CoV-2 variants identified in New York City are neutralized by vaccine-elicited and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies,"DNA sequence analysis recently identified the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.526 that is spreading at an alarming rate in the New York City area. Two versions of the variant were identified, both with the prevalent D614G mutation in the spike protein together with four novel point mutations and with an E484K or S477N mutation in the receptor binding domain, raising concerns of possible resistance to vaccine-elicited and therapeutic antibodies. We report that convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies retain full neutralizing titer against the S477N B.1.526 variant and neutralize the E484K version with a modest 3.5-fold decrease in titer as compared to D614G. The E484K version was neutralized with a 12-fold decrease in titer by the REGN10933 monoclonal antibody but the combination cocktail with REGN10987 was fully active. The findings suggest that current vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will remain protective against the B.1.526 variants. The findings further support the value of wide-spread vaccination.",Hao Zhou; Belinda M. Dcosta; Marie I. Samanovic; Mark J. Mulligan; Nathaniel R.

47,Isolation and Characterization of Cross-Neutralizing Coronavirus Antibodies from COVID-19+ Subjects,"SARS-CoV-2 is one of three coronaviruses that have crossed the animal-to-human barrier in the past two decades. The development of a universal human coronavirus vaccine could prevent future pandemics. We characterized 198 antibodies isolated from four COVID19+ subjects and identified 14 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One targeted the NTD, one recognized an epitope in S2 and twelve bound the RBD. Three anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-1 by effectively blocking binding of both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the ACE2 receptor. Using the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the neutralization potency rather than the antibody epitope specificity regulates the in vivo protective potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The anti-S2 antibody also neutralized SARS-CoV-1 and all four cross-neutralizing antibodies neutralized the B.1.351 mutant strain. Thus, our study reveals that epitopes in S2 can serve as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.",Madelein Jennewein; Anna MacCamey; Nicholas Akins; Junli Feng; Leah Homad; Nicholas Hurlburt; Emily Seydoux; Yu-Hsin Wang; Andrew B Stuart; Venkata Vishwanadh Edara; Katharine Floyd; Abigail Vanderheiden; John R.

48,3D visualization of SARS-CoV-2 infection and receptor distribution in Syrian hamster lung lobes display distinct spatial arrangements,"SARS-CoV-2 attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry into cells after which the spike protein is cleaved by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRRS2) to facilitate viral-host membrane fusion. ACE2 and TMPRRS2 expression profiles have been analyzed at the genomic, transcriptomic, and single-cell RNAseq level, however, biologically relevant protein receptor organization in whole tissues is still poorly understood. To describe the organ-level architecture of receptor expression, related to the ability of ACE2 and TMPRRS2 to mediate infectivity, we performed a volumetric analysis of whole Syrian hamster lung lobes. Lung tissue of infected and control animals were stained using antibodies against ACE2 and TMPRRS2, combined with fluorescent spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein staining. This was followed by light-sheet microscopy imaging to visualize expression patterns. The data demonstrates that infection is restricted to sites with both ACE2 and TMPRRS2, the latter is expressed in the primary and secondary bronchi whereas ACE2 is predominantly observed in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Conversely, infection completely overlaps at these sites where ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-localize.

49,Untangling the cell immune response dynamic for severe and critical cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic leading high death tolls worldwide day by day. Clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients can be classified as non-severe, severe and critical cases. In particular, studies have highlighted the relationship between the lymphopenia and the severity of the illness, where CD8+ T cells have the lowest levels in critical cases. In this work, we aim to elucidate the key parameters that define the course of the disease deviating from severe to critical case. To this end, several mathematical models are proposed to represent the dynamic of the immune response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The best model had a good fit to reported experimental data, and in accordance with values found in the literature. Our results suggest that a rapid proliferation of CD8+ T cells is decisive in the severity of the disease.",Rodolfo Blanco-Rodriguez; Xin Du; Esteban A.

50,New detection of SARS-CoV-2 in two cats height months after COVID-19 outbreak appearance in France,"Although there are several reports in the literature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats, few SARS-CoV-2 sequences from infected cats have been published. In this report, SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in two cats by clinical observation, molecular biology (qPCR and NGS), and serology (Microsphere immunoassay and seroneutralization). Following the observation of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infection in two cats, infection status was confirmed by RT-qPCR and, in one cat, serological analysis for antibodies against N-protein and S-protein, as well as neutralizing antibodies. Comparative analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 sequence-fragments obtained from one of the cats showed that this infection was not with one of the three recently emerged variants of SARS-CoV-2.

51,Factors Associated with Emerging and Re-emerging of SARS-CoV-2 Variants,"Global spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered unprecedented scientific efforts, as well as containment and treatment measures. Despite these efforts, SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unmanageable in some parts of the world. Due to inherent mutability of RNA viruses, it is not surprising that the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been continuously evolving since its emergence. Recently, four functionally distinct variants, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C, have been identified, and they appear to more infectious and transmissible than the original (Wuhan-Hu-1) virus. Here we provide evidence based upon a combination of bioinformatics and structural approaches that can explain the higher infectivity of the new variants. Our results show that the greater infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV can be attributed to a combination of several factors, including alternate receptors. Additionally, we show that new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of D614G in Spike protein and P323L in RNA polymerase. The correlation analyses showed that all mutations in specific variants did not evolve simultaneously. Instead, some mutations evolved most likely to compensate for the viral fitness.",Austin N Spratt; Saathvik K Kannan; Lucas T Woods; Gary A Weisman; Thomas D Quinn; Christian L Lorson; Anders Sonnerborg; Siddappa N Byrareddy; Kamal Singh,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436850,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436850,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,False
52,Arginine Methylation Regulates SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Function and Viral Replication,"Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) playing critical roles during viral infections. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG sequences. Arginine methylation of N protein was confirmed by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated by cell culture. We demonstrate that arginine methylation of N protein is required for its RNA binding capacity, since treatment with a type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95K or R177K inhibited interaction with the 5-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. We defined the N interactome in HEK293 cells with or without MS023 treatment and identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates including the known interactor, G3BP1, and other components of stress granules (SG). Methylation of N protein at R95 regulates another function namely its property to suppress the formation of SGs. MS023 treatment or R95K substitution blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the co-expression of methylarginine reader TDRD3 quenched N-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pre-treatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. With type I PRMT inhibitors being in clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may be an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.",Ting Cai; Zhenbao Yu; Zhen Wang; Chen Liang; Stephane Richard,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436822,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436822,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,False
53,"Rapid, widespread, and preferential increase of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in Houston, TX, revealed by 8,857 genome sequences","Genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have become of great interest worldwide because they have the potential to detrimentally alter the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and disease in individual patients. We recently sequenced 20,453 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients with COVID-19 disease in metropolitan Houston (population 7 million), dating from March 2020 to early February 2021. We discovered that all major variants of concern or interest are circulating in the region. To follow up on this discovery, we analyzed 8,857 genome sequences from patients in eight Houston Methodist hospitals dispersed throughout the metroplex diagnosed from January 1, 2021 to March 7, 2021. This sample represents 94% of Houston Methodist cases and 4.8% of all reported cases in metropolitan Houston during this period. We discovered rapid, widespread, and preferential increase of the SARS-CoV-2 UK B.1.1.7 throughout the region. The estimated case doubling time in the Houston area is 6.9 days.

54,An automated Dashboard to improve laboratory COVID-19 diagnostics management,"Background: In response to the CoVID-19 pandemic, our microbial diagnostic laboratory located in a university hospital has implemented several distinct SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR systems in a very short time. Thanks to our automated molecular diagnostic platform, more than 140 000 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were achieved over 12 months, with peaks higher than 1 500 daily tests. A dashboard was developed to give access to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to improve laboratory operational management. Methods: RT-PCR data extraction of four respiratory viruses - SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B and RSV - from our laboratory information system (LIS), was automated. Important KPIs were identified and the visualization was achieved using an in-house dashboard based on the open-source language R (Shiny). Information is updated every 4 hours. Results: The dashboard is organized into three main parts. The Filter page presents all the KPIs, divided into five sections: i) general and gender-related indicators, ii) number of tests and positivity rate, iii) cycle threshold and viral load, iv) test durations, and v) not valid results. Filtering allows to select a given period, a dedicated instrument, a given specimen, or a requester for instance. The Comparison page allows a custom charting of all the available variables, which represents more than 182 combinations. The Data page gives the user access to the raw data in table format, with the possibility of filtering, allowing for a deeper analysis and data download in Excel format. Conclusions: The dashboard, that gives a rapid access to a huge number of up-to-date information, represents a reliable and user-friendly tool improving the decision-making process, resource planning and quality management.

55,Low prevalence of COVID-19 Exposure is Coincident with Self-reported Compliance with Public Health Guidelines among Essential Employees at an Institute of Higher Education,"Importance: Detailed analysis of infection rates paired with behavioral and employee reported risk factors are vital to understanding how COVID-19 transmission may be inflamed or mitigated in the workplace. Institutes of Higher Education are heterogeneous work units that supported continued in person employment during COVID-19, providing an excellent test site for occupational health evaluation. Objective: To evaluate self-reported behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 among essential in-person employees during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional, conducted from July 13- September 2, 2020. Setting: Institute of Higher Education in Fort Collins, Colorado. Participants: Employees identified to be an essential in-person employee during the first six months of the pandemic (1,522 invited, 1,507 qualified, 603 (40%) completed the survey). Of those completing the survey, 84.2% (508) elected to participate in blood and nasal swab sample collection to assess active SARS-CoV-2 infection via qRT-PCR, and past infection by serology (overall completion rate of 33.7%). Eligibility included > 18 years old, able to read and understand English, not currently experiencing cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever >100.4F (38C), chills/shaking with chills, muscle pain, new or worsening headaches, sore throat or new loss of sense of taste/smell. Exposure: Self-reported COVID-19 protective behaviors Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Current SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by qRT-PCR or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by IgG SARS-CoV-2 testing platform. Results: There were no qRT-PCR positive tests, and only 2 (0.39%) contained seroreactive IgG antibodies. Participants were 60% female, 90% non-Hispanic white, mean age 41 years (18-70 years). Handwashing and mask wearing were reported frequently both at work (98% and 94% respectively) and outside work (91% and 95% respectively) while social distancing was reported less frequently at work (79%) then outside of work (92%) [p < .001]. Participants were more highly motivated to avoid exposures out of concern for spreading to others (83%) than for personal implications (63%) [ p < .001].

However, it is unknown whether these signatures in ME/CFS include abnormal levels of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE and ACE2, the latter being the main receptor described for host-cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2. To investigate that, we first reviewed published case-control genome-wide association studies based on single nucleotide polymorphism data, case-control epigenome-wide association studies based on DNA methylation data, and case-control gene expression studies based on microarray data. From these published studies, we did not find any evidence for a difference between patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls in terms of genetic variation, DNA methylation, and gene expression levels of ACE and ACE2. In line with this evidence, the analysis of a new data set on the ACE/ACE2 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not find any differences between a female cohort of 37 patients and 34 age-matched healthy controls. Future studies should be conducted to extend this investigation to other potential receptors used by SARS-CoV-2.

57,"The role of classroom volume, natural ventilation and voice reduction in transmission risk of SARS-CoV2 in schools","School classrooms are enclosed settings where students and teachers spend prolonged periods of time and therefore risky environments for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV2. While countries worldwide have been pursuing different school reopening strategies, most countries are planning to keep schools open during the whole winter season 2020/21. This poses a controversial issue: ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to sensibly decrease due to outdoor temperatures getting colder and regulators going to allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. Moreover, most schools are not provided with mechanical ventilation/filtartion systems to date. Fundamental and urgent questions to be addressed are therefore: to which extent can we contain the airborne transmission risk in schools through natural ventilation only? can we reduce the airborne risk with easy to implement countermeasures like lowering the speaking volume? To answer these questions a theoretical risk model based on the emission rate of viral charge from an infective subject has been developed extending previous models for tubercolosis and influenza. The case of an infective student or an infective teacher in a classroom, as well as an infective teacher with microphone have been investigated and compared with infection thresholds for different group sizes. The model also considers the influence of indoor-outdoor temperature difference on the air exchange rate, which seems to be particularly strong during winter.",Alessandro Zivelonghi; Massimo Lai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21253503,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21253503,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
58,"Physical, cognitive and mental health impacts of COVID-19 following hospitalisation: a multi-centre prospective cohort study","Background The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, and employment following hospitalisation is poorly understood. Methods PHOSP-COVID is a multi-centre, UK, observational study of adults discharged from hospital with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 involving an assessment between two- and seven-months later including detailed symptom, physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for patient-perceived recovery with age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, and severity of acute illness as co-variates. Cluster analysis was performed using outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognition and physical function. Findings We report findings of 1077 patients discharged in 2020, from the assessment undertaken a median 5 [IQR4 to 6] months later: 36% female, mean age 58 [SD 13] years, 69% white ethnicity, 27% mechanical ventilation, and 50% had at least two co-morbidities. At follow-up only 29% felt fully recovered, 20% had a new disability, and 19% experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with failure to recover were female, middle-age, white ethnicity, two or more co-morbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial and weakly related to acute severity. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment: 1) Very severe (17%), 2) Severe (21%), 3) Moderate with cognitive impairment (17%), 4) Mild (46%), with 3%, 7%, 36% and 43% feeling fully recovered, respectively. Persistent systemic inflammation determined by C-reactive protein was related to cluster severity, but not acute illness severity. Interpretation We identified factors related to recovery from a hospital admission with COVID-19 and four different phenotypes relating to the severity of physical, mental, and cognitive health five months later. The implications for clinical care include the potential to stratify care and the need for a pro-active approach with wide-access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services.

60,Economic Crisis and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan,"Background The economic crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic can have a serious impact on population mental health. This study seeks to understand whether the economic shocks associated with the pandemic have a differential impact by sex because the current pandemic may have disproportionally affected women compared to men. Methods We analyzed data from original online monthly surveys of the general population in Japan conducted between April 2020 and February 2021 (N=9000). We investigate whether individuals who had experienced a major job-related were more likely to have experienced depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and anxiety disorders (GAD-7) during the pandemic and also if its effect varied by sex. Results The results of logistic regression suggest that depressive and anxiety symptoms were more prevalent among those who had recently experienced drastic changes in employment and working conditions, as well as among individuals with low income and those without college education. We also found that female respondents who had experienced a major employment-related change were more likely to have experienced both depression and anxiety disorders, but its effect on male workers was limited to depressive symptoms. Limitations We do not have data on the pre-COVID mental health conditions of our respondents, and our findings are descriptive. Some segments of the population may not be represented in our sample because our surveys were conducted online. Conclusions COVID-induced economic shocks can have a differential detrimental effect on mental health depending on the sex of workers.

61,Management of COVID-19-related Arterial Thrombosis Leading to Acute Limb-threatening Ischemia,"Objective: Examine the occurrence and clinical outcomes of arterial thrombosis leading to limb- threatening ischemia in patients with coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). Study design: Prospective, descriptive case series. Patients and Methods: Forty-four patients with COVID-19 infection presenting with critical limb ischemia were managed between March 2020 and December 2020. The patients were divided into three groups based on the mode of presentation: 1) those who had been admitted; 2) those presenting in the emergency department; and 3) those presenting to vascular clinics. Clinical evidence suggesting limb ischemia was evaluated with computerized tomographic angiogram. Vascular care was designed according to the need of individual patients, through anticoagulation, revascularization by thrombo-embolectomy, or bypass grafting and amputation. Results: Ten major amputations and 4 deaths (all in patients admitted) occurred among the 44 patients (9.1%). Most patients (32/44) were males, mean age was 55, and limb ischemia occurred among patients as young as 29. The initial period of ischemia was often not appreciated by patients and physicians. Critical limb ischemia was often not correlated with the severity of COVD symptoms: of 17 patients who presented through the emergency room with limb-threatening ischemia, 10 (58.9%) were asymptomatic for respiratory and general symptoms. Comorbidities were common among all 3 patient groups (26/44; 59%). Anticoagulants did not consistently prevent thromboembolic events since all admitted patients were receiving low molecular weight heparin. The rate of revascularization was lower in this population than in the general population with similar limb ischemia. Conclusion: Acute limb ischemia in patients with COVID-19 is a vascular emergency that can result in limb loss and even death. The severity of respiratory infection and other symptoms of COVID often are not consistent with the severity and level of vascular involvement. Timely recognition and tailored intervention is needed to save limbs in this population.",Not available,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21252888,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21252888,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
62,What Explains the Socioeconomic Status-Health Gradient? Evidence from Workplace COVID-19 Infections,"This paper studies the contribution of the workplace to the SES-health gradient. Our analysis is based on a unique dataset that tracks various health outcomes and workplace risks among healthcare workers during the first four months of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The setting provides an exceptional opportunity to test for work-related disparities in health, while controlling for confounding determinants of the SES-health gradient. We find that low-SES nurses were systematically more likely to contract COVID-19 as a result of workplace exposure. These differentials existed in all healthcare institutions, but were particularly large in non-hospital settings. In contrast, we find no relationship between SES and non work-related infection rates. The differences in workplace infection rates are substantially larger than those implied by standard 'task-based' indices of transmission risk, and cannot be attributable to easily identifiable metrics of workplace risk. Together, our results show how subtle differences in work conditions or job duties can substantially contribute to the SES-health gradient.",Not available,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254170,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254170,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
63,Incidence of and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among people living with HIV in Southern Spain,"Background: Whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are at greater risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently unknown. Prospective serologic studies may allow seroincidence analyses, where all infections are accurately identified. Because of this, we evaluated the incidence of and associated factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH in Southern Spain. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study including PLWH from a University Hospital in Southern Spain. Patients were enrolled if 1) they had attended as outpatients our Unit from August 1st, 2019 to February 8th, 2020; 2) had two subsequent evaluations from February 9th, 2020 to February 15th, 2021. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were determined in baseline and intra-pandemic samples. Results: 710 PLWH were included in the study. Of them, 46 [6.5%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4.8%-8.5%] patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Between May 18th and November 29th, 2020, the rate of seroconversion was 5.3% (95% CI: 3.1%-9%) for the general population in the area of Seville and 2.3% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.6%) for PLWH in this study (p=0.001). After multivariate analysis, adjusted by age and sex, active tobacco smoking was the only factor independently associated with lower risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (Incidence rate ratio 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18-0.68, p=0.002). Conclusions: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH in Southern Spain during the ongoing pandemic was lower than that reported for the general population in the same area. Tobacco smoking was the only factor independently associated with a lower risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Not available,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21253397,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21253397,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
64,Serious adverse events reported from the COVID-19 vaccines: A descriptive study based on WHO database,"Background: In the light of the current pandemic, the emergency approval of few COVID-19 vaccines seems to provide a ray of hope. However, their approval is solely based on limited data available from the clinical trials in a short period of time; thereby imposing a necessity to study the adverse events (AEs) associated with their use. This study therefore aims to assess the Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) associated with various COVID 19 vaccines reported in the WHO database (VigiBase). Methods: The data from VigiBase was analyzed to assess the reported SAEs linked to various COVID 19 vaccines. The duplicates in the data were removed and were analyzed on the basis of age, gender, and seriousness of adverse events at the System Organ Classification (SOC) level and the individual Preferred Term (PT) level. Results: A total 103954 adverse events reported from 32044 subjects were taken for analysis. Of 32044 subjects, majority were females (80%). Also, a total of 28799 (27.7%) SAEs were reported from the 8007 individuals. Most of the SAEs were reported from Europe (83%), amongst females (79.4%) and between 18 to 64 years (80.74%) of age. Majority of SAEs (74%) were reported for BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine. On system wise classification, general disorders (30%) were the commonest followed by nervous system (19.1%) and musculoskeletal (11.2%) disorders. In individual category, headache (8.1%) was the commonest, followed by pyrexia (7%) and fatigue (5.1%). The number of SAEs were reported with various vaccines were comparatively lesser as compared to the non-serious ones and incidence of death was low with all the vaccines candidates. Elderly (> 65 years) people reported more serious SAEs as compared to other age groups. Conclusion: The reported SAEs from the COVID 19 vaccines were in line with the data published in clinical trials. To link these SAEs to vaccines will need causality analysis and review of individual reports.",Not available,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21253433,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21253433,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
65,Evaluation of the ROX index in SARS-CoV-2 Acute Respiratory failure treated with both High-Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP),"Background: Non-invasive respiratory support including high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been used to provide therapy in selected SARS-CoV-2 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). The value of the ROX index, a validated benchmark for outcomes in HFNO is unknown in CPAP. Objective: Can the ROX, a validated benchmark in HFNO be used for measuring treatment outcomes of CPAP in SARS-COV-2 ARF? Study Design and Methods: A non-randomised prospective protocol driven observational non-intensive care unit study in 130 SARS-COV-2 patients with ARF treated with non-invasive therapy from March 2020 to January 2021. The primary end point was failure of therapy (death or escalation). Secondary outcomes included time to failure including invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death, the effect of escalation to CPAP from HFNO and the utility of ROX in ARF. Results: HFNO was better than CPAP in treating SARS-COV-2 ARF: 17/35 (48.5%) with successful HFNO therapy versus 24/95 (25.2%) with CPAP. The ROX index was more sensitive to outcomes with CPAP compared to HFNO and distinguished treatment failure early at 1, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours with the highest sensitivity at 24 hours (ROX-24h). The AUC for the ROX-24h was 0.77 for HFNO (P<0.0001), and 0.84 for CPAP (P<0.0001). The ROX-24h cut-points predicted failure with HFNO when < 3.9 (PPV 71%, NPV 75%) and CPAP < 4.3 (PPV 75%, NPV 91%). For success, ROX-24h cut-points of 7.6 for HFNO (PPV 85%, NPV 48%) and 6.1 for CPAP (PPV 88%, NPV 62%) were observed. Escalation from HFNO to CPAP was mostly not successful. Conclusion: ARF in SARS-COV-2 can be successfully managed by non-invasive support. The ROX index, validated for HFNO, provides a timely, low resource measure for both HFNO and CPAP avoiding delayed intubation.

67,"COVID-19 Infection Risk amongst 14,104 Vaccinated Care Home Residents: A national observational longitudinal cohort study in Wales, United Kingdom, December 2020 to March 2021","Background: Vaccinations for COVID-19 have been prioritised for older people living in care homes. However, vaccination trials included limited numbers of older people. Aim: We aimed to study infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 for older care home residents following vaccination and identify factors associated with increased risk of infection. Study Design and Setting: We conducted an observational data-linkage study including 14,104 vaccinated older care home residents in Wales (UK) using anonymised electronic health records and administrative data. Methods: We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination, after landmark times of either 7 or 21-days post-vaccination. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, sex, frailty, prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination type. Results: We observed a small proportion of care home residents with positive PCR tests following vaccination 1.05% (N=148), with 90% of infections occurring within 28-days. For the 7-day landmark analysis we found a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals who had a previous infection; HR (95% confidence interval) 0.54 (0.30,0.95), and an increased HR for those receiving the Pfizer-BioNTECH vaccine compared to the Oxford-AstraZeneca; 3.83 (2.45,5.98). For the 21-day landmark analysis we observed high HRs for individuals with low and intermediate frailty compared to those without; 4.59 (1.23,17.12) and 4.85 (1.68,14.04) respectively. Conclusions: Increased risk of infection after 21-days was associated with frailty.

68,COVID-19 therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries: a review of re-purposed candidate agents with potential for near-term use and impact,"Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face significant challenges in the control of COVID-19, given limited resources, especially for inpatient care. In a parallel effort to that for vaccines, the identification of therapeutics that have near-term potential to be available and easily administered is critical. Using the United States, European Union, and World Health Organization clinical trial registries, we reviewed COVID-19 therapeutic agents currently under investigation. The search was limited to oral or potentially oral agents, with at least a putative anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus mechanism, and with at least 3 registered trials. We describe the available evidence regarding agents that met these criteria and additionally discuss the need for additional investment by the global scientific community in large well-coordinated trials of accessible agents and their combinations in LMICs. The search yielded 636, 175, and 930 trials, in the US, EU, and WHO trial registers, respectively. These trials covered 17 oral or potentially oral repurposed agents that are currently used as antimicrobials and immunomodulatory therapeutics and therefore have established safety. The available evidence regarding proposed mechanism of actions, clinical efficacy, and potential limitations is summarized. We also identified the need for large well-coordinated trials of accessible agents and their combinations in LMICs. Several repurposed agents have potential to be safe, available, and easily administrable to treat COVID-19.

69,The Effect of Famotidine on Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Introduction: Famotidine is a competitive histamine H2-receptor antagonist most commonly used for gastric acid suppression but thought to have potential efficacy in treating patients with COVID-19. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to summarize the current literature and report clinical outcomes on the use of famotidine for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Five databases were searched through February 12, 2021 to identify observational studies that reported on associations of famotidine use with outcomes in COVID-19. Meta-analysis was conducted for composite primary clinical outcome (e.g. rate of death, intubation, or intensive care unit admissions) and death separately, where either aggregate odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) was calculated. Results: Four studies, reporting on 46,435 total patients and 3,110 patients treated with famotidine, were included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant association between famotidine use and composite outcomes in patients with COVID-19: HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.16). Across the three studies that reported mortality separated from other endpoints, there was no association between famotidine use during hospitalization and risk of death - HR 0.67 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.73) and OR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.19, 3.34). Heterogeneity ranged from 83.69% to 88.07%. Conclusion: Based on the existing observational studies, famotidine use is not associated with a reduced risk of mortality or combined outcome of mortality, intubation, and/or intensive care services in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19, though heterogeneity was high, and point estimates suggested a possible protective effect for the composite outcome that may not have been observed due to lack of power.

72,The Impact of Vaccination to Control COVID-19 Burden in the United States: A Simulation Modeling Approach,"Introduction: Vaccination programs aim to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the relative impacts of vaccine coverage, effectiveness, and capacity in the context of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask use and physical distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are unclear. Our objective was to examine the impact of vaccination on the control of SARS-CoV-2 using our previously developed agent-based simulation model. Methods: We applied our agent-based model to replicate COVID-19-related events in 1) Dane County, Wisconsin; 2) Milwaukee metropolitan area, Wisconsin; 3) New York City (NYC). We evaluated the impact of vaccination considering the proportion of the population vaccinated, probability that a vaccinated individual gains immunity, vaccination capacity, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. The primary outcomes were the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the timing of pandemic control, defined as the date after which only a small number of new cases occur. We also estimated the number of cases without vaccination. Results: The timing of pandemic control depends highly on vaccination coverage, effectiveness, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. In Dane County and Milwaukee, if 50% of the population is vaccinated with a daily vaccination capacity of 0.1% of the population, vaccine effectiveness of 90%, and the adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions is 85%, controlled spread could be achieved by July 2021 and August 2021, respectively versus in March 2022 in both regions without vaccine. If adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions increases to 70%, controlled spread could be achieved by May 2021 and April 2021 in Dane County and Milwaukee, respectively. Discussion: In controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of vaccination varies widely depending not only on effectiveness and coverage, but also concurrent adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions.

73,Epicardial adipose tissue thickness is associated with increased severity and mortality related to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUND: Obesity, in particular, visceral adipose tissue has been linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The amount of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may have relevant implications given its proximity to the heart and lungs. Here, we explored the role of EAT in increasing the risk for COVID-19 adverse outcomes. METHODS: We included 748 patients with COVID-19 attending a reference centre in Mexico City. EAT thickness, sub-thoracic and pericardial fat were measured using thoracic CT scans. We explored the association of each thoracic adipose tissue compartment with critical COVID-19 and mortality according to the presence or absence of obesity. Mediation analyses evaluated the role of EAT in facilitating the effect of age, body mass index and cardiac troponin levels with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: EAT thickness was associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (HR 1.18, 95%CI 1.01-1.39) independent of age, gender, comorbid conditions and BMI. Increased EAT was associated with lower SpO2 and PaFi index and higher levels of cardiac troponins, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and 4C severity score, independent of obesity. EAT mediated 13.1% (95%CI 3.67-28.0%) and 5.1% (95%CI 0.19-14.0%) of the effect of age and 19.4% (95%CI 4.67-63.0%) and 12.8% (95%CI 0.03-46.0%) of the effect of BMI on requirement for intubation and mortality, respectively. EAT also mediated the effect of increased cardiac troponins on myocardial infarction during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: EAT is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 and mortality independent of obesity. EAT partly mediates the effect of age and BMI and increased cardiac troponins on adverse COVID-19 outcomes.",Roopa Mehta; Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla; Leonardo Mancillas-Adame; Marcela Rodríguez-Flores; Natalia Ramírez-Pedraza; Bethsabel Rodríguez-Encinas; Carolina Isabel Pérez-Carrión; María Isabel Jasso-Ávila; Jorge Valladares-Garcia; Pablo Esteban Vanegas-Cedillo; Diana Hernández-Juárez; Arsenio Vargas-Vázquez; Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa; Monica Chapa-Ibarguengoitia; Paloma Almeda-Vald	és; Daniel Elias-Lopez; Arturo Galindo-Fraga; Alfonso Gulias-Herrero; Alfredo Ponce de Leon; Jose Sifuentes-Osornio; Carlos A.

In the current study, grab sampling of primary influent was performed every 2 hours over two different 24-hour periods at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in northern Indiana, USA. In primary influent, uncorrected, recovery-corrected, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)-normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations demonstrated ordinal agreement with increasing clinical COVID-19 positivity, but not COVID-19 cases. Primary influent SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations exhibited greater variation than PMMoV RNA concentrations as expected for lower shedding prevalence. The bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) process control recovery efficiency was low (mean: 0.91%) and highly variable (coefficient of variation: 51% - 206%) over the four sampling events with significant differences between the two WWTPs (p <0.0001). The process control recovery was similar to the independently assessed SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovery efficiency, which was also significantly different between the two WWTPs (p <0.0001). Recovery-corrected SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations better reflected within-day changes in primary influent flow rate and fecal content, as indicated by PMMoV concentrations. These observations highlight the importance of assessing the process recovery efficiency, which is highly variable, using an appropriate process control. Despite large variations, both recovery-corrected and PMMoV-normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary influent demonstrate potential for monitoring COVID-19 positivity trends in WWTPs serving peri-urban and rural areas.",Aaron Bivins; Devin North; Zhenyu Wu; Marlee Shaffer; Warish Ahmed; Kyle James Bibby,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253652,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253652,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
75,A SIRD model applied to COVID-19 dynamics and intervention strategies during the first wave in Kenya,"The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Kenya in March 2020 and soon after non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were established to control the spread of the disease. The NPIs consisted, and continue to consist, of mitigation measures followed by a period of relaxation of some of the measures. In this paper, we use a deterministic mathematical model to analyze the dynamics of the disease, during the first wave, and relate it to the intervention measures. In the process, we develop a new method for estimating the disease parameters. Our solutions yield a basic reproduction number, R0 = 2.76, which is consistent with other solutions. The results further show that the initial mitigation reduced disease transmission by 40% while the subsequent relaxation increased transmission by 25%. We also propose a mathematical model on how interventions of known magnitudes collectively affect disease transmission rates. The modelled positivity rate curve compares well with observations. If interventions of unknown magnitudes have occurred, and data is available on the positivity rate, we use the method of planar envelopes around a curve to deduce the modelled positivity rate and the magnitudes of the interventions. Our solutions deduce mitigation and relaxation effects of 42.5% and 26%, respectively; these percentages are close to values obtained by the solution of the SIRD system. Our methods so far apply to a single wave; there is a need to investigate the possibility of extending them to handle multiple waves.",Wandera Ogana; Victor Ogesa Juma; Wallace D.

76,Curtailing Covid-19 on a Dollar-a-Day in Malawi: Implications for the Ongoing Pandemic,"Utilizing population-based data from the Covid-19 phone survey (N=2,262) of the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) collected during June 2nd--August 17th, 2020, we investigate behavioral, economic and social responses to Covid-19 and focus on the crucial role that community leadership and trust in institutions play towards shaping these responses. We argue that the effective response of Malawi to limit the spread of the virus was facilitated by the engagement of local leaders to mobilize communities to adapt and adhere to Covid-19 prevention strategies. Village heads (VHs) played pivotal role in shaping individual's knowledge about the pandemic and the adaption of preventive health behaviors and were crucial for mitigating the negative economic and health consequences of the pandemic. We further show that trust in institutions is of particular importance in shaping individuals' behavior during the pandemic, and these findings highlight the pivotal role of community leadership in fostering better compliance and adoption of public health measures essential to contain the virus. Overall, our findings point to distinctive patterns of pandemic response in a low-income sub-Saharan African rural population that emphasized local leadership as mediators of public health messages and policies. These lessons from the first pandemic wave remain relevant as in many low-income countries behavioral responses to Covid-19 will remain the primary prevention strategy for a foreseeable future.",Iliana V.

77,Molecular Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Cyprus,"Whole genome sequencing of viral specimens following molecular diagnosis is a powerful analytical tool of molecular epidemiology that can critically assist in resolving chains of transmission, identifying of new variants or assessing pathogen evolution and allows a real-time view into the dynamics of a pandemic. In Cyprus, the first two cases of COVID-19 were identified on March 9, 2020 and since then 33,567 confirmed cases and 230 deaths were documented. In this study, viral whole genome sequencing was performed on 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected between March 2020 and January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. 15 different lineages were identified that clustered into three groups associated with the spring, summer and autumn/winter wave of SARS-CoV2 incidence in Cyprus, respectively. The majority of the Cypriot samples belonged to the B.1.258 lineage first detected in September that spread rapidly and largely dominated the autumn/winter wave with a peak prevalence of 86% during the months of November and December. The B.1.1.7 UK variant (VOC-202012/01) was identified for the first time at the end of December and spread rapidly reaching 37% prevalence within one month. Overall, we describe the changing pattern of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus since the beginning of the pandemic until the end of January 2021. These findings highlight the role of importation of new variants through travel towards the emergence of successive waves of incidence in Cyprus and demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance in determining viral genetic diversity and the timely identification of new variants for guiding public health intervention measures.",Jan Richter; Pavlos Fanis; Christina Tryfonos; Dana Koptides; George Krashias; Stavros Bashiardes; Andreas Hadjisavvas; Maria Loizidou; Anastasis Oulas; Denise Alexandrou; Olga Kalakouta; Mihalis I Panayiotidis; George M Spyrou; Christina Christodoulou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21252974,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21252974,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
78,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic dynamics and infection tracing in Denmark,"We model and simulate the COVID-19 infection and healthcare dynamics in Denmark from the onset till March 5, 2021. The simulation is matched and calibrated to hospital and death data as well as antibody population measurement. In this work we focus on comparing the time evolution of the estimated infection level with the daily identified infected individuals based on the national testing and contact tracing program. We find that the national testing program on average identifies 1/3 of the infected individuals July 1, 2020 - March 5, 2021. Our investigations indicate the current program does not have a proper balance between random probing, focused contact tracing, and testing prioritization. Too much of the program operates as a semi-random daily sampling of part of the population. We propose a policy with a focus on local infection tracing and interventions.",Morten W. N.

79,Alpha-1 blockers and susceptibility to COVID-19 in benign prostate hyperplasia patients : an international cohort study,"Alpha-1 blockers, often used to treat benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), have been hypothesized to prevent COVID-19 complications by minimising cytokine storms release. We conducted a prevalent-user active-comparator cohort study to assess association between alpha-1 blocker use and risks of three COVID-19 outcomes: diagnosis, hospitalization, and hospitalization requiring intensive services. Our study included 2.6 and 0.46 million users of alpha-1 blockers and of alternative BPH therapy during the period between November 2019 and January 2020, found in electronic health records from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United States (Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, IQVIA OpenClaims, Optum DOD, Optum EHR). We estimated hazard ratios using state-of-the-art techniques to minimize potential confounding, including large-scale propensity score matching/stratification and negative control calibration.

80,Pre-pandemic Cognitive Function and COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Prospective Cohort Study,"Importance: Whereas several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been examined, the role of cognitive function following the widely publicised development of an inoculation is unknown. Objective: To test the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within Understanding Society (Main Survey). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. To summarise our results, we computed odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals for general cognitive function adjusted for selected covariates. Results: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N=1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p<0.0001). Conclusions and Relevance: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability test scores being vaccine-hesitant. With people with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.",George David Batty; Ian Deary; Chloe Fawns-Ritchie; Catharine Gale; Drew Altschul,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253634,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253634,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
81,Forecasting the Epidemiological Impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Pre-vaccination Era,"Background: During this pandemic, many studies have been published on the virology, diagnosis, prevention, and control of the novel coronavirus. However, fewer studies are currently available on the quantitative future epidemiological impacts. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to forecast the COVID-19 morbidities and associated-mortalities among the top 20 countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally prior to vaccination intervention. Method: We conducted a secondary data analysis of the prospective geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases data worldwide as of 10 April 2020. The historical data was forecasted using Exponential-Smoothing to detect seasonality patterns and confidence intervals surrounding each predicted value in which 95 percent of the future points are expected to fall based on the forecast. Results: The total mean forecasted cases and deaths were 99,823 and 8,801. Interestingly, the US has the highest forecasted cases, deaths, and percentage cases-deaths ratio of 45,338, 2 358, and 5.20% respectively. China has the lowest cases, deaths, and percentage cases-deaths ratio -267, -2, and 0.75% respectively. In addition, France has the highest forecasted percentage cases-deaths ratio of 26.40% with forecasted cases, and deaths of 6,246, and 1,649 respectively.

82,COVID-19 in Children with Brain-Based Developmental Disabilities: A Rapid Review Update,"Objective: Information regarding the impact of COVID-19 in children with brain-based disabilities, or those at risk of developing such conditions, remains scarce. The objective was to evaluate if children with brain-based disabilities are more likely to (1) develop COVID-19, (2) develop complications from the disease, and (3) to have a poorer prognosis. Study design: We conducted a rapid review using search strategies iteratively developed and tested by an experienced medical information specialist in consultation with the review team and a panel of knowledge users. Searches were initially performed on April 18th, 2021, and updated on October 31st, 2020. Four reviewers individually performed study selection using pilot-tested standardized forms. Single reviewers extracted the data using a standardized extraction form that included study characteristics, patients' characteristics, and outcomes reported. Results: We identified 1448 publications, of which 29 were included. Studies reported data on 2288 COVID-19 positive children, including 462 with a brain-based disability, and 72 at risk of developing such disability. Overall, the included studies showed a greater risk to develop severe COVID-19 disease in children with brain-based disabilities. Although mortality is very low, the case-fatality rate appeared to be higher in children with disabilities compared to children without disabilities. Conclusions: Our review shows that children with brain-based disabilities are overrepresented in hospitalization numbers compared to children without disabilities. However, most studies included children that were hospitalized from COVID-19 in secondary and tertiary care centers. Results of this review should therefore be interpreted with caution.",Michèle Dugas; Théo Stéfan; Johanie Lépine; Patrick Blouin; Andrée-Anne Poirier; Valérie Carnovale; Benoit Mailhot; Becky Skidmore; Lena Faust; Carrie Costello; Donna Thomson; Annette Majnemer; Dan Goldowitz; Steven P.

83,Characterizing Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection across Claims and Electronic Health Record Databases,"Structured Abstract Importance: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is emerging as a major public health issue. Objective: We characterized the incidence of PASC, or related symptoms and diagnoses, for COVID-19 and influenza patients. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Our data sources were the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), Optum Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) databases that were transformed to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and were part of the Observational Health Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. Participants: The COVID-19 cohort consisted of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or positive lab test of SARS-CoV-2 after January 1st 2020 with a follow up period of at least 30 days. The influenza cohort consisted of patients with a diagnosis of influenza between October 1, 2018 and May 1, 2019 with a follow up period of at least 30 days. Intervention: Infection with COVID-19 or influenza. Main Outcomes and Measures: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or related diagnoses, for COVID-19 and influenza patients. Results: In aggregate, we characterized the post-acute experience for over 440,000 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for SARS-COV-2. The long term sequelae that had a higher incidence in the COVID-19 compared to Influenza cohorts were altered smell or taste, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea and alopecia. Additionally, the long term incidences of respiratory illness, musculoskeletal disease, and psychiatric disorders for the COVID-19 population were higher than expected.

84,Chronic diseases: Perceptions about Covid-19 risk and vaccination,"Background Individuals with chronic disease may be at higher risk of dying from COVID-19, yet no association has been established between chronic illness and COVID-19 risk perception, engagement with nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), or vaccine acceptance. Methods We surveyed US residents who self-reported a chronic respiratory or autoimmune disease in February 2021. Respondents reported beliefs about the risk of COVID-19 to personal and public health, adoption and support of NPIs, willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and reasons for vaccination willingness. We evaluated the association between disease status and COVID-19 behaviors or attitudes, adjusting for demographic and political factors. Results Compared to healthy controls, chronic disease was associated with increased belief that COVID-19 was a personal (Respiratory = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.10 - 0.15; Autoimmune = 0.11, CI = 0.08 - 0.14) and public threat (Respiratory = 0.04, CI = 0.02 - 0.06; Autoimmune = 0.03, CI = 0.01 - 0.06), and support for NPIs. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with willingness to be vaccinated (0.6, CI = 0.05 - 0.09). Personal protection was associated with vaccination (Respiratory = 1.08, CI = 1.03 - 1.13; Autoimmune = 1.06, CI = 1.01 - 1.11). Autoimmune disease was associated with fear of a bad vaccine reaction (1.22, CI = 1.06 - 1.41) among those unwilling to be vaccinated. Conclusions In the US, chronic disease status is significantly related to risk perceptions of COVID, support of personal and community risk mitigation measures, and willingness to be vaccinated.",Emily E Ricotta; Jennifer L Kwan; Brianna A Smith; Nicholas G Evans,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253760,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253760,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
85,"Background rates of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits among nursing home residents in Ontario, Canada to inform COVID-19 vaccine safety assessments","Background. Nursing home (NH) residents have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and are prioritized for vaccination. NH residents are generally at increased risk of poor outcomes due to advanced age, frailty, and complex health conditions. We report monthly incidence rates of deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits during ten pre-pandemic years (2010-2019) and 2020 to provide context for assessments of COVID-19 vaccine safety in NH residents. Methods. We observed deaths, hospitalizations, and ED visits among all Ontarians living in NHs using health administrative databases. Monthly incidence rates were calculated by month, by sex, and by age group. Direct comparisons between months were assessed using one-sample t-tests; direct comparisons by age and sex were assessed using chi-squared tests. Results. From January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2019, there were, on average, 83,453 (SD: 652.4) Ontarians living in NHs in any given month, with an average of 2.3 (SD: 0.28) deaths, 3.1 (SD: 0.16) hospitalizations, and 3.6 (SD: 0.17) ED visits per 100 residents per month. Mortality rates were higher for men (p<0.001) and residents aged [&ge;]80 years (p<0.001). Hospitalization and ED visit rates were higher for men but were lower for residents aged [&ge;]80 years. From January to October 2020, the number of NH residents declined markedly. Mortality rates were increased in 2020 compared to 2010-2019, but hospitalization and ED visit rates were reduced in 2020 compared to 2010-2019 (p<0.001). Conclusion. We identified relatively consistent monthly mortality, hospitalization, and ED visit rates during ten pre-pandemic years. Marked differences in these rates were observed during 2020, coinciding with heightened COID-19 infection rates and restrictions.

86,High incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"Introduction SARS-CoV-2 infected patients present thrombotic complications caused by direct endothelial cells injury of the microvessels. Pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) has been reported by Computed Tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with high D-dimer levels. Objectives We present the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients diagnosed of PE by CTPA in our hospital. We also present the comparison of these findings with non-infected patients with PE data. Methods Patients 18 years of age or older with SARS-CoV2 virus infection, and patients with suspected infection at beginning of admission but with negative PCR, were studied with CTPA for suspicion of VTE, during their hospitalization. Results During the study period, 52 CTPA were performed in our hospital, sixteen in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. No significant differences in age (p=0.43) and sex (p=0.31) were found between the two groups, infected and non-infected patients. In the infected group, the patients who had PE had a much lower median age (47.8 years) than those without PE (73.3 years). No differences between infected and non-infected patients were detected in the diagnosis of PE with CTPA, 28.6% versus 27.8% (p=1.00). Overall patient mortality was 1.9%; one patient died (6.3%) in the infected group, and none in the non-infected group (p=0.31).

87,Mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the CLINIMEX exercise cohort in the year of 2020,"Background and Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily hit Brazil and, in particular, our Clinic's current location in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro city, where, as of mid-February 2021, resulting in one 1 death per 266 inhabitants. After having recently updated the vital status and mortality data in our exercise population (CLINIMEX cohort), we hypothesized that reviewing their evaluation reports would offer a unique opportunity to unearth some relevant information about the association between selected variables assessed in our comprehensive Exercise Medicine evaluation protocol; in particular, aerobic and musculoskeletal (MUSK) fitness, clinical variables, and death due to COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective study using data from the CLINIMEX cohort that included 6,101 non-athletic men and women aged >30 years who were alive as of March 12th, 2020 and who's vital status was followed up to December 14th, 2020. For data analysis, two approaches were used: 1) comparison of frequency of deaths and relative % of underlying causes of death between the last 18-months pre-pandemic and 9-month pandemic periods; and 2) data from 51 variables from the participant's most recent evaluation, including sex, age and clinical profile plus other variables obtained from physical examination, spirometry, (MUSK) fitness (e.g., sitting-rising test) and maximal cycling leg cardiopulmonary testing (e.g. maximal VO2 and cardiorespiratory optimal point) were selected for comparison between groups of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths. Results: Age at death varied from 51 to 102 years [mean = 80 years]. Only 4 participants that died, 3 COVID-19 and 1 non-COVID-19, were healthy at the time of their evaluation [p=.52]. COVID-19 was the most frequent (n=35; 36.5%) cause among the 96 deaths during this 9-month period. Comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, there was a 35% increase in deaths and proportionately fewer deaths due to neoplasia and other causes but not from cardiovascular or endocrine diseases. Results of aerobic and MUSK fitness tests indicated that the majority of the study participants were relatively unfit when compared to available age and sex-reference values. Indeed, there were few differences in the 51 selected variables between the two groups, suggesting a somewhat healthier profile among COVID-19 death participants; lower body mass index [p=.04], higher % of predicted forced vital capacity [p=.04], lower number of previous percutaneous coronary interventions [p=.04] and lower resting supine diastolic blood pressure [p=.03], with no differences for aerobic/MUSK fitness variables or past history of exercise/sports [p>.05]. Conclusion: Our data support that COVID-19 was a frequent and premature cause of death in a convenience sample of primarily white, unhealthy, middle-age and elderly individuals and that data from exercise/sport history and physical fitness testing obtained some years earlier were unable to distinguish non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths.",Claudio Gil S Araujo; Christina G De Souza e Silva; Claudia Lucia B Castro; Jari A Laukkanen; Jonathan Myers; Josef Niebauer; Aline Sardinha; Joao Felipe Franca,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253138,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253138,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True

Neurological symptoms are part of its clinical spectrum. Objective: To know the neurological manifestations in patients infected by COVID-19 in Argentina. Methods: Multicenter study conducted in adults, from May 2020 to January 2021, with confirmed COVID-19 and neurological symptoms. Demographic variables, existence of systemic or neurological comorbidities, the form of onset of the infection, alteration in complementary studies and the degree of severity of neurological symptoms were recorded. Results: 817 patients from all over the country were included, 52% male, mean age 38 years, most of them without comorbidities or previous neurological pathology. The first symptom of the infection was neurological in 56.2% of the cases, predominantly headache (69%), then anosmia / ageusia (66%). Myalgias (52%), allodynia / hyperalgesia (18%), and asthenia (6%) were also reported. 3.2% showed diffuse CNS involvement such as encephalopathy or seizures. 1.7% had cerebrovascular complications. Sleep disorders were observed in 3.2%. 6 patients were reported with Guillain Barre (GBS), peripheral neuropathy (3.4%), tongue paresthesia (0.6%), hearing loss (0.4%), plexopathy (0.3%). The severity of neurological symptoms was correlated with age and the existence of comorbidities.

90,"The tumor burden of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at initial diagnosis, pre- versus post-Covid-19 lockdown","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in the provision of screening, case identification and hospital referrals to cancer patients. To our knowledge, no study has yet correlated quantitatively the consequences of these limitations for cancer patient management. This study evaluates the implications of such reductions for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in both the pre- and post-lockdown periods. Methods: We examined 80 newly identified mCRC patients from 18 different clinical centers. These cases come from the screening procedure of a clinical trial which is using circulating DNA (cirDNA) analysis to determine their RAS and BRAF status. Results: The tumor burden as evaluated by the median total plasma cirDNA concentration showed a statistically higher level in patients diagnosed post-lockdown compared to those diagnosed pre-lockdown (119.2 versus 17.3 ng/mL; p<0.0001). In order to link tumor burden to survival, we compared the survival of these mCRC patients with previous studies in which cirDNA was examined in the same way (median survival, 16.2 months; median follow up, 48.7 months, N=135). Given the poor survival rate of mCRC patients with high cirDNA levels (14.7 vs 20.0 and 8.8 vs 19.3 months median survival when dichotomizing the cohort by the median cirDNA concentration 24.4 and 100 ng/mL, respectively), our study points to the potential deleterious consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

91,Prediction of COVID-19 Mortality to Support Patient Prognosis and Triage and Limits of Current Open-Source Data,"This study examines the accuracy and applicability of machine learning methods in early prediction of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patient symptoms, pre-existing conditions, age and sex were employed as predictive attributes from data spanning 17 countries. Performance on a semi-evenly balanced class sample of 212 patients resulted in high detection accuracy of 92.5%, with strong specificity and sensitivity. Performance on a larger sample of 5,121 patients with only age and mortality information was added as a measure of baseline discriminatory ability. Stratifying - Random Forest - and linear - Logistic Regression - methods were applied, both achieving modestly strong performance, with 77.4%-79.3% sensitivity and 71.4%-72.6% accuracy, highlighting predictive power even on the basis of a single attribute. Mutual information was employed as a dimensionality reduction technique, either greatly improving performance or having negligible impact, showing how a small number of easily retrievable attributes can provide timely and accurate predictions, with applications for datasets with slowly available attributes - such as laboratory results. Limitations of the data were extensively explored and detailed, as each results section outlines a further investigation exploring a facet of its flaws. Future use of this dataset should be cautious and always accompanied by disclaimers on issues of real-life reproducibility. While its open-source nature is a credit to the wider research community and more such datasets should be published, in its current state it is imperfect for most statistical patient-level studies and can produce valid conclusions only for a limited set of applications.",Riccardo Doyle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253984,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253984,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
92,Development of a COVID-19 Application Ontology for the ACT Network,"Clinical data networks that leverage large volumes of data in electronic health records (EHRs) are significant resources for research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data harmonization is a key challenge in seamless use of multisite EHRs for COVID-19 research. We developed a COVID-19 application ontology in the national Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network that enables harmonization of data elements that that are critical to COVID-19 research. The ontology contains over 50,000 concepts in the domains of diagnosis, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. In particular, it has computational phenotypes to characterize the course of illness and outcomes, derived terms, and harmonized value sets for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests. The ontology was deployed and validated on the ACT COVID-19 network that consists of nine academic health centers with data on 14.5M patients.

93,Impact of Clinical and Genomic Factors on SARS-CoV2 Disease Severity,"The SARS-CoV2 virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic is manifesting itself in different ways among infected people. While many are experiencing mild flue-like symptoms or are even remaining asymptomatic after infection, the virus has also led to serious complications, overloading ICUs while claiming more than 2.6 million lives world-wide. In this work, we apply AI methods to better understand factors that drive the severity of the disease. From the UK BioBank dataset we analyzed both clinical and genomic data of patients infected by this virus. Leveraging positiveunlabeled machine learning algorithms coupled with RubricOE, a state-of-the-art genomic analysis framework forgenomic feature extraction, we propose severity prediction algorithms with high F1 score.

94,Axes of Prognosis: Identifying Subtypes of COVID-19 Outcomes,"COVID-19 is a disease with vast impact, yet much remains unclear about patient outcomes. Most approaches to risk prediction of COVID-19 focus on binary or tertiary severity outcomes, despite the heterogeneity of the disease. In this work, we identify heterogeneous subtypes of COVID-19 outcomes by considering 'axes' of prognosis. We propose two innovative clustering approaches - 'Layered Axes' and 'Prognosis Space' - to apply on patients' outcome data. We then show how these clusters can help predict a patient's deterioration pathway on their hospital admission, using random forest classification. We illustrate this methodology on a cohort from Wuhan in early 2020. We discover interesting subgroups of poor prognosis, particularly within respiratory patients, and predict respiratory subgroup membership with high accuracy. This work could assist clinicians in identifying appropriate treatments at patients' hospital admission. Moreover, our method could be used to explore subtypes of 'long COVID' and other diseases with heterogeneous outcomes.",Emma Whitfield; Claire Coffey; Huayu Zhang; Ting Shi; Xiaodong Wu; Qiang Li; Honghan Wu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253371,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253371,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
95,Evaluation of albumin kinetics in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 compared to those with sepsis-induced ARDS,"COVID-19 outcomes like mortality have been associated with albumin alteration. However, it is unclear whether albumin changes in COVID-19 are pathogen specific or not. To this end, we characterized the kinetics of serum albumin in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 compared to mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis-induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). We discovered two phases of alterations in albumin levels during the course of Covid-19 critical illness, but not for the sepsis-induced ARDS.

96,First and second SARS-CoV-2 waves in inner London: A comparison of admission characteristics and the effects of the B.1.1.7 variant,"Introduction: A second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection spread across the UK in 2020 linked with emergence of the more transmissible B.1.1.7 variant. The emergence of new variants, particularly during relaxation of social distancing policies and implementation of mass vaccination, highlights the need for real-time integration of detailed patient clinical data alongside pathogen genomic data. We linked clinical data with viral genome sequence data to compare patients admitted during the first and second waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Clinical, laboratory and demographic data from five electronic health record (EHR) systems was collected for all cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test between March 13th 2020 and February 17th 2021. SARS-CoV-2 viral sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technology. Descriptive data are presented comparing cases between waves, and between cases of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 variants. Results: There were 5810 SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases comprising inpatients (n=2341), healthcare workers (n=1549), outpatients (n=874), emergency department (ED) attenders not subsequently admitted (n=532), inter-hospital transfers (n=281) and nosocomial cases (n=233). There were two dominant waves of admissions starting from around March 13th and October 20th, both with a temporally aligned rise in nosocomial cases (n=96 in wave one, n=137 in wave two). 1470 SARS-CoV-2 isolates were successfully sequenced, including 216/838 (26%) admitted cases from wave one, 472/1503 (31%) admitted cases in wave two and 121/233 (52%) nosocomial cases. 400/472 (85%) of sequenced isolates from admitted cases in wave two were the B.1.1.7 variant. The first B.1.1.7 variant was identified on 15th November 2020 and increased rapidly to comprise almost all sequenced isolates in January 2021 (n=600/617, 97%). Females made up a larger proportion of admitted cases in wave two (47.2% vs 41.8%, p=0.012), and in those infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared to non-B.1.1.7 variants (48.0% vs 41.8%, p=0.042). A diagnosis of frailty was less common in wave two (11.5% v 22.8%, p<0.001) and in the group infected with B.1.1.7 (14.5% v 22.4%, p=0.001). There was no difference in severity on admission between waves, as measured by hypoxia at admission (wave one: 64.3% vs wave two: 65.6%, p=0.658). However, a higher proportion of cases infected with the B.1.1.7 variant were hypoxic on admission compared to other variants (70.0% vs 62.5%, p=0.029). Conclusions: Automated EHR data extraction linked with SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data provides valuable insight into the evolving characteristics of cases admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The proportion of cases with hypoxia on admission was greater in those infected with the B.1.1.7 variant, which supports evidence the B.1.1.7 variant is associated with more severe disease. The number of nosocomial cases was similar in both waves despite introduction of many infection control interventions before wave two, an observation requiring further investigation.",Luke B Snell; Wenjuan Wang; Adela Alcolea-Medina; Themoula Charalampous; Gaia Nebbia; Rahul Batra; Leonardo de Jongh; Finola Higgins; Yanzhong Wang; Jonathan D Edgeworth; Vasa Curcin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253377,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253377,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
97,Mortality and Severity in COVID-19 Patients on ACEIs & ARBs - A Meta-Regression Analysis,"Purpose: The primary objective of this review is to examine studies reporting association of mortality in COVID-19 patients with whether they were on Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). A secondary objective is to similarly access associations with higher severity of the disease in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: We searched multiple COVID-19 databases (WHO, CDC, LIT-COVID) for randomized trials and longitudinal studies from all over the world reporting mortality and severity published before January 18th, 2021. Meta-analyses were performed using 53 studies for mortality outcome and 43 for the severity outcome. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were generated to describe overall effect size using random effect models. To account for between study results variations, multivariate meta-Regression was performed with preselected covariates using maximum likelihood method for both the mortality and severity models. Result: Our findings showed that the use of ACEIs/ARBs did not significantly influence either mortality (OR=1.16 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44, p= 0.15, I2 = 93.2%) or severity (OR=1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.48 p= 0.15, I2 = 91.1%) in comparison to not being on ACEIs/ARBs in COVID-19 positive patients. Multivariate meta-regression for the mortality model demonstrated that 36% of between study variations could be explained by differences in age, gender, and proportion of heart diseases in the study samples. Multivariate meta-regression for the severity model demonstrated that 8% of between study variations could be explained by differences in age, proportion of diabetes, heart disease and study country in the study samples. Conclusion: We found no association of mortality or severity in COVID-19 patients taking ACEIs/ARBs.",Romil Singh; Sawai Singh Rathore; Hira Khan; Abhishek Bhurwal; Mack Sheraton; Prithwish Ghosh; Sohini Anand; Janaki Makadia; FNU Ayesha; Kiran Mahapure; Ishita Mehra; Aysun Tekin; Rahul Kashyap; Vikas Bansal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253557,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253557,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
98,"Broad decline and subsequent differential re-emergence of respiratory viruses during COVID-19 pandemic response measures, Singapore 2020","Importance. COVID-19 pandemic control measures affect the prevalence of other respiratory viruses. Effects on some viruses have been described; however, the broader impact and temporal relationship of control measures on virus decline and subsequent re-emergence have not been thoroughly documented. Understanding these phenomena may influence health policies. Objective. To examine the prevalence of unrelated respiratory viruses in relation to population-wide pandemic response measures and phases in 2020 in Singapore. Design, Setting, and Participants. Data from respiratory multiplex PCRs from 3 major hospitals (total 3700 beds) in Singapore were collated. The full dataset consisted of 42,558 test results, 19,898 from 2019 and 22,660 from 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures. Weekly virus prevalence data were mapped onto prevailing pandemic response measures, in order to elucidate temporal relationships and differential virus responses. Pre-pandemic data from 2019 were compared with data from 2020. Results. Early response measures, even before national lockdown, were followed by a dramatic reduction of influenza viruses and a more gradual decline of other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, endemic coronaviruses and metapneumovirus. Marked decline of enterovirus/rhinovirus and adenovirus, however, was only observed during lockdown. About 13 weeks into phased reopening, enterovirus/rhinovirus re-emerged, followed by adenovirus, the latter mainly in the pediatric population. All other viruses remained at low levels until the end of 2020. Conclusions and Relevance. COVID-19 control measures in Singapore had a significant impact on a broad range of respiratory viruses. Effects of various control measures varied between phases and different viruses. Influenza viruses declined earliest and most dramatically; relaxation of measures was followed by re-emergence of enterovirus/rhinovirus and adenovirus. These patterns are presumably a result of different propensities for contact versus droplet and overall ease of transmission, and different virus reservoirs.

99,Accelerated RNA detection using tandem CRISPR nucleases,"Direct, amplification-free detection of RNA has the potential to transform molecular diagnostics by enabling simple on-site analysis of human or environmental samples. CRISPR-Cas nucleases offer programmable RNA-guided recognition of RNA that triggers cleavage and release of a fluorescent reporter molecule1,2, but long reaction times hamper sensitivity and speed when applied to point-of-care testing. Here we show that unrelated CRISPR nucleases can be deployed in tandem to provide both direct RNA sensing and rapid signal generation, thus enabling robust detection of ~30 RNA copies/microliter in 20 minutes. Combining RNA-guided Cas13 and Csm6 with a chemically stabilized activator creates a one-step assay that detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal samples with PCR-derived Ct values up to 29 in microfluidic chips, using a compact imaging system. This Fast Integrated Nuclease Detection In Tandem (FIND-IT) approach enables direct RNA detection in a format amenable to point-of-care infection diagnosis, as well as to a wide range of other diagnostic or research applications.",Tina Y.

100,Comparison between one and two dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prioritisation for a fixed number of vaccine doses,"Background: The swift development of vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2, which have been shown to generate significant immune responses and offer considerable protection against disease, has been met with worldwide commendation. However, in the context of an ongoing pandemic there is an interplay between infection and vaccination. While infection can grow exponentially, potentially overwhelming healthcare resources, vaccination rates are generally limited by both supply and logistics. With the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines receiving medical approval requiring two doses, there has been scrutiny on the spacing between doses; an elongated period between doses would allow more of the population to receive a first vaccine dose in the short-term generating wide-spread partial immunity. Methods: Focusing on data from England, we investigated prioritisation of a one dose or two dose vaccination schedule given a fixed number of vaccine doses and with respect to a measure of maximising averted deaths. We optimised outcomes for two different estimates of population size and relative risk of mortality for at-risk groups within the Phase 1 vaccine priority order in England, for different amounts of available vaccine and for different vaccine efficacies. Findings: We find that vaccines offering relatively high protection from the first dose (compared to the efficacy derived from two doses) favour strategies that prioritise giving more people one dose rather than a smaller number two. The optimal mix of one and two doses between the defined priority groups of Phase 1 shows a pattern of returning to give second doses to the highest risk groups as the number of available doses increases. Discussion: While this work highlights that an optimal timing of first and second doses between the Phase 1 priority groups can substantially reduce the overall mortality risk to the population, there also needs to be careful consideration of the precise timing between first and second doses as well as the logistics of vaccine delivery.",Edward M Hill; Matt J Keeling,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253542,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253542,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,,True
101,Some Clinical and Immunological Features of Imported COVID-19 Cases in Mongolia,"SARS-CoV-2 disturbs the normal immune responses causing an uncontrolled inflammatory response in patients with severe COVID-19. The pattern of the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 in individuals may fluctuate. Some have a virus-dependent protective immune response resulting in asymptomatic or mild disease with elimination of the virus within 7-10 days after onset of infection. Others develop virus non-dependent uncontrolled hyper-inflammation in the later period, leading to severe disease with cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure. Methods: The serum of 72 patients was investigated for titers of 15 cytokines and chemokines using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in the serum of peripheral blood samples. The means of groups were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple post hoc comparisons if the ANOVA p-value was <0.05. Results: Patients with pulmonary infiltrates on CT demonstrated a lower percentage of eosinophils (1.38{+/-}1.46%) and elevated level of serum CRP (8.57{+/-}19.10 mg/dL) compared to patients without pulmonary infiltrates (2.52{+/-}1.47% and 1.96{+/-}3.02 mg/dL respectively; p<0.05).

103,"Addressing disruptions in childhood routine immunisation services during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives and lessons learned from Liberia, Nepal, and Senegal","The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted multifaceted disruptions to routine immunisation from global to local levels, affecting every aspect of vaccine supply, access, and demand. Since March 2020, country programmes have implemented a range of strategies to either continue vaccination services during COVID-19 measures like  lockdown and/or resume services when risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be appropriately mitigated. Through the Exemplars in Global Health partnership in Liberia, Nepal, and Senegal, we conducted interviews with immunisation programme managers and ministry of health leadership to better understand how they have addressed the myriad vaccination challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. From establishing alternative modes of service delivery to combatting vaccine distrust and rumours via risk communication campaigns, many routine immunisation programmes have demonstrated how to adapt, resume, and/or maintain vital vaccination efforts during the COVID-19 crisis. Yet millions of children remain un- or under-vaccinated worldwide, and the same programmes striving to implement catch-up services for missed doses and postponed mass campaigns will also soon be tasked with COVID-19 vaccine deployment. As laid bare by the current pandemic, the worlds gains against vaccine-preventable diseases are fragile: enshrined by a delicate global ecosystem of logistics, supply, and procurement, the success of routine immunisation ultimately rests upon dedicated programme staff, the resources and support available to them, and then the trust in and demand for vaccines by their recipients. Our collective lessons learned during COVID-19 offer insights in programme adaptation and resilience that, if prioritised, could strengthen equitable, sustainable vaccine delivery for all populations.

Summary boxO_LIKey message 1: As the COVID-19 pandemic affected routine immunisation services worldwide, country programmes have used a range of mitigation strategies to maintain vaccine delivery and/or resume interrupted programming. Interviews with immunisation programme managers and Ministry of Health staff provided key perspectives and lessons learned on how countries have approached routine immunisation services during the COVID-19 crisis.
C_LIO_LIKey message 2: Key themes for mitigating COVID-19s effects on routine immunisation included prioritising continued services with strengthened infection prevention control; identifying alternative locations and approaches to providing vaccine services (e.g., conducting door-to-door vaccination if facility-based services were not possible); engaging in effective communications and mobilisation activities, especially to offset misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines; setting up systems and strategies for reaching children who missed doses amid periods of disruption; and conducting catch-up campaigns as soon as SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks could be minimised.
C_LIO_LIKey message 3: The ways in which COVID-19 has affected routine immunisation services have varied over time and across settings, underscoring the importance of contextually-tailored mitigation efforts and adaptation given evolving challenges amid an ongoing pandemic. As countries prepare and initiate roll-out COVID-19 vaccines, it will be vital to avoid one-size-fits-all implementation strategies and support the continuance of routine immunisation services through this next phase of COVID-19 response.

104,Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake in an elderly sample in Poland,"BackgroundsThis research represents an investigation into potential predictors for the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination in Poland, following the instigation of policies to encourage the over-seventies to be vaccinated.

MethodsIndividuals participated in cross-sectional structured interviews. 1427 respondents were questioned for determining vaccination uptake, revealing attitudes regarding vaccination, where information was sourced from, health status and behavior, demographics and socio-economic profiles.

ResultsSelected predictors for acceptance of the vaccination were: being talked through the importance of the vaccination and potential side-effects by a medical professional; sharing living space with others; having a high ranking occupation; suffering from chronic illnesses; being able to access medical services by driving or walking rather than using public transport or relying on others. Those who opted not to be vaccinated most frequently justify their decision by saying that they were concerned about the efficacy of the vaccine or that they were worried about side-effects.

ConclusionsIt appears that the current nationwide campaign has successfully raised awareness regarding the vaccine, but this research indicates that a more information-based campaign, focusing on evidence of the vaccines efficacy and the non-serious nature of all side-effects, could lead to improved uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.",Marta Malesza; Magdalena Bozym,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254047,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254047,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True

Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was carried out. The review methods were informed by the Joana Briggs Institute guideline for systematic reviews.

ResultsThe review included 22 studies from nine countries, with participants totalling 239,830. The included studies quality was moderate to high. The identified determinants were categorised into demographic, biological, socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors, based on the Dahlgren and Whitehead determinant of health model. Increasing age (ORs 1.04-20.6, 95%CIs 1.01-22.68) was the common demographic determinant of COVID-19 mortality while living with diabetes (ORs 0.50-3.2, 95%CIs -0.2-0.74) was one of the most common biological determinants of COVID-19 length of hospitalisation.

Review limitationMeta-analysis was not conducted because of included studies heterogeneity.

ConclusionCOVID-19 outcomes are predicted by multiple determinants, with increasing age and living with diabetes being the most common risk factors. Population-level policies that prioritise interventions for the elderly population and the people living with diabetes may help mitigate the outbreaks impact.

106,Corticosteroids and mortality in patients with severe Covid-19 who have autoantibodies,"Auto-reactivity in COVID-19 is increasingly being recognized and may identify a group of patients with inflammation severe enough to result in loss of self-tolerance. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents and now the standard of care for patients with severe Covid-19 requiring oxygen support/mechanical ventilation. We studied the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who demonstrated clinically identifiable auto-reactivity and received corticosteroid treatment.

In this retrospective cohort study, we included 51 COVID-19 patients admitted between March 10, 2020 and May 2, 2020 who received corticosteroid treatment and also had serum sample in our institution bio-bank available for ANA and RF ELISA. Twelve patients (23.5%) had positive ANA or RF. Mortality rate among patients with positive autoantibodies was significantly higher than those without (9/12 or 75% versus 13/39 or 33.3%, p= 0.02). The high mortality rate in patients with auto-reactivity warrants further investigation and may be the subgroup where additional immunomodulation is effective.",Zhu Cui; Maxwell Roth; Yelena Averbukh; Andrei Assa; Azal Al-ani; William Southern; Morayma Reyes Gill; Shitij Arora,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253005,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253005,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
107,In-person schooling and COVID-19 transmission in Canada's three largest cities,"In North America and Europe, the Fall 2020 school term has coincided with the beginning of the second wave of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, sparking a heated debate about the role of in-person schooling for community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This issue has immediate policy relevance for deciding how to operate schools safely as the pandemic unfolds, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating, and immunization coverage remains low. We contribute to this debate by presenting data on trends in COVID-19 weekly incidence among school-aged children 0-19 years old vis-a-vis other age groups during Fall 2020 in Canadas three largest cities: Montreal, Toronto and Calgary. We interpret these trends in light of the different back-to-school policies and other public health measures implemented in the three cities over the observation period.

KEY POINTSO_LISchool closures are an effective measure to reduce the overall incidence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Nonetheless, there is a general consensus that the decision to close schools to control the spread of COVID-19 should be used as last resort because of the negative impact on childrens development and mental health, and since they are less likely to have severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults.
C_LIO_LIExisting evidence highlights the importance of adopting appropriate mitigation strategies for limiting COVID-19 community spread when returning to in-person schooling. To understand the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19 transmission given different mitigation strategies, especially universal masking and distance learning, we compare how the second wave of COVID-19 has affected school-aged children age 0-19 years old vis-a-vis other age groups in Montreal, Toronto and Calgary during Fall 2020.
C_LIO_LIThe case of Montreal attests to the negative consequences of not implementing recommended migration strategies when reopening schools, even when public health measures such as gatherings restrictions are in place to maintain low levels of community transmission. On the contrary, school measures adopted in Toronto (optional distance learning and masking mandates), have limited the role of COVID-19 transmission among school-aged children for overall community transmission. In Calgary, this effect has been smaller, likely because public health measures to limit COVID-19 community spread were not introduced until early December 2020.
C_LIO_LIOur findings have immediate policy relevance for deciding how to operate schools safely as the pandemic unfolds, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating, and immunization coverage remains low.

108,"Long Covid in adults discharged from UK hospitals after Covid-19: A prospective, multicentre cohort study using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol.","Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSThe long-term consequences of severe Covid-19 requiring hospital admission are not well characterised. The objective of this study was to establish the long-term effects of Covid-19 following hospitalisation and the impact these may have on patient reported outcome measures.

DesignA multicentre, prospective cohort study with at least 3 months follow-up of participants admitted to hospital between 5th February 2020 and 5th October 2020.

Setting31 hospitals in the United Kingdom.

Participants327 hospitalised participants discharged alive from hospital with confirmed/high likelihood SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main outcome measures and comparisonsThe primary outcome was self-reported recovery at least ninety days after initial Covid-19 symptom onset. Secondary outcomes included new symptoms, new or increased disability (Washington group short scale), breathlessness (MRC Dyspnoea scale) and quality of life (EQ5D-5L). We compared these outcome measures across age, comorbidity status and in-hospital Covid-19 severity to identify groups at highest risk of developing long-term difficulties. Multilevel logistic and linear regression models were built to adjust for the effects of patient and centre level risk factors on these outcomes.

ResultsIn total 53.7% (443/824) contacted participants responded, yielding 73.8% (327/443) responses with follow-up of 90 days or more from symptom onset. The median time between symptom onset of initial illness and completing the participant questionnaire was 222 days (Interquartile range (IQR) 189 to 269 days). In total, 54.7% (179/327) of participants reported they did not feel fully recovered. Persistent symptoms were reported by 93.3% (305/325) of participants, with fatigue the most common (82.8%, 255/308), followed by breathlessness (53.5%, 175/327). 46.8% (153/327) reported an increase in MRC dyspnoea scale of at least one grade. New or worse disability was reported by 24.2% (79/327) of participants. Overall (EQ5D-5L) summary index was significantly worse at the time of follow-up (median difference 0.1 points on a scale of 0 to 1, IQR: -0.2 to 0.0). Females under the age of 50 years were five times less likely to report feeling recovered (adjusted OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.64 to 15.74), were more likely to have greater disability (adjusted OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.94), twice as likely to report worse fatigue (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31) and seven times more likely to become more breathless (adjusted OR 7.15, 95% CI 2.24 to 22.83) than men of the same age.

ConclusionsSurvivors of Covid-19 experienced long-term symptoms, new disability, increased breathlessness, and reduced quality of life. These findings were present even in young, previously healthy working age adults, and were most common in younger females. Policymakers should fund further research to identify effective treatments for long-Covid and ensure healthcare, social care and welfare support is available for individuals with long-Covid.

109,Detection of Mutations Associated with Variants of Concern Via High Throughput Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Isolated from NYC Wastewater,"Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is strongly indicated because diversifying selection may lead to the emergence of novel variants resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity. To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community. Here we describe a safe, affordable protocol for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. Our targeted sequencing approach revealed the presence of mutations associated with several Variants of Concern at appreciable frequencies. Our work demonstrates that wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing can inform surveillance efforts monitoring the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and detect the appearance of novel emerging variants more cheaply, safely, and efficiently than the sequencing of individual clinical samples.

IMPORTANCEThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused millions of deaths around the world as countries struggle to contain infections. The pandemic will not end until herd immunity is reached, that is, when most of the population has either recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern threatens to erase gains. Emerging new variants may re-infect persons who have recovered from COVID-19 or may evade vaccine-induced immunity. However, scaling up SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing to monitor Variants of Concern in communities around the world is challenging. Wastewater-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be used to monitor the presence of emerging variants in large communities to enact control measures to minimize the spread of these variants. We describe here the identification of alleles associated with several variants of concern in wastewater obtained from NYC watersheds.",Davida S Smyth; Monica Trujillo; Kristen Cheung; Anna Gao; Irene Hoxie; Sherin Kannoly; Nanami Kubota; Michelle Markman; Kaungmyat San; Geena Sompanya; John J Dennehy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253978,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21253978,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,True
110,Age-related changes in the upper respiratory microbiome are associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and illness severity,"Children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and typically have milder illness courses than adults. We studied the nasopharyngeal microbiomes of 274 children, adolescents, and young adults with SARS-CoV-2 exposure using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We find that higher abundances of Corynebacterium species are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory symptoms, while higher abundances of Dolosigranulum pigrum are present in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals without respiratory symptoms. We also demonstrate that the abundances of these bacteria are strongly, and independently, associated with age, suggesting that the nasopharyngeal microbiome may be a potentially modifiable mechanism by which age influences SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity.

SummaryEvaluation of nasopharyngeal microbiome profiles in children, adolescents, and young adults with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact identified specific bacterial species that vary in abundance with age and are associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the presence of SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory symptoms.",Jillian H.

111,Antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs reduce viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 and fluoxetine show antiviral activity against the novel variants in vitro,"Background and PurposeRepurposing of currently available drugs is a valuable strategy to tackle the consequences of COVID-19. Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants.

Experimental ApproachSeveral antidepressant drugs and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351.

Key ResultsSeveral clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudo viruses with N501Y, K417N, and E484K spike mutations, and the VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2.

112,The Prolyl-tRNA Synthetase Inhibitor Halofuginone Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Summary ParagraphWe identify the prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) inhibitor halofuginone1, a compound in clinical trials for anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory applications2, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) promotes viral entry3. We find that halofuginone reduces HS biosynthesis, thereby reducing spike protein binding, SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Halofuginone also potently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication post-entry and is 1,000-fold more potent than Remdesivir4. Inhibition of HS biosynthesis and SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on specific inhibition of PRS, possibly due to translational suppression of proline-rich proteins. We find that pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several HS proteoglycans, are proline-rich, which may make them particularly vulnerable to halofuginones translational suppression. Halofuginone is orally bioavailable, has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in humans and distributes to SARS-CoV-2 target organs, including the lung, making it a near-term clinical trial candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.",Daniel R.

114,Protein-primed RNA synthesis in SARS-CoVs and structural basis for inhibition by AT-527,"How viruses from the Coronaviridae family initiate viral RNA synthesis is unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain on nsp12 uridylates the viral cofactor nsp8, forming a UMP-Nsp8 covalent intermediate that subsequently primes RNA synthesis from a poly(A) template; a protein-priming mechanism reminiscent of Picornaviridae enzymes. In parallel, the RdRp active site of nsp12 synthesizes a pppGpU primer, which primes (-)ssRNA synthesis at the precise genome-poly(A) junction. The guanosine analogue 5-triphosphate AT-9010 (prodrug: AT-527) tightly binds to the NiRAN and inhibits both nsp8-labeling and the initiation of RNA synthesis. A 2.98 [A] resolution Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8)2 /RNA/NTP quaternary complex shows AT-9010 simultaneously binds to both NiRAN and RdRp active site of nsp12, blocking their respective activities.

115,The Dual-Antigen Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine Delivered as an Intranasal Plus Subcutaneous Prime Elicits Th1 Dominant T-Cell and Humoral Responses in CD-1 Mice,"In response to the need for an efficacious, thermally-stable COVID-19 vaccine that can elicit both humoral and cell-mediated T-cell responses, we have developed a dual-antigen human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) COVID-19 vaccine in formulations suitable for subcutaneous (SC), intranasal (IN), or oral delivery. The vaccine expresses both the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins using an hAd5 platform with E1, E2b, and E3 sequences deleted (hAd5[E1-, E2b-, E3-]) that is effective even in the presence of hAd5 immunity. In the vaccine, S is modified (S-Fusion) for enhanced cell-surface display to elicit humoral responses and N is modified with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) to direct N to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway to increase MHC I and II presentation. Initial studies using subcutaneous (SC) prime and SC boost vaccination of CD-1 mice demonstrated that the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine elicits T-helper cell 1 (Th1) dominant T-cell and humoral responses to both S and N. We then compared SC to IN prime vaccination with either an SC or IN boost post-SC prime and an IN boost after IN prime. These studies reveal that IN prime/IN boost is as effective at generating Th1 dominant humoral responses to both S and N as the other combinations, but that the SC prime with either an IN or SC boost elicits greater T cell responses. In a third study to assess the power of the two routes of delivery when used together, we used a combined SC plus IN prime with or without a boost and found the combined prime alone to be as effective as the combined prime with either an SC or IN boost in generating both humoral and T-cell responses. The findings here in CD-1 mice demonstrate that combined SC and IN prime-only delivery has the potential to provide broad immunity - including mucosal immunity - against SARS-CoV-2 and supports further testing of this delivery approach in additional animal models and clinical trials.",Adrian Rice; Mohit Verma; Annie Shin; Lise Zakin; Peter Sieling; Shiho Tanaka; Joseph Balint; Kyle Dinkins; Helty Adisetiyo; Brett Morimoto; Justin Taft; Roosheel Sandeep Patel; Sofija Buta; Marta Martin-Fernandez; Dusan Bogunovic; Patricia R Spilman; Elizabeth R Gabitzsch; Jeffrey T Safrit; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Kayvan Niazi; Patrick Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436476,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436476,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
116,Characterization and functional interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a devastating global health crisis. The emergence of highly transmissible novel viral strains that escape neutralizing responses emphasizes the urgent need to deepen our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and to develop additional therapeutic strategies. Using a comprehensive identification of RNA binding proteins (RBP) by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-M/S) approach, we identified 142 high-confidence cellular factors that bind the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome during infection. By systematically knocking down their expression in a human lung epithelial cell line, we found that the majority of the RBPs identified in our study are proviral factors that regulate SARS-CoV-2 genome replication. We showed that some of these proteins represented drug targets of interest for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this study we explore whether the virus in the dry swab is viable and can be cultured and propagated.

MethodSwabs were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 and stored in three different conditions: a) as dry swab (SD, eluted in 1 mL DMEM), b) in 1 mL of Viral Transport Medium (SVTM), and c) in 1 mL of Tris-EDTA buffer (STE). The sample groups were stored either at room temperature (RT, 25{degrees}C{+/-}1{degrees}C) or at 4{degrees}C for 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours before being used as viral inoculums for the propagation studies in Vero cells.

ResultsThe RT-qPCR data suggests that SD incubated both at RT and 4{degrees}C harbors viral particles that are viable and culturable at par with SVTM and STE.

To deliver a potentially immediate and lasting treatment to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, new collaborations and ways of sharing are required to create as many paths forward as possible. Here we leverage our expertise in computational antibody engineering to rationally design/optimize three previously reported SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and share our proposal towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 biologics therapeutics. SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, m396, 80R, and CR-3022 were chosen as templates due to their diversified epitopes and confirmed neutralization potency against SARS. Structures of variable fragment (Fv) in complex with receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV2 were subjected to our established in silico antibody engineering platform to improve their binding affinity to SARS-CoV2 and developability profiles. The selected top mutations were ensembled into a focused library for each antibody for further screening. In addition, we convert the selected binders with different epitopes into the trispecific format, aiming to increase potency and to prevent mutational escape. Lastly, to avoid antibody induced virus activation or enhancement, we applied NNAS and DQ mutations to the Fc region to eliminate effector functions and extend half-life.",Saleh Riahi; Jae Hyeon Lee; Shuai Wei; Robert Cost; Alessandro Masiero; Catherine Prades; Reza Olfati-Saber; Maria Wendt; Anna Park; Yu Qiu; Yanfeng Zhou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436613,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436613,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
120,"Identification, crystallization and epitope determination of public TCR shared and expanded in COVID-19 patients","T cells play pivotal roles in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells mediate the production of antigen-specific antibodies; however, T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes used by SARS-CoV-2-specific Tfh cells have not been well characterized. Here, we first identified and crystallized public TCR of Tfh clonotypes that are shared and expanded in unhospitalized COVID-19-recovered patients. These clonotypes preferentially recognized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein epitopes which are conserved among emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. These clonotypes did not react with S proteins derived from common cold human coronaviruses, but cross-reacted with symbiotic bacteria, which might confer the publicity. Among SARS-CoV-2 S epitopes, S864-882, presented by frequent HLA-DR alleles, could activate multiple public Tfh clonotypes in COVID-19-recovered patients. Furthermore, S864-882-loaded HLA tetramer preferentially bound to CD4+ T cells expressing CXCR5.

121,Clonal dissection of immunodominance and cross-reactivity of the CD4+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2,"The identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes is essential for the design of effective vaccines capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies and long-term immunity. Here we demonstrate in COVID-19 patients a robust CD4+ T cell response to naturally processed SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleoprotein, including effector, helper and memory T cells. By characterizing 2,943 Spike-reactive T cell clones, we found that 34% of the clones and 93% of the patients recognized a conserved immunodominant region encompassing residues S346-365 in the RBD and comprising three nested HLA-DR and HLA-DP restricted epitopes. By using pre- and post-COVID-19 samples and Spike proteins from alpha and beta coronaviruses, we provide in vivo evidence of cross-reactive T cell responses targeting multiple sites in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The possibility of leveraging immunodominant and cross-reactive T helper epitopes is instrumental for vaccination strategies that can be rapidly adapted to counteract emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Jun Siong Low; Daniela Vaqueirinho; Federico Mele; Mathilde Foglierini; Michela Perotti; David Jarrossay; Sandra Jovic; Tatiana Terrot; Alessandra Franzetti Pellanda; Maira Biggiogero; Christian Garzoni; Paolo Ferrari; Alessandro Ceschi; Antonio Lanzavecchia; Antonino Cassotta; Federica Sallusto,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436642,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.436642,2021-03-23,2021-03-23,,False
122,The SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex is a priority target for broad-spectrum pan-coronavirus drugs,"In the absence of effective treatment, COVID-19 is likely to remain a global disease burden. Compounding this threat is the near certainty that novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential will emerge in years to come. Pan-coronavirus drugs - agents active against both SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses - would address both threats. A strategy to develop such broad-spectrum inhibitors is to pharmacologically target binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are highly conserved in other known coronaviruses, the assumption being that any selective pressure to keep a site conserved across past viruses will apply to future ones. Here, we systematically mapped druggable binding pockets on the experimental structure of fifteen SARS-CoV-2 proteins and analyzed their variation across twenty-seven - and {beta}-coronaviruses and across thousands of SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients. We find that the two most conserved druggable sites are a pocket overlapping the RNA binding site of the helicase nsp13, and the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12, both components of the viral replication-transcription complex.

123,"COVID-19 Survivors' Reports of the Timing, Duration, and Health Impacts of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) Infection","IMPORTANCEPost-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) is a major public health concern. Studies suggest that 1 in 3 infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop PASC, including those without initial symptoms or with mild COVID-19 disease.1, 2

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the timing, duration, and health impacts of PASC reported by a large group of primarily non-hospitalized COVID-19 survivors.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSA survey of 5,163 COVID-19 survivors reporting symptoms for more than 21 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were recruited from Survivor Corps and other online COVID-19 survivor support groups.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESParticipants reported demographic information, as well as the timing, duration, health impacts, and other attributes of PASC. The temporal distribution of symptoms, including average time of onset and duration of symptoms were determined, as well as the perceived distress and impact on ability to work.

RESULTSOn average, participants reported 21.4 symptoms and the number of symptoms ranged from 1 to 93. The most common symptoms were fatigue (79.0%), headache (55.3%), shortness of breath (55.3%), difficulty concentrating (53.6%), cough (49.0%), changed sense of taste (44.9%), diarrhea (43.9%), and muscle or body aches (43.5%). The timing of symptom onset varied and was best described as happening in waves. The longest lasting symptoms on average for all participants (in days) were ""frequently changing"" symptoms (112.0), inability to exercise (106.5), fatigue (101.7), difficulty concentrating (101.1), memory problems (100.8), sadness (99.2), hormone imbalance (99.1), and shortness of breath (96.9). The symptoms that affected ability to work included the relapsing/remitting nature of illness (described by survivors as ""changing symptoms""), inability to concentrate, fatigue, and memory problems, among others. Symptoms causing the greatest level of distress (on scale of 1 ""none"" to 5 ""a great deal"") were extreme pressure at the base of the head (4.4), syncope (4.3), sharp or sudden chest pain (4.2), brain pressure (4.2), headache (4.2), persistent chest pain or pressure (4.1), and bone pain in extremities (4.1).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEPASC is an emerging public health priority characterized by a wide range of changing symptoms, which hinder survivors ability to work. PASC has not been fully characterized and the trajectory of symptoms and long-term outcomes are unknown. There is no treatment for PASC, and survivors report distress in addition to a host of ongoing symptoms. Capturing patient reports of symptoms through open-ended inquiry is a critical first step in accurately and comprehensively characterizing PASC to ensure that medical treatments and management strategies best meet the needs of individual patients and help mitigate health impacts of this new disease.",Natalie Lambert; - Survivor Corps; Sarah A El-Azab; Nathan S Ramrakhiani; Anthony Barisano; Lu Yu; Kaitlyn Taylor; Alvaro Esperanca; Charles A Downs; Heather L Abrahim; Melissa D Pinto; Rana Chakraborty; Jessica L Borelli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.21254026,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.21254026,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
124,Recurrence quantification analysis of heart rate variability is a COVID-safe alternative to gas analysis in the detection of metabolic thresholds,"The first aim of the study was to verify if in individuals with different physical fitness levels the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) time series could be an alternative to Gas Exchange (GE) analysis in the determination of metabolic thresholds. The second aim was to investigate the validity of the RQA method compared to the GE method in thresholds detection. The two metabolic thresholds were estimated in thirty young individuals during Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing on a cycle-ergometer and HR, VO2 and Workload were measured by the two different methods (RQA and GE methods). RM ANOVA was used to assess main effects of methods and methods-by-groups interaction effects for HR, VO2 and Workload at the aerobic (AerT) and the anaerobic (AnT) thresholds. Validity of the RQA at both thresholds was assessed for HR, VO2 and Workload by Ordinary Least Products (OLP) regression analysis, Typical Percentage Errors (TE), Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland Altman plots. No methods-by-groups interaction effects were detected for HR, VO2 and Workload at the AerT and the AnT. The OLP regression analysis showed that at both thresholds RQA and GE methods had very strong correlations (r >0.8) in all variables (HR, VO2 and Workload). Slope and intercept values always included the 1 and the 0, respectively. At the AerT the TE ranged from 4.02% to 10.47% (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent ([&ge;]0.85). At the AnT the TE ranged from 2.61% to 6.64% (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent ([&ge;]0.89). Our results suggest that the RQA of HRV time series is a COVID-safe approach for the determination of metabolic thresholds in individuals with different physical fitness levels, therefore, it can be used as a valid method for threshold detection alternative to gas analysis.",Giovanna Zimatore; MariaChiara Gallotta; Valerio Bonavolntà; Matteo Campanella; Marco De Spirito; Laura Guidetti; Carlo Baldari,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436405,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436405,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
125,The Impact of Early or Late Lockdowns on the Spread of COVID-19 in US Counties,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a highly transmissible infectious disease that has infected over 122 million individuals worldwide. To combat this pandemic, governments around the world have imposed lockdowns. However, the impact of these lockdowns on the rates of COVID-19 transmission in communities is not well known. Here, we used COVID-19 case counts from 3,000+ counties in the United States (US) to determine the relationship between lockdown as well as other county factors and the rate of COVID-19 spread in these communities.

MethodsWe merged county-specific COVID-19 case counts with US census data and the date of lockdown for each of the counties. We then applied a Functional Principal Component (FPC) analysis on this dataset to generate scores that described the trajectory of COVID-19 spread across the counties. We used machine learning methods to identify important factors in the county including the date of lockdown that significantly influenced the FPC scores.

FindingsWe found that the first FPC score accounted for up to 92.81% of the variations in the absolute rates of COVID-19 as well as the topology of COVID-19 spread over time at a county level. The relation between incidence of COVID-19 and time at a county level demonstrated a hockey-stick appearance with an inflection point approximately 7 days prior to the county reporting at least 5 new cases of COVID-19; beyond this inflection point, there was an exponential increase in incidence. Among the risk factors, lockdown and total population were the two most significant features of the county that influenced the rate of COVID-19 infection, while the median family income, median age and within-county move also substantially affect COVID spread.

InterpretationLockdowns are an effective way of controlling the COVID-19 spread in communities. However, significant delays in lockdown cause a dramatic increase in the case counts. Thus, the timing of the lockdown relative to the case count is an important consideration in controlling the pandemic in communities.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed using the term ""coronavirus"", OR ""COVID-19"", OR ""COVID-19 infection"", OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" combined with ""Lockdown"" or ""sociodemographic factor"" or ""Vulnerability"" for original articles published before March 18, 2021. Similar searches were done in medRxiv, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Only papers published in English were reviewed. The most similar relevant works to our study were Acharya et al.1 and Karmakar et al.2, which investigated the associations between population-level social factors and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Unlike our current study, which employed a longitudinal design, both of studies were cross-sectional in nature and thus fixed on a single time point. In addition, neither of these studies investigated the impact of lockdown measures on COVID-19 infection patterns. Another relevant study is Alfano et al.s work3, which focused on the efficacy of lockdown on COVID-19 case rates. However, this study did not evaluate the timing of lockdown on this endpoint.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to use functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to investigate COVID-19 infection trajectories (in a longitudinal manner) and their relationships with different sociodemographic factors and lockdown policy at a county level. The FPCA transformed a longitudinal vector with high-dimensions into a ""single"" surrogate variable, which retained 93% of the information. We used an advanced statistical model (segmented regression) to investigate the effects of lockdown on incidence of COVID-19 across the US. We found that the relationship had a ""hockey stick"" appearance with an inflection point at [~]7 days prior to a county reporting at least 5 cases of COVID-19. We also applied a machine learning model (i.e., elastic net) to explore joint effects of lockdown and other sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 infection patterns, which estimated the impact of each of factors, adjusted for each other.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study suggests that lockdown is an effective policy to reduce case counts of COVID-19 in communities; however, significant delays in its implementation result in exponential growth of COVID-19. The inflection point is approximately 7 days prior to a county reporting at least 5 cases of COVID-19. These data will help policy-makers to determine the optimal timing of lockdowns for their communities.",Xiaolin Huang; Xiaojian Shao; Li Xing; Yushan Hu; Don Sin; Xuekui Zhang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253997,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253997,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
126,Mortality in individuals treated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma varies with the geographic provenance of donors,"Treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have attempted to harness the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) including the development of successful COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics (e.g., Remdesivir, convalescent plasma [CP]). Evidence that SARS-CoV-2 exists as quasispecies evolving locally suggests that immunological differences may exist that could impact the effectiveness of antibody-based treatments and vaccines. Regional variants of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in the USA beginning in November 2020 but were likely present earlier. There is available evidence that the effectiveness of CP obtained from donors infected with earlier strains in the pandemic may be reduced when tested for neutralization against newer SARS-Cov-2 variants. Using data from the Expanded Access Program to convalescent plasma, we used a gradient-boosting machine to identify predictors of 30-day morality and a series of regression models to estimate the relative risk of death at 30 days post-transfusion for those receiving near sourced plasma (defined as plasma transported [&le;] 150 miles) vs. distantly sourced plasma (> 150 miles). Our results show a lower risk of death at 30 days post-transfusion for near sourced plasma. Additional analyses stratified by disease severity, time to treatment, and donor region further supported these findings. The results of this study suggest that near sourced plasma is superior to distantly sourced plasma, which has implications for interpreting the results of clinical studies and designing effective treatment of COVID-19 patients as additional local variant are likely to emerge.",Katie L Kunze; Patrick W Johnson; Noud van Helmond; Jonathon W Senefeld; Molly M Petersen; Stephen A Klassen; Chad C Wiggins; Allan M Klompas; Katelyn A Bruno; John R Mills; Elitza S Theel; Matthew R Buras; Michael A Golafshar; Matthew A Sexton; Juan C Diaz Soto; Sarah E Baker; John R.A.

127,T-cell receptor sequencing identifies prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates with neutralizing antibody titers and disease severity,"Measuring the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can enable the assessment of past infection as well as protective immunity and the risk of reinfection. While neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are one measure of protection, such assays are challenging to perform at a large scale and the longevity of the SARS-CoV-2 nAb response is not fully understood. Here, we apply a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay that can be performed on a small volume standard blood sample to assess the adaptive T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were collected from a cohort of 302 individuals recovered from COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection. Previously published findings in this cohort showed that two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays correlate well with nAb testing. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response strongly correlates with nAb titer, as well as clinical indicators of disease severity including hospitalization, fever, or difficulty breathing. While the depth and breadth of the T-cell response declines during convalescence, the T-cell signal remains well above background with high sensitivity up to at least 6 months following initial infection. Compared to serology tests detecting binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, the overall sensitivity of the TCR-based assay across the entire cohort and all timepoints was approximately 5% greater for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the improved performance of T-cell testing compared to serology was most apparent in recovered individuals who were not hospitalized and were sampled beyond 150 days of their initial illness, suggesting that antibody testing may have reduced sensitivity in individuals who experienced less severe COVID-19 illness and at later timepoints. Finally, T-cell testing was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in 68% (55/81) of convalescent samples having nAb titers below the lower limit of detection, as well as 37% (13/35) of samples testing negative by all three antibody assays. These results demonstrate the utility of a TCR-based assay as a scalable, reliable measure of past SARS-CoV-2 infection across a spectrum of disease severity. Additionally, the TCR repertoire may be useful as a surrogate for protective immunity with additive clinical value beyond serologic or nAb testing methods.",Rebecca Elyanow; Thomas M.

128,Weekly SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic students and staff to guide and evaluate strategies for safer in-person learning,"BackgroundData suggest that COVID-19 transmission in K-12 schools is uncommon, but few studies have confirmed this using widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19, document the frequency of in-school transmission, and confirm feasibility of widespread asymptomatic screening in schools.

DesignProspective observational study

SettingSingle mid-sized suburban school district including 10 schools and a central office.

ParticipantsDistrict staff and students

InterventionsAsymptomatic screening PCR for SARS-CoV-2

MeasurementsConcurrent with a hybrid model and layered mitigation, weekly pooled testing of staff and secondary students was offered using saliva samples collected at home. Identification of >1 case in a school prompted investigation for possible in-school transmission. Staff and families were surveyed about satisfaction with the screening program.

ResultsFrom weeks 1-18, rates of incident COVID-19 in the surrounding community rose steadily. Weekly staff and student screening identified 0-7 asymptomatic cases/week. In week 7, 5 cases were identified among staff who shared an office setting. Enhancements to mitigation strategies were undertaken. The proportion of survey respondents self-reporting comfort with in-person learning before versus after implementation of screening increased.

LimitationsBecause screening testing was not mandatory, the results from the participating population might not represent the entire school community.

ConclusionsIn this school district with layered mitigation measures, in-school transmission was rare. The program identified a cluster with in-school staff-to-staff transmission and spurred enhancement of safety strategies. A weekly COVID-19 screening program can provide critical data to inform mitigation efforts, and provides school-specific, current data to inform decisions about in-person learning models. Screening provided reassurance and identified asymptomatic cases.

129,Older biological age is associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes: A cohort study in UK Biobank,"BackgroundOlder chronological age is the most powerful risk factor for adverse coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcomes. It is uncertain, however, whether older biological age, as assessed by leucocyte telomere length (LTL), is also associated with COVID-19 outcomes.

MethodsWe associated LTL values obtained from participants recruited into UK Biobank (UKB) during 2006-2010 with adverse COVID-19 outcomes recorded by 30 November 2020, defined as a composite of any of the following: hospital admission, need for critical care, respiratory support, or mortality. Using information on 131 LTL-associated genetic variants, we conducted exploratory Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses in UKB to evaluate whether observational associations might reflect cause-and-effect relationships.

FindingsOf 6,775 participants in UKB who had tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the community, there were 914 (13.5%) with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The odds ratio (OR) for adverse COVID-19 outcomes was 1{middle dot}17 (95% CI 1{middle dot}05-1{middle dot}31; P=0{middle dot}004) per 1-SD shorter usual LTL, after adjustment for chronological age, sex and ethnicity. Similar ORs were observed in analyses that: adjusted for additional risk factors; disaggregated the composite outcome and reduced the scope for selection or collider bias. In MR analyses, the OR for adverse COVID-19 outcomes was directionally concordant but non-significant.

InterpretationShorter LTL, indicative of older biological age, is associated with higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, independent of several major risk factors for COVID-19 including chronological age. Further data are needed to determine whether this association reflects causality.

130,Evaluating the neutralizing ability of a CpG-adjuvanted S-2P subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern,"Vaccination is currently the best weapon to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, an alarming number of novel variants termed Variants of Concern (VoC) were found to harbor mutations that diminished the neutralizing capacity of antibodies elicited by the vaccines. We have investigated the neutralizing titers of antibodies from sera of humans and rats immunized with the MVC-COV1901 vaccine against pseudoviruses coated with the wildtype, D614G, B.1.1.7, or B.1.351 spike proteins. Rats vaccinated with two doses of adjuvanted S-2P retained neutralization activities against the B.1.351 variant, albeit with a slight reduction compared to wildtype. Phase 1 vaccinated subjects showed more reduced neutralization abilities against the B.1.351 variant. The study is among the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate dose-dependent neutralizing responses against VoCs, particularly against B.1.351, from different doses of antigen in a clinical trial for a subunit protein COVID-19 vaccine. The appearance of vaccine escape variants is a growing concern facing many current COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Strategies should be adopted against the ever-changing nature of these variants.

131,Lives Saved from Age-Prioritised COVID-19 Vaccination,"BACKGROUNDThe criteria used to allocate scarce COVID-19 vaccines are hotly contested. While some are pushing just to get vaccines into arms as quickly as possible, others advocate prioritization in terms of risk.

OBJECTIVEOur aim is to use demographic models to show the enormous potential of vaccine risk-prioritization in saving lives.

METHODSWe develop a simple mathematical model that accounts for the age distribution of the population and of COVID-19 mortality. This model considers only the direct live-savings for those who receive the vaccine, and does not account for possible indirect effects of vaccination. We apply this model to the United States, Japan, and Bangladesh.

RESULTSIn the United States, we find age-prioritization would reduce deaths during a vaccine campaign by about 93 percent relative to no vaccine and 85 percent relative to age-neutral vaccine distribution. In countries with younger age structures, such as Bangladesh, the benefits of age-prioritization are even greater.

CONTRIBUTIONFor policy makers, our findings give additional support to risk-prioritized allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. For demographers, our results show how the age-structures of the population and of disease mortality combine into an expression of risk concentration that shows the benefits of prioritized allocation. This measure can also be used to study the effects of prioritizing other dimensions of risk such as underlying health conditions.",Joshua R Goldstein; Ayesha Mahmud; Thomas Cassidy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253991,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253991,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
132,The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different freshwaters of urban settings determined by RT-qPCR: implications for water safety,"This is the first study focused on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different freshwater environments of an urban setting. Groundwater and surface water reservoirs for drinking water as well as water from receiving rivers of Monterrey Metropolitan Area were sampled repeatedly during a peak phase between October 2020 and January 2021, and the virus RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Forty-four percent of groundwater samples demonstrated detectable virus loads between 2.9 and 5.6 copies/ml. A significant correlation with sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed the hypothesis of leaching and infiltration of effluents from surface and/or failing sewage pipes, and emphases the importance of water disinfection. Thirteen percent of surface water dam samples tested positive, with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 21% of river samples marked positive for viral RNA, with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 copies/ml. Raw wastewater samples taken in the same period show viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or efficiency of wastewater facilities.

133,Primary care clinical management following self-harm during the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK,"BackgroundA substantial reduction in GP-recorded self-harm occurred during the first wave of COVID-19 but effects on primary care management of self-harm are unknown.

AimTo examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical management within three months of an episode of self-harm.

Design and settingProspective cohort study using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

MethodWe compared cohorts of patients with an index self-harm episode recorded during a pre-pandemic period (10th March-10th June, 2010-2019) versus the COVID-19 first-wave period (10th March-10th June 2020). Patients were followed up for three months to capture psychotropic medication prescribing, GP/practice nurse consultation and referral to mental health services.

Results48,739 episodes of self-harm were recorded during the pre-pandemic period and 4,238 during the first-wave COVID-19 period. Similar proportions were prescribed psychotropic medication within 3 months in the pre-pandemic (54.0%) and COVID-19 first-wave (54.9%) cohorts. Likelihood of having at least one GP/practice nurse consultation was broadly similar (83.2% vs. 80.3% in the COVID-19 cohort). The proportion of patients referred to mental health services in the COVID-19 cohort (3.4%) was around half of that in the pre-pandemic cohort (6.5%).

ConclusionDespite the challenges experienced by primary healthcare teams during the initial COVID-19 wave, prescribing and consultation patterns following self-harm were broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels. However, the reduced likelihood of referral to mental health services warrants attention. Accessible outpatient and community services for people who have self-harmed are required as the COVID-19 crisis recedes and the population faces new challenges to mental health.",Sarah Steeg; Matthew J Carr; Laszlo Trefan; Darren M Ashcroft; Nav Kapur; Emma Nielsen; Brian McMillan; Roger Webb,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253969,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
134,Emotional responses toward COVID-19: A longitudinal assessment of age differences,"The current study investigates the relation between age and emotional responses and coping strategies at two moments during the spread of COVID-19 in Poland, namely the first peak (March-May 2020) and the second pick (October-December 2020). A sample of 414 individuals between the ages of 18 and 81 were asked to rate the intensity of the  shock,  sadness,  anger, and  fear they experienced due to COVID-19 and respond to items from the Brief Cope questionnaire. The present findings demonstrate that anger was consistently less intense among older adults than younger ones. Emotion-focused coping strategies were more commonly used by younger adults than middle-aged or older ones at the first peak of the outbreak; however, this trend had reversed during the second peak of the pandemic, as the older age groups demonstrated a far greater increase in the use of this form of coping. Results indicate a greater ability to use emotional regulation among older adults than younger ones, as the former are less likely to react to a crisis through anger and more able to adapt coping mechanisms to a dynamic environment.",Marta Malesza,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254050,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254050,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
135,COVID 19 Vaccine Perceptions in the New York State Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Community,"BackgroundPeople with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are at disproportionate risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, particularly those living in congregate care settings. Yet, there is limited data on vaccine perceptions in the disability community.

ObjectiveTo explore COVID-19 vaccine perceptions in individuals with IDD, their family members, and those who work with them, to inform a statewide vaccine information and messaging project.

MethodsA national survey, adapted for the IDD community, was distributed to a convenience sample of IDD organizations throughout New York State, in five languages. Constructs included vaccine intention, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and trusted sources of vaccine information. Zip code data were used to map respondent location and vaccine preferences.

ResultsOf n= 825 respondents, approximately 75% intended to or had received the vaccine, across roles (i.e., people with disabilities, family members, direct care workers) and racial/ethnic groups. Greater vaccine hesitancy was reported in younger individuals and those making decisions on behalf of a person with IDD. Concerns included side effects and the swiftness of vaccine development. Black and Hispanic participants had heightened concerns about being an ""experiment"" for the vaccine. Trusted sources of information included healthcare providers and family members. Respondents who intended/got the vaccine were distributed throughout the state.

ConclusionsVaccine preferences in this New York State disability community sample align with national data. Identified concerns suggest the need for community education that addresses misperceptions.

136,Factors informing healthcare workers' willingness to work during the COVID-19 pandemic,"ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a substantial challenge to healthcare workers. Exploring the determinants of their willingness to work is crucial to ensuring hospital function during the outbreak. Hence, this study examines the factors affecting the motivation and hesitation of health workers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland.

Study DesignAn online, anonymous survey was carried out among Polish healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodThe respondents were asked about their demographic characteristics, stress-related factors, and their self-reported motivation and hesitation to work. The responses were gathered during September-December 2020.

Results912 valid responses were obtained. Of these, 22.8% (N = 208) respondents reported being strongly motivated to work while 37.8% (N = 345) expressed strong hesitation. The participants demographic characteristics and their responses to the stress-related questions were assigned to four categories depending on the odds ratios of motivation and hesitation. While some factors were linked to enhanced motivation and reduced hesitation, others solely affected either motivation or hesitation, and yet others had a positive impact on both.

ConclusionOverall, the study indicates that in order to increase hospital workers motivation and decrease their hesitation, they must be made to feel protected by both their hospitals and local and national authorities.",Marta Malesza,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254048,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254048,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
137,Job stress among workers who telecommute during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan: a cross-sectional study,"ObjectivesThe work system reform and the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan have prompted efforts toward telecommuting in Japan, and there has been little research regarding the stress and health effects of telecommuting. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between telecommuting and job stress among Japanese workers.

Study DesignThis was a cross-sectional study.

MethodsIn December 2020, during the  third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, an Internet-based nationwide health survey of 33,087 Japanese workers (CORoNaWork study) was conducted. Data for 27,036 individuals was included as 6,051 individuals provided invalid responses. We analysed a sample of 13,468 office workers from this database. We classified participants into four groups according to telecommuting frequency and compared the subscale of the Job Content Questionnaire and subjective job stress among these groups: high-frequency, medium-frequency, and low-frequency telecommuters group and non-telecommuters group. We used a linear mixed model and ordinal logistic regression analysis.

ResultsThere was a significant difference in the score of job control of the JCQ among the four groups after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. The high-frequency telecommuters group had the highest job control score. Regarding the fluctuation score of subjective job stress, the high- and medium-frequency telecommuters groups were significantly lower than those of the non-telecommuters group after adjusting for multiple confounding factors.

ConclusionWe found that high-frequency telecommuting was associated with high job control. This study suggests that the widespread adoption of telecommuting as a countermeasure to the public health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may also have a positive impact on job stress.",Kazunori Ikegami; Hiroka Baba; Hajime Ando; Ayako Hino; Mayumi Tusji; Seiichiro Tateishi; Tomohisa Nagata; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253958,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253958,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
138,Psychosocial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic: Identification of most vulnerable populations.,"With the aim of analyzing the psychosocial impact of Covid-19 pandemic on society in general and health care workers in particular, we developed a 74-question survey questionnaire which was shared through social media. After analyzing 56,656 responses obtained during the first pandemic peak, the results showed an early and important negative impact on family finances, fear of working with Covid-19 patients and ethical issues related to Covid-19 care among healthcare workers (HCW). We have identified 7 target groups at higher risk of impaired mental health and susceptible to benefiting from an intervention: women, under 42 years of age, people with care burden, socio-economically deprived groups, people with unskilled or unqualified jobs, Covid-19 patients, and HCW working with Covid-19 patients. These results should encourage the active implementation of specific strategies to increase resilience in these groups and to prepare an adequate organizational response.

139,Limit of detection in different matrices of nineteen commercially available rapid antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there has been an increase of the use of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT). The performance of Ag-RDT vary greatly between manufacturers and evaluating their analytical limit of detection (LOD) has become high priority. Here we describe a manufacturer-independent evaluation of the LOD of 19 marketed Ag-RDT using live SARS-CoV-2 spiked in different matrices: direct culture supernatant, a dry swab, and a swab in Amies. Additionally, the LOD using dry swab was investigated after 7 days storage at -80{degrees}C of the SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions. An LOD of {approx} 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (1.0 x 106 genome copies/ml) in culture media is defined as acceptable by the World Health Organization. Fourteen of nineteen Ag-RDTs (ActiveXpress, Espline, Excalibur, Innova, Joysbio, Mologic, NowCheck, Orient, PanBio, RespiStrip, Roche, Standard-F, Standard-Q and Sure-Status) exceeded this performance criteria using direct culture supernatant applied to the Ag-RDT. Six Ag-RDT were not compatible with Amies media and a decreased sensitivity of 2 to 20-fold was observed for eleven tests on the stored dilutions at -80{degrees}C for 7 days. Here, we provide analytical sensitivity data to guide appropriate test and sample type selection for use and for future Ag-RDT evaluations.",Ana I Cubas Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Thomas Edwards; Dominic Wooding; Kate Buist; Caitlin R Thompson; Christopher T Williams; Lisa Baldwin; Ian Patterson; Grant Hughes; Camille Escadafal; Jilian Sacks; Emily R Adams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253950,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253950,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,True
140,Changes in HIV Treatment Differentiated Care Utilization During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Zambia,"BackgroundDifferentiated service delivery (DSD) models aim to lessen the burden of HIV treatment on patients and providers in part by reducing requirements for facility visits and extending dispensing intervals. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, minimizing patient contact with healthcare facilities and other patients, while maintaining treatment continuity and avoiding loss to care, has become more urgent, resulting in efforts to increase DSD uptake. We assessed the extent to which DSD coverage and antiretroviral treatment (ART) dispensing intervals have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia.

MethodsWe used patient data from Zambias electronic medical record system (SmartCare) for 737 health facilities, representing about 3/4 of all ART patients nationally, to compare the numbers and proportional distributions of patients enrolled in DSD models in the six months before and six months after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Zambia in March 2020. Segmented linear regression was used to determine whether the introduction of COVID-19 into Zambia further accelerated the increase in DSD scale-up.

ResultsBetween September 2019 and August 2020, 181,317 patients aged 15+ (81,520 and 99,797 from September 1, 2019 to March 1, 2020 and from March 1 to August 31, 2020, respectively) enrolled in DSD models in Zambia. Overall participation in all DSD models increased over the study period, but uptake varied by model. The rate of acceleration increased in the second period for home ART delivery (152%), [&le;]2-month fast-track (143%), and 3-month MMD (139%). There were significant decelerations in the increase in enrolment for 4-6-month fast-track (-28%) and  other models (-19%).

ConclusionsParticipation in DSD models for stable ART patients in Zambia increased after the advent of COVID-19, but dispensing intervals diminished. Eliminating obstacles to longer dispensing intervals, including those related to supply chain management, should be prioritized to achieve the expected benefits of DSD models and minimize COVID-19 risk.",Youngji Jo; Sydney Rosen; Karla Therese L.

141,Developing machine learning models for predicting intensive care unit resource use during the COVID-19 pandemic,"ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic has put massive strains on hospitals, and tools to guide hospital planners in resource allocation during the ebbs and flows of the pandemic are urgently needed.

ObjectiveWe investigate whether Machine Learning (ML) can be used for predictions of intensive care requirements 5 and 10 days into the future.

DesignRetrospective design where health Records from 34,012 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was extracted. Random Forest (RF) models were trained to predict risk of ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation after n days (n = 5, 10).

SettingTwo Danish regions, encompassing approx. 2.5 million citizens.

ParticipantsAll patients from the bi-regional area with a registered positive SARS-CoV-2 test from March 2020 to January 2021.

Main outcomesPrediction of future 5- and 10-day requirements of ICU admission and ventilator use. Mortality was also predicted.

ResultsModels predicted 5-day risk of ICU admission with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.986 and 5-day risk of use of ventilation with an ROC-AUC of 0.995. The corresponding 5-day forecasting models predicted the needed ICU capacity with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.930 and use of ventilation with an R2 of 0.934. Performance was comparable but slightly reduced for 10-day forecasting models.

ConclusionsRandom Forest-based modelling can be used for accurate 5- and 10-day forecasting predictions of ICU resource requirements.

To fill the data gap for vaccine immunogenicity in NH residents, we examined antibody levels after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to spike, receptor binding domain (RBD) and for virus neutralization in 149 NH residents and 111 health care worker controls. SARS-CoV-2-naive NH residents mount antibody responses with nearly 4-fold lower median neutralization titers and half the anti-spike level compared to SARS-CoV-2-naive healthcare workers. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2-recovered vaccinated NH residents had neutralization, anti-spike and anti-RBD titers similar to SARS-CoV-2-recovered vaccinated healthcare workers. NH residents blunted antibody responses have important implications regarding the quality and durability of protection afforded by neoantigen vaccines.

We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study, the Arizona CoVHORT, among Arizona residents to elucidate the symptom profile of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 participants(16.2%) compared to laboratory-confirmed negative(22.4%) and untested general population participants(61.4%). Among the 1514 study participants, those who were COVID-19 positive were more likely to be Hispanic(33.5%) and more likely to report obesity > 30 kg/m2(34.7%) compared to COVID-19 negative participants(19.2%; 31.0%) and untested CoVHORT participants(13.8%; 23.8%).

145,Role of Combining Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Agents in COVID-19 Treatment: A Rapid Review,"Although primarily affecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 causes multiple organ damage. One of its grave consequences is a prothrombotic state that manifests as thrombotic, microthrombotic, and thromboembolic events.Therefore, understanding the effect of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in the context of COVID-19 treatment is important. The aim of this rapid review is to highlight the role of thrombosis in COVID-19 and provide new insights on the use of antithrombotic therapy in its management. A rapid systematic review was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews. Papers published in English on antithrombotic agent use and COVID-19 complications were eligible. Results showed that the use of anticoagulants increased survival and reduced thromboembolic events in patients. However, despite the use of anticoagulants, patients still suffered thrombotic events likely due to heparin resistance. Data on antiplatelet use in combination with anticoagulants in the setting of COVID-19 is quite scarce. Current side effects of anticoagulation therapy emphasize the need to update treatment guidelines. In this rapid review, we address a possible modulatory role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant combination against COVID{square}19 pathogenesis. This combination may be an effective form of adjuvant therapy against COVID{square}19 infection. However, further studies are needed to elucidate potential risks and benefits associated with this combination.

146,Network medicine links SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection to brain microvascular injury and neuroinflammation in dementia-like cognitive impairment,"BackgroundDementia-like cognitive impairment is an increasingly reported complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this complication remain unclear. A better understanding of causative processes by which COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment is essential for developing preventive interventions.

MethodsIn this study, we conducted a network-based, multimodal genomics comparison of COVID-19 and neurologic complications. We constructed the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome from protein-protein interaction assay and CRISPR-Cas9 based genetic assay results, and compared network-based relationships therein with those of known neurological manifestations using network proximity measures. We also investigated the transcriptomic profiles (including single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing) of Alzheimers disease (AD) marker genes from patients infected with COVID-19, as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the brains of AD patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsWe found significant network-based relationships between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation and brain microvascular injury pathways and processes which are implicated in AD. We also detected aberrant expression of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with COVID-19. While transcriptomic analyses showed relatively low expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in human brain, neuroinflammatory changes were pronounced. In addition, single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses showed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors (BSG and FURIN) and antiviral defense genes (LY6E, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFNAR1) was significantly elevated in brain endothelial cells of AD patients and healthy controls relative to neurons and other cell types, suggesting a possible role for brain microvascular injury in COVID-19-mediated cognitive impairment. Notably, individuals with the AD risk allele APOE E4/E4 displayed reduced levels of antiviral defense genes compared to APOE E3/E3 individuals.

ConclusionOur results suggest significant mechanistic overlap between AD and COVID-19, strongly centered on neuroinflammation and microvascular injury.

147,"Protease-activatable biosensors of SARS-CoV-2 infection for cell-based drug, neutralisation and virological assays","The world is in the grip of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, and there is an urgent unmet clinical need for effective antiviral therapies. Many inhibitors of viral enzymes identified in vitro have limited efficacy against viral replication in cells, but conventional plaque assays are impractical for high-throughput screens. In this study, we therefore engineer cell-based biosensors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our assays exploit the cleavage of specific oligopeptide linkers by SARS-CoV-2 Main or Papain-like proteases, leading to the activation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase-based reporters.

148,CVnCoV protects human ACE2 transgenic mice from ancestral B BavPat1 and emerging B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines as the primary control option. Recently, viral mutants termed ""variants of concern"" (VOC) have emerged with the potential to escape host immunity. VOC B.1.351 was first discovered in South Africa in late 2020, and causes global concern due to poor neutralization with propensity to evade preexisting immunity from ancestral strains. We tested the efficacy of a spike encoding mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against the ancestral strain BavPat1 and the novel VOC B.1.351 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice developed elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody as well as neutralization titers against the ancestral strain BavPat1. Neutralization titers against VOC B.1.351 were readily detectable but significantly reduced compared to BavPat1. VOC B.1.351-infected control animals experienced a delayed course of disease, yet nearly all SARS-CoV-2 challenged naive mice succumbed with virus dissemination and high viral loads. CVnCoV vaccine completely protected the animals from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in oral swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Only partial protection was observed in mice receiving the formalin-inactivated virus preparation. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV shows complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies.",Donata Hoffmann; Bjoern Corleis; Susanne Rauch; Nicole Roth; Janine Muehe; Nico Joel Halwe; Lorenz Ulrich; Charlie Fricke; Jacob Schoen; Anna Kraft; Angele Breithaupt; Kerstin Wernike; Anna Michelitsch; Franziska Sick; Claudia Wylezich; Stefan O.

149,"An mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: Lyophilized, liposome-based vaccine candidate EG-COVID induces high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies","In addition to the traditional method of vaccine development, the mRNA coronavirus vaccine, which is attractive as a challenging vaccination, recently opened a new era in vaccinology. Here we describe the EG-COVID which is a novel liposome-based mRNA candidate vaccine that encodes the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 2P-3Q substitution in European variant. We developed the mRNA vaccine platform that can be lyophilized using liposome-based technology. Intramuscular injection of the EG-COVID elicited robust humoral and cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, sera obtained from mice successfully inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral infection into Vero cells. We developed EG-COVID and found it to be effective based on in vitro data, and we plan to initiate a clinical trial soon.

150,Predicting hosts based on early SARS-CoV-2 samples and analyzing later world-wide pandemic in 2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has raised the concern for identifying hosts of the virus since the early-stage outbreak. To address this problem, we proposed a deep learning method, DeepHoF, based on extracting the viral genomic features automatically, to predict host likelihood scores on five host types, including plant, germ, invertebrate, non-human vertebrate and human, for novel viruses. DeepHoF made up for the lack of an accurate tool applicable to any novel virus and overcame the limitation of the sequence similarity-based methods, reaching a satisfactory AUC of 0.987 on the five-classification. Additionally, to fill the gap in the efficient inference of host species for SARS-CoV-2 using existed tools, we conducted a deep analysis on the host likelihood profile calculated by DeepHoF. Using the isolates sequenced in the earliest stage of COVID-19, we inferred minks, bats, dogs and cats were potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2, while minks might be one of the most noteworthy hosts. Several genes of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated their significance in determining the host range. Furthermore, the large-scale genome analysis, based on DeepHoFs computation for the later world-wide pandemic in 2020, disclosed the uniformity of host range among SARS-CoV-2 samples and the strong association of SARS-CoV-2 between humans and minks.",Qian Guo; Mo Li; Chunhui Wang; Jinyuan Guo; Xiaoqing Jiang; Jie Tan; Shufang Wu; Peihong Wang; Tingting Xiao; Zhencheng Fang; Yonghong Xiao; Huaiqiu Zhu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.436312,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.436312,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False

Here, we applied live bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to monitor the real-time effects of NAb treatment in prophylaxis and therapy of K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2-nanoluciferase. We visualized sequential spread of virus from the nasal cavity to the lungs followed by systemic spread to various organs including the brain, culminating in death. Highly potent NAbs from a COVID-19 convalescent subject prevented, and also effectively resolved, established infection when administered within three days of infection. In addition to direct neutralization, in vivo efficacy required Fc effector functions of NAbs, with contributions from monocytes, neutrophils and natural killer cells, to dampen inflammatory responses and limit immunopathology. Thus, our study highlights the requirement of both Fab and Fc effector functions for an optimal in vivo efficacy afforded by NAbs against SARS-CoV-2.",Irfan Ullah; Jeremie Prevost; Mark S.

152,Structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/human ACE2 complex interface can identify high-affinity variants associated with increased transmissibility,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are conformationally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S447N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S447N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.",Hin Hark Gan; Alan Twaddle; Benoit Marchand; Kris Gunsalus,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436454,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436454,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
153,TMPRSS2 inhibitor discovery facilitated through an in silico and biochemical screening platform,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for new antiviral targets, as many of the currently approved drugs have proven ineffective against mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The host transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is a highly promising antiviral target, as it plays a direct role in priming the spike protein before viral entry occurs. Further, unlike other targets such as ACE2, TMPRSS2 has no known biological role. Here we utilize virtual screening to curate large libraries into a focused collection of potential inhibitors. Optimization of a recombinant expression and purification protocol for the TMPRSS2 peptidase domain facilitates subsequent biochemical screening and characterization of selected compounds from the curated collection in a kinetic assay. In doing so, we demonstrate that serine protease inhibitors camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate inhibit through a covalent mechanism. We further identify new non-covalent compounds as TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors, demonstrating the utility of a combined virtual and experimental screening campaign in rapid drug discovery efforts.",Amanda L Peiffer; Julie M Garlick; Yujin Wu; Matthew B Soellner; Charles L Brooks III; Anna K Mapp,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436465,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436465,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False

While a two-dose immunization regimen with the BNT162b2 vaccine has been demonstrated to provide a 95% efficacy in naive individuals, the effects of the second vaccine dose in individuals who have previously recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection has been questioned. Here we characterized SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in naive and previously infected individuals during full BNT162b2 vaccination. Our results demonstrate that the second dose increases both the humoral and cellular immunity in naive individuals. On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.",Carmen Camara; Daniel Lozano-Ojalvo; Eduardo Lopez-Granados; Estela Paz-Artal; Marjorie Pion; Rafael Correa-Rocha; Alberto Ortiz; Marcos Lopez-Hoyos; Marta Erro Iribarren; Jose Portoles; Pilar Portoles; Mayte Perez-Olmeda; Jesus Oteo-Iglesias; Cecilia Berin; Ernesto Guccione; Antonio Bertoletti; Jordi Ochando,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436441,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436441,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
155,Characterisation of B.1.1.7 and Pangolin coronavirus spike provides insights on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmission, pathogenesis and immune resistance has jeopardised the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Determining the fundamental biology of viral variants and understanding their evolutionary trajectories will guide current mitigation measures, future genetic surveillance and vaccination strategies. Here we examine virus entry by the B.1.1.7 lineage, commonly referred to as the UK/Kent variant. Pseudovirus infection of model cell lines demonstrate that B.1.1.7 entry is enhanced relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain, particularly under low expression of receptor ACE2. Moreover, the entry characteristics of B.1.1.7 were distinct from that of its predecessor strain containing the D614G mutation. These data suggest evolutionary tuning of spike protein function. Additionally, we found that amino acid deletions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike were important for efficient entry by B.1.1.7. The NTD is a hotspot of diversity across sarbecoviruses, therefore, we further investigated this region by examining the entry of closely related CoVs. Surprisingly, Pangolin CoV spike entry was 50-100 fold enhanced relative to SARS-CoV-2; suggesting there may be evolutionary pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 may further optimise entry. Swapping the NTD between Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that changes in this region alone have the capacity to enhance virus entry. Thus, the NTD plays a hitherto unrecognised role in modulating spike activity, warranting further investigation and surveillance of NTD mutations.",Samuel J Dicken; Matthew J Murray; Lucy G Thorne; Ann-Kathrin Reuschl; Calum Forrest; Maaroothen Ganeshalingham; Luke Muir; Mphatso D Kalemera; Machaela Palor; Laura E McCoy; Clare Jolly; Greg J Towers; Matthew Reeves; Joe Grove,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436468,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436468,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
156,Replicative fitness SARS-CoV-2 20I/501Y.V1 variant in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium,"Since its emergence in 2019, circulating populations of the new coronavirus continuously acquired genetic diversity. At the end of 2020, a variant named 20I/501Y.V1 (lineage B.1.1.7) emerged and replaced other circulating strains in several regions. This phenomenon has been poorly associated to biological evidence that this variant and original strain exhibit different phenotypic characteristics. Here, we analyse the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain (lineage B1). Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However, when both viruses were put in competition in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that this new variant replicates more efficiently and could contribute to better understand the progressive replacement of circulating strains by the SARS-CoV-2 20I/501Y.V1 variant.

ImportanceThe emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants raised numerous questions concerning the future course of the pandemic. We are currently observing a replacement of the circulating viruses by the variant from the United Kingdom known as 20I/501Y.V1 from B.1.1.7 lineage but there is little biological evidence that this new variant exhibit a different phenotype. In the present study, we used different cellular models to assess the replication ability of the 20I/501Y.V1 variant. Our results showed that this variant replicate more efficiently in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, which may explain why it spreads so rapidly in human populations.",Franck Touret; Lea Luciani; Cecile Baronti; Maxime Cochin; Jean-Selim Driouich; Magali Gilles; Laurence Thirion; Antoine Nougairede; Xavier de Lamballerie,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436427,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436427,2021-03-22,2021-03-22,,False
157,A Queuing Model for Ventilator Capacity Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"We present a queue model to inform ventilator capacity management under different COVID-19 pandemic scenarios. Our model was used to support ventilator capacity planning during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The core of our framework is an extended Erlang loss model, which incorporates COVID-19 case projections, along with the proportion of cases requiring a ventilator, the delay from symptom onset to ventilation, non-COVID-19 ventilator demand, and ventilation time. We implemented our model using discrete event simulation to forecast ventilator utilization. The results predict when capacity would be reached and the rate at which patients would be unable to access a ventilator. We further determined the number of ventilators required to meet a performance indicator target for ventilator access. We applied our model to BC by calibrating to the BC Intensive Care Unit Database and by using local epidemic projections. Epidemic scenarios with and without reduced transmission, due to social distancing and other behavioral changes, were used to link public health interventions to operational impacts on ventilator utilization. The results predict that reduced transmission could potentially avert up to 50 deaths per day by ensuring that ventilator capacity would likely not be reached. Without reduced transmission, an additional 181 ventilators would be required to meet our performance indicator target that 95% of patients can access a ventilator immediately.

While Spike mutations that enhance virus infectivity may drive the emergence of these novel variants, studies documenting a critical a role for interferon responses in the early control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, combined with the presence of viral genes that limit these responses, suggest that interferons may also influence SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here, we compared the potency of 17 different human interferons against 5 viral lineages sampled during the course of the global outbreak that included ancestral and emerging variants. Our data revealed increased interferon resistance in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicating that evasion of innate immunity is a significant driving force for SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, via binding human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2)1,2, and infection can result in pneumonia and acute respiratory dist ress syndrome. Circadian rhythms coordinate an organisms response to its environment and recent studies report a role for the circadian clock to regulate host susceptibility to virus infection3. Influenza A infection of arhythmic mice, lacking the circadian component BMAL1, results in higher viral replication4 and elevated inflammatory responses leading to more severe bronchitis5,6, highlighting the impact of circadian pathways in respiratory function. We demonstrate circadian regulation of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells and show that silencing BMAL1 or treatment with the synthetic REV-ERB agonist SR9009 reduces ACE2 expression and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry and RNA replication. Treating infected cells with SR9009 limits viral replication and secretion of infectious particles, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are influenced by the circadian system.

Here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning (ML), and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate the differences in RBD binding by the two viruses. Although only subtle differences were observed from the initial MD simulations of the two RBD-ACE2 complexes, ML identified the individual residues with the most distinctive ACE2 interactions, many of which have been highlighted in previous experimental studies. FEP calculations quantified the corresponding differences in binding free energies to ACE2, and examination of MD trajectories provided structural explanations for these differences.

165,Cancer services during the COVID-19 pandemic: systematic review of patients' and caregivers' experiences,"BackgroundCancer patients have faced intersecting crises in the face of COVID-19 pandemic. This review aimed to examine patients and caregivers experiences of accessing cancer services during the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived impact of the pandemic on their psychological wellbeing.

MethodsA protocol-led (CRD42020214906) systematic review was conducted by searching six databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL for articles published in English-language between 1/2020-12/2020. Data were extracted using a pilot-tested, structured data extraction form. Thematic synthesis of data was undertaken and reported as per the PRISMA guideline.

ResultsA total of 1110 articles were screened of which 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies originated from 10 different countries including the US, UK, India and China. Several themes were identified which were categorised into seven categories. Postponement and delays in cancer screening and treatment, drug shortages and inadequate nursing care were commonly experienced by patients. Hospital closures, resource constraints, national lockdowns and patient reluctance to use health services because of infection worries contributed to the delay. Financial and social distress, isolation; and spiritual distress due to the uncertainty of rites as well as fulfilment of last wishes were also commonly reported. Caregivers felt anxious about infecting cancer patients with COVID-19.

ConclusionsPatients and caregivers experienced extensive impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening, treatment and care, and their own psychological wellbeing. Patient and caregiver views and preferences should be incorporated in ensuring resilient cancer services that can minimise the impact of ongoing and future pandemic on cancer care and mitigate patient fears.

166,The effects of physical distancing and lockdown to restrain SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the Italian Municipality of Cogne,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 started in Wuhan, China, and is now a pandemic. An understanding of the prevalence and contagiousness of the disease, and of whether the strategies used to contain it to date have been successful, is important for understanding future containment strategies. One strategy for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is to adopt strong social distancing policies. The Municipality of Cogne (I), adopted strict lockdown rules from March 4, 2020 up to May 18, 2020. This first wave of the pandemic impressed by the extremely low impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the locals, compared to the number accused on all the Italian territory. Starting from October 2020 up to the end of December, when the second wave hit Italy and Cogne territory, heavier effects were observed. In order to cast light on the effectiveness of the adopted strategy 74,5% of the local population underwent to a blood screening to detect IgM and IgG antibodies and after six months all the people tested positive were again investigated to establish the longitudinal changes in antibodies level.

167,A Prospective Study of Long-Term Outcomes Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients with and without Neurological Complications,"BackgroundLittle is known regarding long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective study of 6-month outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with new neurological complications during hospitalization who survived were propensity score-matched to COVID-19 survivors without neurological complications hospitalized during the same period. The primary 6-month outcome was multivariable ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (ADLs;Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep.

ResultsOf 606 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, 395 survived hospitalization and were matched to 395 controls; N=196 neurological patients and N=186 controls completed follow-up. Overall, 346/382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal outcome: 56% had limited ADLs, 50% impaired cognition, 47% could not return to work and 62% scored worse than average on [&ge;]1 Neuro-QoL scale (worse anxiety 46%, sleep 38%, fatigue 36%, and depression 25%). In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications had worse 6-month mRS (median 4 vs. 3 among controls, adjusted OR 2.03, 95%CI 1.22-3.40, P=0.01), worse ADLs (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.29-0.74, P=0.01) and were less likely to return to work than controls (41% versus 64%, P=0.04). Cognitive and Neuro-QOL metrics were similar between groups.

168,Integrated immunovirological profiling validates plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA as an early predictor of COVID-19 mortality,"Despite advances in COVID-19 management, it is unclear how to recognize patients who evolve towards death. This would allow for better risk stratification and targeting for early interventions. However, the explosive increase in correlates of COVID-19 severity complicates biomarker prioritisation. To identify early biological predictors of mortality, we performed an immunovirological assessment (SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, cytokines and tissue injury markers, antibody responses) on plasma samples collected from 144 hospitalised COVID-19 patients 11 days after symptom onset and used to test models predicting mortality within 60 days of symptom onset. In the discovery cohort (n=61, 13 fatalities), high SARS-CoV-2 vRNA, low RBD-specific IgG levels, low SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and elevated levels of several cytokines and lung injury markers were strongly associated with increased mortality in the entire cohort and the subgroup on mechanical ventilation. Model selection revealed that a three-variable model of vRNA, age and sex was very robust at identifying patients who will succumb to COVID-19 (AUC=0.86, adjusted HR for log-transformed vRNA=3.5; 95% CI: 2.0-6.0). This model remained robust in an independent validation cohort (n=83, AUC=0.85).

169,Heightened COVID-19 Vaccine Response following SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines now available are highly effective at preventing infection and afford the prospect of an end to the pandemic. Vaccines are in scare supply, however. Current recommendations in the United States are that subjects with a previous history of SARS CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease should receive the full vaccine regimen. This is despite the fact that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection infection confers some degree of protection and that the immune response to the vaccine is not well studied.

MethodsThe present study compared the time course and magnitude of the humoral immune response to an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2) in subjects with prior infection/COVID-19 disease (n=24) and those without prior infection (n=25). Serum anti-Spike RBD antibody and serum neutralizing activity were assessed longitudinally prior to and at 2-week intervals for 56 days post first dose of vaccine. Subjects received the standard Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine regimen i.e., two doses of 30 {micro}g, 3 weeks apart.

FindingsThe cohort with prior COVID-19 achieved robust increases in anti-Spike IgG antibody and serum neutralizing activity compared to the SARS-CoV-2 naive cohort at day 14 post vaccine. Thereafter, the COVID-19 cohort showed relatively little further increase in humoral immunity even after the second dose such that anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing activity were similar in the 2 groups from day 28 through day 56.

ConclusionsIn contrast to the responses of SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects in whom a 2 dose regimen appears to be required to achieve robust immune protection, subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit immune memory and have a robust response to the first dose of an mRNA vaccine. They may require only a single dose of vaccine.",Steven G. Kelsen; Alan Braverman; Puja Patel; Mark O.

170,"Development and validation of the long covid symptom and impact tools, a set of patient-reported instruments constructed from patients' lived experience","ObjectivesTo develop and validate patient-reported instruments, based on patients lived experiences, for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.

DesignThe long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long covid. Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 and symptoms extending over three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-covid functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The ""patient acceptable symptomatic state"" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method.

ResultsValidation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed covid-19, 79% female and 12.5% hospitalised for covid-19). The long covid ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and 0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33).

ConclusionsThe long covid ST and IT tools, constructed from patients lived experiences, provide the first validated and reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.

171,Assessing the utility of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19,"BackgroundCOronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be challenging to diagnose, because symptoms are non-specific, clinical presentations are heterogeneous, and false negative tests can occur. Our objective was to assess the utility of lymphocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 or another respiratory infection (i.e., influenza, CAP) at seven hospitals in Ontario, Canada.The first available lymphocyte count during the hospitalization was used. Standard test characteristics for lymphocyte count (x109/L) were calculated (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve [AUC]). All analyses were conducting using R.

ResultsThere were 869 hospitalizations for COVID-19, 669 for influenza, and 3009 for CAP. The mean age across the three groups was 67 and patients with pneumonia were older than those with influenza or COVID19, and approximately 46% were woman. The median lymphocyte count was nearly identical for the three groups of patients: 1.0 x109/L (interquartile range [IQR]:0.7,2.0) for COVID-19, 0.9 x109/L (IQR 0.6,1.0) for influenza, and 1.0 x109/L (IQR 0.6,2.0) for CAP. At a lymphocyte threshold of less than 2.0 x109/L, the sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was approximately 10%. As the lymphocyte threshold increased, the sensitivity of diagnosing COVID-19 increased while the specificity decreased. The AUC for lymphocyte count was approximately 50%.

InterpretationLymphocyte count has poor diagnostic discrimination to differentiate between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. The lymphopenia we consistently observed across the three illnesses in our study may reflect a non-specific sign of illness severity. However, lymphocyte count above 2.0 x109/L may be useful in ruling out COVID-19 (sensitivity = 87%).",Mike Fralick; Orly Bogler; Daniel Tamming; Lauren Lapointe-Shaw; Janice Kwan; Terence Tang; Shail Rawal; Jessica Liu; Fahad Razak; Amol A Verma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21252922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21252922,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
172,Comparing the efficacy of anti-infectious drugs for the treatment of mild to severe COVID-19 patients: a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a viral infection spreading at a great speed and has quickly caused an extensive burden to individuals, families, countries, and the world. No intervention has yet been proven highly effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Different drugs were being evaluated and reported through randomized clinical trials, and more are currently under trial. This review aimed to compare the efficacy of anti-infectious drugs with a comparator of the standard of care or placebo in patients with COVID-19.

Methods and analysisTwo independent review authors will extract data and assess a risk of bias using RoB2. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that evaluate single and/or combined antiviral drugs recommended by WHO latest guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 will be included. We will search for Pub Med, the Cochrane Center for Clinical Trial database (CENTRAL), clinicaltrials.gov, etc. databases for articles published in the English language between December 2019 to April 2021. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) involving Network Meta-analysis guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoints will be time to clinical recovery and time to RNA negativity. The certainty of evidence will be evaluated using the GRADE extension of NMA. Data analysis will be performed using the frequentist NMA approach with netmeta package implemented in R.

Ethics and disseminationThere are no ethical considerations associated with this study as we will use publicly available data from previously published studies. We plan to publish results in open access peer-reviewed journals.

173,"First wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pandemic preparedness powered by early warning: A study of Ahmedabad, India","Following the proven concept, capabilities, and limitations of detecting the RNA of Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater, it is pertinent to understand the utility of wastewater surveillance data on various scale. In the present work, we put forward the first wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pandemic preparedness. A three-month data of Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP) was generated for the world heritage city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. In this expedition, one hundred sixteen wastewater samples were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, from September 3rd to November 26th, 2020. A total of 111 samples were detected with at least two out of three SARS-CoV-2 genes (N, ORF 1ab, and S). Monthly variation depicted a significant decline in all three gene copies in October compared to September 2020, followed by a sharp increment in November 2020. Correspondingly, the descending order of average genome concentration was: November ([~]10729 copies/ L) > September ([~]3047 copies/ L) > October ([~]454 copies/ L). Monthly variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples may be ascribed to a decline of 19.3% in the total number of active cases in October 2020 and a rise of 1.82% in November 2020. Also, the monthly recovery rate of patients was 16.61, 19.31, and 15.58% in September, October, and November 2020, respectively. The percentage change in the genome concentration was observed in the lead of 1-2 weeks with respect to the provisional figures of confirmed cases. SWEEP data-based city zonation was matched with the heat map of the overall COVID-19 infected population in Ahmedabad city, and month-wise effective RNA concentration variations are shown on the map. The results expound on the potential of WBE surveillance of COVID-19 as a city zonation tool that can be meaningfully interpreted, predicted, and propagated for community preparedness through advance identification of COVID-19 hotspots within a given city.

Results89.3% of elementary students included in our study did not maintain 6 feet of physical distancing in the classroom and 94.8% were within 6 feet in lunchrooms. The majority of secondary students (86.2%) were able to maintain 6 feet of distancing in the classroom but no students were greater than 6 feet in the hallways. 58.8% of schools did not install new ventilation systems prior to the school year. Students ate lunch indoors. Bussing of students continued and all elementary children were allowed to go without masks at recess.

Conclusion and relevanceIn the setting of high community COVID-19 disease transmission, 6 feet of distance between elementary students and major ventilation system renovations in primary or secondary schools do not appear to be necessary to minimize disease spread. Requiring masks at recess and prohibiting bussing also appears unnecessary.

175,Sarcopenic obesity and the risk of hospitalisation or death from COVID-19: findings from UK Biobank,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease{square}2019 (COVID{square}19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS{square}CoV{square}2 virus). The role of skeletal muscle mass in modulating immune response is well documented. Whilst obesity is well-established as a key factor in COVID-19 infection and outcome, no study has examined the influence of both sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and obesity, termed  sarcopenic obesity on COVID-19 risk.

MethodsThis study uses data from UK Biobank. Probable sarcopenia was defined as low handgrip strength. Sarcopenic obesity was mutually exclusively defined as the presence of obesity and low muscle mass (based on two established criteria: appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted for either: 1) height and 2) body mass index (BMI)).  Severe COVID-19 was defined by a positive test result in a hospital setting or death with a primary cause reported as COVID-19. Fully adjusted logistic regression models were used to analyse the associations between sarcopenic status and severe COVID-19. This work was conducted under UK Biobank application number 52553.

ResultsWe analysed data from 490,301 UK Biobank participants. 2203 (0.4%) had severe COVID-19 infection. Individuals with probable sarcopenia were 64% more likely to have had severe COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR) 1.638; P<.001). Obesity increased the likelihood of severe COVID-19 infection by 76% (P<.001). Using either ALM index and ALM/BMI index to define low muscle mass, those with sarcopenic obesity were 2.6 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 (OR: 2.619; P<.001). Sarcopenia alone did not increase the risk of COVID-19.

ConclusionsSarcopenic obesity may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection, over that of obesity alone. The mechanisms for this are complex but could be a result of a reduction in respiratory functioning, immune response, and ability to respond to metabolic stress.",Thomas Wilkinson; Thomas Yates; Luke A Baker; Francesco Zaccardi; Alice C Smith,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253945,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253945,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
176,Effect of Increased Alcohol Consumption During COVID-19 Pandemic on Alcohol-related Liver Disease: A Modelling Study,"ObjectivesThe burden of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is surging in the US. There is evidence that alcohol consumption increased during the early periods of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We describe the impact of increased alcohol consumption on alcohol-related liver disease.

DesignMicrosimulation model

SettingModel parameters estimated from publicly available data sources, including national surveys on drug and alcohol use and published studies informing the impact of alcohol consumption on ALD severity.

ParticipantsUS residents

MethodsWe extended a previously validated microsimulation model that estimated the short- and long-term effect of increased drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals in the US born between 1950-2012. We modelled short- and long-term outcomes of current drinking patterns during COVID-19 (status quo) using survey data of changes in alcohol consumption in a nationally representative sample between February and April 2020. We compared these outcomes with a counter-factual scenario wherein no COVID-19 occurs, and drinking patterns do not change. Reported outcomes are for individuals aged 18-65.

Main outcome measuresALD-related deaths inclusive of HCC mortality, the prevalence and incidence of decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)

ResultsIncreases in alcohol consumption during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic are estimated to result in to 8,200 [95% UI 7,700 - 8,700] additional ALD-related deaths (1% increase compared with the counter-factual scenario), 17,100 [95% UI 16,100 - 18,200] cases of decompensated cirrhosis (2% increase) and 1,100 [95% UI 1,100 - 1,200] cases of HCC (1% increase) between 2020 and 2040. Between 2020 and 2023, alcohol consumption changes due to COVID-19 will lead to 100 [100-200] additional deaths and 2,200 [2,200-2,300] additional decompensations in patients suffering from alcohol-related liver disease.

ConclusionsA short-term increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic can substantially increase long-term ALD-related morbidity and mortality.

177,Smoking and Vaping Among a National Sample of U.S. Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionWith concerns about cigarette smoking being a risk factor for severe disease from COVID-19, understanding nicotine and tobacco use patterns is important for preventive efforts. We aimed to understand changes in product use behaviors among U.S. adult combustible cigarette smokers and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users.

MethodsIn August 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of adults age >18 in NORCs AmeriSpeak Panel who reported past 6-month use of combustible cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with increased product use and quit attempts since hearing about COVID-19.

Results1024 past 6-month cigarette smokers and/or e-cigarette users were surveyed. Among cigarette smokers, 45% reported no change in cigarette smoking and 33% increased cigarette smoking since hearing about COVID-19. Higher stress was associated with increased cigarette smoking. Among e-cigarette users, 41% reported no change in and 23% reported increasing e-cigarette use. 26% of cigarette smokers and 41% of e-cigarette users tried to quit because of COVID-19. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 was associated with attempts to quit combustible cigarettes (AOR 2.37, 95% CI 1.59-3.55) and e-cigarettes (AOR 3.14, 1.73-5.70).

ConclusionsCigarette and e-cigarette use patterns varied in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users perceived product use as increasing COVID-19-related health risks, and this was associated with attempts to quit. Others, especially those reporting higher stress, increased product use. Proactive provision of cessation support to smokers and e-cigarette users may help mitigate stress-related increases in product use during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Sara Kalkhoran; Douglas E Levy; Nancy A Rigotti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253902,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253902,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
178,COVID-19 Implications of the Physical Interaction of Artificial Fog on Respiratory Aerosols,"IntroductionArtificial fog is used in the film, television, and live entertainment industries to enhance lighting, as a visual effect, and to create a specific sense of mood or atmosphere. This study investigated whether the suspension time of respiratory aerosols spiked with tagged DNA tracers would change in the presence of glycerin- or glycol-containing artificial fogs.

Methods & MaterialsRespiratory aerosols with tagged DNA tracers were sprayed into a closed environment without and with glycerin- or glycol-containing artificial fog, with air samples taken at regular intervals to determine the decay of tagged DNA tracer over time. The study treatments included Control (no fog), Glycerin Low (3 mg/m3), Glycerin High ([~]15 mg/m3), Glycol Low ([~]5 mg/m3), and Glycol High ([~]40 mg/m3).

ResultsAll artificial fog treatments had lower mean log reduction curves compared to the Control treatment. Compared to the Control and Glycerin Low treatments, the differences in mean log reduction for nearly all other artificial fog treatments were statistically significant (p<0.001); the difference between Control and Glycerin Low treatments was not statistically significant (p=0.087). The differences in mean log reduction between treatments using the same artificial fog type were not statistically significant.

ConclusionArtificial fog use does not increase suspension time of respiratory aerosols, and therefore does not appear to increase the risk of airborne transmission of diseases from respiratory aerosols, such as COVID-19. Of the two types of artificial fogs investigated, that containing glycol decreased suspension time more than that containing glycerin. In practice, the additional reduction in suspension time provided by the physical interaction of respiratory aerosols with artificial fog does not suggest any practical benefit for using artificial fog as a control measure.",Matthew Loss; Mark Katchen; Ilan Arvelo; Phil Arnold; Mona Shum,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253891,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253891,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
179,Predicting clinical outcomes in the Machine Learning era: The Piacenza score a purely data driven approach for mortality prediction in COVID-19 Pneumonia,"BackgroundSeveral models have been developed to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but only few have demonstrated enough discriminatory capacity. Machine-learning(ML) algorithms represent a novel approach for data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modelling. We developed the Piacenza score, a ML-based score, to predict 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods852 patients (mean age 70years, 70%males) were enrolled from February to November 2020. The dataset was randomly splitted into derivation and test. The Piacenza score was obtained through the Naive Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients. Using a forward-search algorithm the following six features were identified: age; mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration; PaO2 /FiO2 ratio; temperature; previous stroke; gender. In case one or more of the features are not available for a patient, the model can be re-trained using only the provided features.

We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a Naive Bayes algorithm with 14 variables chosen a-priori.

ResultsThe Piacenza score showed an AUC of 0.78(95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier-score 0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79(95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier-score 0.16) in the external validation cohort showing a comparable accuracy respect to the 4C score and to the Naive Bayes model with a-priori chosen features, which achieved an AUC of 0.78(95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier-score 0.26) and 0.80(95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier-score 0.17) respectively.

We identified that SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Brazil with mutations of concern in the RBD independently acquired convergent deletions and insertions in the NTD of the S protein, which altered the NTD antigenic-supersite and other predicted epitopes at this region.

181,Diagnostic accuracy of rapid antigen tests in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts of individuals with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundPre-/asymptomatic close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were tested at day 5 after contact by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Diagnostic accuracy of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts was up till now unknown.

MethodsWe performed a prospective cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy study. Close contacts (e.g. selected via the test-and-trace program or contact tracing app) aged [&ge;]16 years and asymptomatic when requesting a test, were included consecutively and tested at day 5 at four Dutch public health service test sites. We evaluated two Ag-RDTs (BD Veritor System Ag-RDT (BD), and Roche/SD Biosensor Ag-RDT (SD-B)) with RT-PCR as the reference standard. Virus culture was performed in RT-PCR positive individuals to determine the viral load cut-off above which 95% was culture positive, as a proxy of infectiousness.

ResultsOf 2,678 BD-tested individuals, 233 (8.7%) were RT-PCR positive and BD detected 149 (sensitivity 63.9%; 95% confidence interval 57.4%-70.1%). Out of 1,596 SD-B-tested individuals, 132 (8.3%) were RT-PCR positive and SD-B detected 83 (sensitivity 62.9%; 54.0%-71.1%). When applying an infectiousness viral load cut-off [&ge;] 5.2 log10 gene copies/mL, the sensitivity was 90.1% (84.2%-94.4%) for BD, 86.8% (78.1% to 93.0%) for SD-B overall, and 88.1% (80.5%-93.5%) for BD, 85.1% (74.3%-92.6%) for SD-B for those still asymptomatic at the actual time of sampling. Specificity was >99% for both Ag-RDTs in all analyses.

ConclusionsThe sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 of both Ag-RDTs in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts is over 60%, increasing to over 85% after applying an infectiousness viral load cut-off.

182,Generation of Inhibitory Autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 in Coronavirus Disease 2019,"ObjectivesIt has recently been shown that von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimers may be a key driver of immunothrombosis in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of autoreactivity, the present study investigates, whether the generation of autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 contributes to this finding.

DesignObservational prospective controlled multicenter study.

SettingBlood samples and clinical data of patients with COVID-19 were collected regularly during hospitalization in the period from April to November 2020.

Patients90 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls participated in this study.

Measuerements and Main ResultsAntibodies to ADAMTS13 occurred in 31 (34.4%) patients with COVID-19. Generation of ADAMTS13 antibodies was associated with a significantly lower ADAMTS13 activity (56.5%, interquartile range (IQR) 21.25 vs. 71.5%, IQR 24.25, p=0.0041), increased disease severity (severe or critical disease in 90% vs. 62.3%, p=0.0189), and a trend to a higher mortality (35.5% vs. 18.6%, p=0.0773). Median time to antibody development was 11 days after first positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR specimen.

ConclusionThe present study demonstrates for the first time, that generation of antibodies to ADAMTS13 is a frequent finding in COVID-19. Generation of these antibodies is associated with a lower ADAMTS13 activity and an increased risk of an adverse course of the disease suggesting an inhibitory effect on the protease. These findings provide a rationale to include ADAMTS13 antibodies in the diagnostic workup of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",Adrian Atilla Nicolas Doevelaar; Martin Bachmann; Bodo Hoelzer; Felix Sebastian Seibert; Benjamin Johannes Rohn; Oliver Witzke; Ulf Dittmer; Thorsten Brenner; Krystallenia Paniskaki; Serap Yilmaz; Rita Dittmer; Sonja Schneppenheim; Nina Babel; Ulrich Budde; Timm Henning Westhoff,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253869,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253869,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
183,"COVID-19 collateral damage: psychological distress and behavioral changes among older adults during the first outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden","IntroductionDuring the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swedish public health authorities provided recommendations for 70+ year old people. They were strongly encouraged to self-isolate but remain physically active in a safe manner. This study aimed to explore the indirect, negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions (collateral damage) by exploring to what extent adherence to such recommendations might have impacted the lives and health of older adults living in central Stockholm.

MethodsAn ad-hoc phone questionnaire was administered by trained staff between May and June 2020 to a random sample of older adults 68+ years old (n=1231), who had attended the regular follow-up assessment of the longitudinal Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) during 2016-2019. We explored three dimensions of collateral damage, namely psychological distress (feelings of worry, stress and loneliness), reductions in social and physical activities, and reductions in medical and social care use. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between age, sex, education and living arrangement, and the risk of collateral damage.

ResultsVast majority of participants adhered to the recommendations, with over three quarters practicing self-isolation (n=928). Half of the sample reported psychological distress, 55.3% reported reductions in social or physical activity, and 11.3% reported decreased medical or social care use. Over three quarters of participants were affected by at least one of the three collateral damage dimensions. Female sex was the strongest sociodemographic predictor of individual as well as co-occurring dimensions of collateral damage.

ConclusionCOVID-19 and its restrictions during the first half of 2020 have had a negative effect on the health and lives of a majority of elderly living in central Stockholm. Women were at a particularly higher risk of these negative consequences. We emphasize the need for predefined, evidence-based interventions to address these negative consequences.

184,Serological response to COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients receiving biologics,"ObjectiveThe impact of medications on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in IBD patients is unknown, as patients with immunosuppressed states and/or treated with immunosuppressants were excluded from vaccine trials. To address this, we evaluated serological responses to COVID-19 vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (NIH-Moderna) vaccines in IBD patients enrolled in an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sero-survey at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

DesignWe obtained sera from 48 patients who had undergone vaccination with one or two vaccine doses. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and IgG (Siemens COV2T and sCOVG assays), anti-Spike IgG (in-house ELISA), and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (Roche).

ResultsAll IBD patients (15/15) who completed two-dose vaccine schedules achieved seroconversion to high levels. Two IBD patients with history of COVID-19 infections and who were seropositive at baseline seroconverted to high levels after the first dose. Concurrent biologic use was 85% (41/48), including 33% of patients (16) on TNF antagonist monotherapy, 42% (17) on vedolizumab monotherapy, 6% (3) on vedolizumab combination therapy with thiopurine, and 8% (4) ustekinumab; 1 patient was receiving guselkumab for psoriasis. Three patients (6%) were on oral steroids at the time of vaccination.

ConclusionIBD patients receiving biologics can seroconvert with robust serological responses after complete Pfizer-BioNTech and NIH-Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. In IBD-patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, a single dose of either vaccine can induce high index values, mirroring findings from the general population.",Serre-Yu Wong; Rebekah Dixon; Vicky Martinez Pazos; - ICARUS-IBD; Sacha Gnjatic; Jean-Frederic Colombel; Ken Cadwell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253848,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253848,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
185,COVID-19 Neuropathology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital,"Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop neurological signs and symptoms, though, to date, little evidence exists that primary infection of the brain is a significant contributing factor. We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74 years (38-97 years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24 hours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4 weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.",Kiran Thakur; Emily H Miller; Michael D Glendinning; Osama Al Dalahmah; Matei Banu; Amelia K Boehme; Alex Boubour; Samuel Bruce; Alexander M Chong; Jan Claassen; Phyllis Faust; Gunnar Hargus; Richard Hickman; Sachin Jambawalikar; Alexander Khandji; Carla Kim; Robyn S Klein; Angela Lignelli-Dipple; Chun-Chieh Lin; Yang Liu; Michael Miller; Gul Moonis; Anna Nordvig; Jonathan Overdevest; Morgan Prust; Serge Przedborski; William Roth; Allison Soung; Kurenai Tanji; Andrew Teich; Dritan Agalliu; Anne-Catrin Uhlemann; James E.

188,Exploring causal relationships between COVID-19 and cardiometabolic disorders: A bi-directional Mendelian randomization study,"BackgroundMore than 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. A number of risk factors for infection or severe infection have been identified, however observational studies were subject to confounding bias. In addition, there is still limited knowledge about the complications or medical consequences of the disease.

MethodsHere we performed bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate causal relationships between liability to COVID-19 (and severe/critical infection) and a wide range of around 30 cardiometabolic disorders (CMD) or traits. Genetic correlation (rg) was assessed by LD score regression(LDSC). The latest GWAS summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative was used, which comprised comparisons of general population controls with critically ill, hospitalized and any infected cases.

ResultsOverall we observed evidence that liability to COVID-19 or severe infection may be causally associated with higher risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM), chronic kidney disease(CKD), ischemic stroke (especially large artery stroke[LAS]) and heart failure(HF) when compared to the general population. On the other hand, our findings suggested that liability to atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke (especially LAS), obesity, diabetes (T1DM and T2DM), low insulin sensitivity and impaired renal function (low eGFR and diabetic kidney disease) may be causal risk factors for COVID-19 or severe disease. In genetic correlation analysis, T2DM, CAD, obesity, fasting insulin, CKD, gout, stroke and urate showed positive rg with critical or hospitalized infection. All above findings passed multiple testing correction at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05.

ConclusionsIn summary, this study provides evidence for tentative bi-directional causal associations between liability to COVID-19 and severe disease and a number of CM disorders.

We measured antibody-mediated neutralization of spike protein-ACE2 receptor binding--a surrogate measure of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection--in a large and diverse community-based seroprevalence study. Comparisons were made across three groups of seropositive participants that differed in the severity of infection and engagement with clinical care (N=790). The clinical group was seropositive for prior infection, symptomatic, and diagnosed with COVID-19 by a healthcare provider. The symptomatic group was seropositive and reported one or more symptoms of infection but received no clinical care. The asymptomatic group was seropositive but reported no symptoms. 86.2% of all infections were mild or asymptomatic; 13.8% received clinical care. Of the clinical cases, 96.3% were outpatient; only 3.7% required hospitalization. Moderate or high levels of neutralizing activity were detected following 27.5% of clinical infections, in comparison with 5.4% of symptomatic and 1.5% of asymptomatic infections. The majority of infections in the general population are mild or asymptomatic and likely result in low levels of antibody-mediated protective immunity.",Thomas W. McDade; Amelia Sancilio; Richard T.

190,Heterogeneous immunological recovery trajectories revealed in post-acute COVID-19,"The immunological picture of how different patients recover from COVID-19, and how those recovery trajectories are influenced by infection severity, remain unclear. We investigated 140 COVID-19 patients from diagnosis to convalescence using clinical data, viral load assessments, and multi-omic analyses of blood plasma and circulating immune cells. Immune-phenotype dynamics resolved four recovery trajectories.

191,Analysis of Thrombotic Adverse Reactions of COVID-19 AstraZeneca Vaccine reported to EudraVigilance database,"The development of safe, effective, affordable vaccines against COVID-19 remains the cornerstone to mitigating this pandemic. Early December 2020, multiple research groups had designed potential vaccines. From 11 March 2021, several European countries temporarily suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine amid reports of blood clot events and death of a vaccinated person, despite the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization assurance that there was no indication that vaccination was linked. This study aimed to identify and analyse the thrombotic adverse reactions associated with Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. This was a retrospective descriptive study using spontaneous reports submitted to the EudraVigilance database in the period from 17 February to 12 March 2021. There were 54,571 adverse reaction reports of which 28 were associated with thrombotic adverse reactions. Three fatalities were related to Pulmonary Embolism; 1 fatality to Thrombosis. With 17 million people having had the AstraZeneca vaccine, these are extremely rare events. The EMAs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (18 March 2021) concluded that the vaccine was safe, effective and the benefits outweighed the risks. Conducting further analyses based on more detailed thrombotic adverse event reports, including patients characteristics and comorbidities, may enable assessment of the causality with higher specificity.",Mansour Tobaiqy; Hajer Elkout; Katie MacLure,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253980,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253980,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
192,"COVID-19 IN IRAQ, THE RURAL INITIATION (AL-MUTHANNA PROVINCE AS AN EXAMPLE)","A sustained pneumonia outbreak associated with a novel coronavirus named acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 which was later called COVID-19. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Najaf/ Iraq on 24th February. This paper provided some information on COVID-19 infection in the Province of Al-Muthanna / South Iraq, which was then statistically analyzed and concluded. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections were reported by the Iraqi Ministry of Health in the Province of Al-Muthanna. The first foci started and the first dead infected individual was from Hilal which refers mainly to the role or rural places in starting and transmission of COVID-19 in Iraq. Many of the infections resulted in non-traveling persons because they were contaminated by contact (96%). Therefore, contact is perceived to be the best-recognized form of transmission. It was also reported that infections in Soweir District of Samawah City were the highest (45%) compared to other areas of the region. They should also be observed, however, that the steps to enforce and monitor the curfew are directly related to the direction of the City Centre, because the more they drive away from the city centers, the less stringent the procedures. Infections were focused between the ages of 20 and 50 years old, as that is the expected result, because these ranges are at the core of active age groups including social and sports events.

193,Evaluation of serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers who participated in the operation of charter flights for the evacuation of Japanese residents from Hubei Province,"There are several recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the selection of appropriate PPE for the current situation remains controversial. We measured serum antibody titers for SARS-CoV-2 in 10 participants who were engaged in the operation of charter flights for the evacuation of Japanese residents from Hubei Province. All participants wore PPE in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. A total of 17 samples were tested, and all were seronegative.

194,SARS-CoV-2 show no infectivity at later stages in a prolonged COVID-19 patient despite positivity in RNA testing,"Inpatient COVID-19 cases present enormous costs to patients and health systems. Many hospitalized patients may still test COVID-19 positive, even after resolution of symptoms. Thus, a pressing concern for clinicians is the safety of discharging these asymptomatic patients if they have any remaining infectivity. This case report explores the viral viability in a patient with persistent COVID-19 over the course of a two-month hospitalization. Positive nasopharyngeal swab samples, analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), were collected and isolated in the laboratory, and infectious doses were analyzed throughout the hospitalization period. The patient experienced waning symptoms by hospital day 40 and had no viable virus growth in the laboratory by hospital day 41, suggesting no risk of infectivity, despite positive RT-PCR results, which prolonged his hospital stay. Notably, this case showed infectivity for at least 24 days from disease onset, which is longer than the discontinuation of transmission-based precautions recommendation by CDC. Thus, our findings suggest that the timeline for discontinuing transmission-based precautions may need to be extended for patients with prolonged illness. Additional large-scale studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions on the appropriate clinical management for these patients.",Xiu-Feng Wan; Cynthia Y Tang; Detlef Ritter; Yang Wang; Tao Li; Karen Segovia; Martina Kosikova; Marc Johnson; Hyung Joon Kwon; Hang Xie; Richard D Hammer; Jane A McElroy; Aws Hamid; Natalie D Collins; Jun Hang; Simone Camp,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253228,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253228,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
195,Targeted Hybridization Capture of SARS-CoV-2 and Metagenomics Enables Genetic Variant Discovery and Nasal Microbiome Insights,"The emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants that may alter viral fitness highlights the urgency of widespread next-generation sequencing (NGS) surveillance. To profile genetic variants, we developed and clinically validated a hybridization capture SARS-CoV-2 NGS assay, integrating novel methods for panel design using dsDNA biotin-labeled probes, and built accompanying software. The positive and negative percent agreement were defined in comparison to an orthogonal RT-PCR assay (PPA and NPA: both 96.7%). The limit of detection was established to be 800 copies/ml with an average fold-enrichment of 46,791x. We identified novel 107 mutations, including 24 in the functionally-important spike protein. Further, we profiled the full nasopharyngeal microbiome using metagenomics and found overrepresentation of 7 taxa and macrolide resistance in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. This hybrid capture NGS assay, coupled with optimized software, is a powerful approach to detect and comprehensively map SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants for tracking viral evolution and guiding vaccine updates.

196,Collaborative Cohort of Cohorts for COVID-19 Research (C4R) Study: Study Design,"The Collaborative Cohort of Cohorts for COVID-19 Research (C4R) is a national prospective study of adults at risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) comprising 14 established United States (US) prospective cohort studies. For decades, C4R cohorts have collected extensive data on clinical and subclinical diseases and their risk factors, including behavior, cognition, biomarkers, and social determinants of health. C4R will link this pre-COVID phenotyping to information on SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute and post-acute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and broadly reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the US. C4R is ascertaining severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations, and high-quality events surveillance. Extensive pre-pandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are being harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings.

197,Data-driven estimate of SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity threshold in populations with individual contact pattern variations,"The development of efficacious vaccines has made it possible to envision mass vaccination programs aimed at suppressing SARS-CoV-2 transmission around the world. Here we use a data-driven age-structured multilayer representation of the population of 34 countries to estimate the disease induced immunity threshold, accounting for the contact variability across individuals. We show that the herd immunization threshold of random (un-prioritized) mass vaccination programs is generally larger than the disease induced immunity threshold. We use the model to test two additional vaccine prioritization strategies, transmission-focused and age-based, in which individuals are inoculated either according to their behavior (number of contacts) or infection fatality risk, respectively. Our results show that in the case of a sterilizing vaccine the behavioral strategy achieves herd-immunity at a coverage comparable to the disease-induced immunity threshold, but it appears to have inferior performance in averting deaths than the risk vaccination strategy. The presented results have potential use in defining the effects that the heterogeneity of social mixing and contact patterns has on herd immunity levels and the deployment of vaccine prioritization strategies.",Dan Lu; Alberto Aleta; Marco Ajelli; Romualdo Pastor-Satorras; Alessandro Vespignani; Yamir Moreno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253974,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253974,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
198,A convergence based assessment of relative differences in age-stratified susceptibility and infectiousness for SARS-CoV-2 variants of B.1.1.7 lineage,"We propose (a) a method for aggregating and processing age-stratified subregional time series data for positive tests of infection given partial sampling for variant-of-concern biomarkers, and (b) a simple model-based theoretical framework for interpreting these processed data, to assess whether observed heterogeneity in age-specific relative differences can be explained by environmental effects alone.

We then apply this strategy to public-domain subregional time series data with S-gene target failure (SGTF) sampling as a proxy for B.1.1.7 lineage, from weeks 45 to 50 of 2020 from England. For the time period in question, we observe convergence toward a 1.27 (95% CI 1.17-1.38) times higher ratio of SGTF to non-SGTF infection for 0-9-year-olds than for the total population, and a 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.23) times higher ratio for 10-19-year-olds. These are roughly comparable to previous findings, but this time we find high-significance evidence for adequate compatibility with our proposed modelling framework criteria to conclude that these relative elevations for 0-19-year-olds are very unlikely to be explained by environmental effects alone. We also find possible indications that 0-19-year-olds might experience a higher relative increase in infectiousness than susceptibility for B.1.1.7.",Sarah Dean Rasmussen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253931,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253931,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
199,Prevalence and determinants of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the general population of the Gardena Valley,"BackgroundCommunity-based studies are essential to quantify the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and for unbiased characterization of its determinants and outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Gardena valley, a major Alpine touristic destination which was struck in the expansion phase of the COVID-19 pandemic over the winter 2020.

MethodsWe surveyed 2244 representative study participants who underwent swab and serum antibody tests. We made multiple comparisons among the Abbott and Diasorin bioassays and serum neutralization titers. Seroprevalence accounted for the stratified design, non-response and test accuracy. Determinants and symptoms predictive of infection were analyzed by weighted multiple logistic regression.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 26.9% (95% confidence interval: 25.2%, 28.6%) by June 2020. The serum antibody bioassays had modest agreement with each other. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the serum neutralizing capacity showed better performance of the Abbott test at lower than the canonical threshold. Socio-demographic characteristics showed no clear evidence of association with seropositivity, which was instead associated with place of residence and economic activity. Loss of taste or smell, fever, difficulty in breathing, pain in the limbs, and weakness were the most predictive symptoms of positive antibody test results. Fever and weakness associations were age-dependent.

ConclusionThe Gardena valley had one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in Europe.

200,Accuracy of Computable Phenotyping Approaches for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Hospitalizations from the Electronic Health Record,"ObjectiveReal-world data, including administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data, have been critical for rapid-knowledge generation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Many studies relied on these data to identify cases and ascertain outcomes., commonly using diagnostic codes. However, to ensure high-quality results are delivered to guide clinical decision making, guide the public health response, and characterize the response to interventions, it is essential to establish the accuracy of these approaches for case identification of infections and hospitalizations.

MethodsReal-world EHR data were obtained from the clinical data warehouse and computational health platform at a large academic health system that includes 5 regional hospitals in Connecticut and Rhode Island and their associated ambulatory practices. Demographic information, diagnosis codes, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and antigen testing results, and visit data including discharge disposition were obtained from our OMOP common data model for all patients with either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or ICD-10 diagnosis of COVID-19 (U07.1) between April 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021. Various computable phenotype definitions using combinations of test results and diagnostic codes were evaluated for their accuracy to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalizations. The association with each phenotype was further compared with case volumes and, for hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality. We conducted a quantitative assessment with a manual chart review for a sample of 40 patients who had discordance between diagnostic code and laboratory result findings.

ResultsThere were 69,423 individuals with either a diagnosis code or a laboratory diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 61,023 individuals had a principal or a secondary diagnosis code for COVID-19 and 50,355 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test. Among those with a positive PCR, 38,506 (76.5%) also had a principal and 3449 (6.8%) a secondary diagnosis of COVID-19, but 8400 (16.7%) had no COVID-19 diagnosis in the medical record. Moreover, of the 61,023 patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis, 19,068 (31.2%) did not have a positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 in the EHR. In a manual chart review of this sample of patients, we found that these many had a COVID-19 diagnosis code added during healthcare encounters related to asymptomatic testing, either as part of a screening program or following exposure, but with negative subsequent test results. The positive predictive value (precision) and sensitivity (recall) of a COVID-19 diagnosis in the medical record for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were 68.8% and 83.3%, respectively. Further, among 5,109 patients who were hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of COVID-19, 4843 (94.8%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test within the 2 weeks preceding hospital admission or during hospitalization. In a random sample of 10 without a positive test during the index hospitalization selected for manual chart review, 7 (70.0%) had been tested at an outside laboratory before admission and the remaining had a strong clinical suspicion for COVID-19. In addition, 789 hospitalizations had a secondary diagnosis of COVID-19, of which 446 (56.5%) had a principal diagnosis that was consistent with severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 (e.g., sepsis or respiratory failure). Compared with the cohort that had a principal diagnosis of COVID-19, those with a secondary diagnosis more frequently male and White and had more than 2-fold higher in-hospital mortality (13.2% vs 28.0%, P<0.001).

ConclusionsIn a large integrated health system, COVID-19 diagnosis codes were not adequate for case identification and epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, a principal diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis consistently identified hospitalized patients with the disease but missed nearly 10% of cases that presented with more severe manifestations of disease and had over 2-fold higher mortality. Data from the EHR can provide additional data elements compared to administrative claims alone, such as laboratory testing results, that can be used to in conjunction with diagnostic codes to create more fine-tuned phenotypes that are designed for specific analytical use cases.",Rohan Khera; Bobak Mortazavi; Veer Sangha; Frederick Warner; H Patrick Young; Joseph S Ross; Nilay D Shah; Benjamin D Pollock; Karen Wang; Cynthia A Brandt; Zhenqiu Lin; Harlan M Krumholz; Wade L Schulz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253770,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253770,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
201,Adapting French COVID-19 vaccination campaign duration to variant dissemination,"BackgroundThe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a major international health crisis with serious consequences in terms of public health and economy. In France, two lockdown periods were decided in 2020 to avoid the saturation of intensive care units (ICU) and an increase in mortality. The rapid dissemination of variant SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 has strongly influenced the course of the epidemic. Vaccines have been rapidly developed. Their efficacy against the severe forms of the disease has been established, and their efficacy against disease transmission is under evaluation. The aim of this paper is to compare the efficacy of several vaccination strategies in the presence of variants in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic through population immunity.

MethodsAn agent-based model was designed to simulate with different scenarios the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in France over 2021 and 2022. The simulations were carried out ignoring the occurrence of variants then taking into account their diffusion over time. The expected effects of three Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (Relaxed-NPI, Intensive-NPI, and Extended-NPI) to limit the epidemic extension were compared. The expected efficacy of vaccines were the values recently estimated in preventing severe forms of the disease (75% and 94%) for the current used vaccines in France (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna since January 11, 2021, and AstraZeneca since February 2, 2021). All vaccination campaigns reproduced an advanced age-based priority advised by the Haute Autorite de Sante. Putative reductions of virus transmission were fixed at 0, 50, 75 and 90%. The effects of four vaccination campaign durations (6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month) were compared.

ResultsIn the absence of vaccination, the presence of variants led to reject the Relaxed-NPI because of a high expected number of deaths (170 to 210 thousands) and the significant overload of ICUs from which 35 thousand patients would be deprived. In comparison with the situation without vaccination, the number of deaths was divided by 7 without ICU saturation with a 6-month vaccination campaign. A 12-month campaign would divide the number of death by 3 with Intensive-NPI and by 6 with Extended-NPI (the latter being necessary to avoid ICU saturation). With 18-month and 24-month vaccination campaigns without Extended-NPI, the number of deaths and ICU admissions would explode.

ConclusionAmong the four compared strategies the 6-month vaccination campaign seems to be the best response to changes in the dynamics of the epidemic due to the variants. The race against the COVID-19 epidemic is a race of vaccination strategy. Any further vaccination delay would increase the need of strengthened measures such as Extended-NPI to limit the number of deaths and avoid ICU saturation.",Simon Pageaud; Nicolas Ponthus; Romain Gauchon; Catherine Pothier; Christophe Rigotti; Anne Eyraud-Loisel; Jean-Pierre Bertoglio; Alexis Bienven&uumle; Fran&ccedilois Gueyffier; Philippe Vanhems; Nicolas Leboisne; Jean Iwaz; St&eacutephane Loisel; Pascal Roy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253739,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253739,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
202,Modelling the population-level protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccination,"Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines work predominantly by eliciting neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), how the protection they confer depends on the NAb response to vaccination is unclear. Here, we collated and analysed in vitro dose-response curves of >70 NAbs and constructed a landscape defining the spectrum of neutralization efficiencies of NAbs elicited. We mimicked responses of individuals by sampling NAb subsets of known sizes from the landscape and found that they recapitulated responses of convalescent patients. Combining individual responses with a mathematical model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination, we predicted how the population-level protection conferred would increase with the NAb response to vaccination. Our predictions captured the outcomes of vaccination trials. Our formalism may help optimize vaccination protocols, given limited vaccine availability.

203,Investigation of the ventilation situation in a lecture room of building 033 at the Universität der Bundeswehr München,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is limiting both the private and public lives of many people around the world. It is now considered certain that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets, smear infection, and aerosol particles. While simple masks, spacing, and hand hygiene significantly reduce the risk of infection via the first two routes mentioned, the risk from aerosol particles remains. These small particles move with the air in the room and spread unhindered throughout it. To reduce the risk of infection from viruses present in aerosol particles, the following options exist. First, good respiratory masks can be worn to reduce the viral load in the inhaled air. Another option is to make the viruses harmless (e.g., by UV light). A third option is to reduce the viral load in the room by bringing in virus-free air and moving contaminated air out or cleaning the air in the room. To investigate how well virus load reduction via ventilation works in a real lecture room, measurements were carried out at the Universitat der Bundeswehr Munchen (University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich). The lecture room holds a maximum of approx. 90 people and has a ventilation system as well as 2 windows that can be opened. In the absence of a ventilation system in a comparable room, the effectiveness of a room air cleaner was also investigated.",Christian J.

204,Return to normal: COVID-19 vaccination under mitigation measures,"Being unable to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the majority of countries worldwide have resorted to a mitigation approach towards COVID-19, allowing some degree of viral circulation in the population. Here, we investigate the expected outcomes of the interplay between vaccination rollout and adaptive mitigation measures constantly altering the epidemic trajectory and keeping the reproduction number around the unit. Using a novel mathematical modeling framework, we estimate that, for vaccination capacities of at least 4 daily doses administered per 1,000 inhabitants, a complete release of mitigation measures can be expected within 7 to 13 months since the start of vaccination, with a two-year cumulative incidence of deaths between 0.18 and 0.46 per 1,000 population. A heavier burden of deaths and a delayed ""return-to-normal"" is expected for lower vaccine capacities, if viral transmissibility exceeds by >60% the one estimated at the beginning of the pandemic, or if vaccine protection is short-lived. Failure to prioritize the elderly or a premature release of mitigation measures after vaccination of the most fragile will conspicuously increase the expected mortality. Finally, strategies oriented to prioritize the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 by maintaining strict restrictions will take a similar time as a mitigation approach, possibly resulting in acceptability issues.

205,Factors Associated with Intention to Vaccinate against COVID-19 in Puerto Rico,"COVID-19 has been particularly devastating to Black and Latinx communities in the U.S. However, data on acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccines among minority populations are limited. We conducted an online survey among adults in Puerto Rico to identify factors associated with intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. Sociodemographic variables were analyzed independently for association with intention to vaccinate. Significant associations were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 1016 responses were available for analysis. In the bivariate analysis, younger age, higher education, pre-covid employment, male sex, gay/bisexual identity, and single marital status were associated with increased intention to vaccinate. In the multivariate logistic regression, younger, male respondents who had higher educational attainment reported higher intention to vaccinate. Lower-income and living outside the San Juan metro region were associated with lower intention to vaccinate. National and international health organizations were identified as the most reliable sources of information, followed by healthcare professionals. These findings highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic characteristics identified with low intention to vaccinate as well as using trusted sources of information when designing public messaging related to increasing COVID-19 vaccinations.",Kyle Melin; Cheyu Zhang; Juan Pablo Zapata; Yonaira Maria Rivera; Enbal Shacham; Souhail Marie Malave-Rivera; Carlos E Rodriguez-Diaz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253972,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253972,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
206,"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a mathematical modelling analysis","The worldwide endeavour to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has been extraordinary, and vaccination is now underway in many countries. However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extended a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identified optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We found that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for <20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.

HighlightsO_LIThe global dose supply of COVID-19 vaccines will be constrained in 2021
C_LIO_LIWithin a country, prioritising doses to protect those at highest mortality risk is efficient

207,Risk of reinfection after seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2: A population-based propensity-score matched cohort study,"ImportanceSerological assays detecting specific IgG antibodies generated against the Spike protein following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are being widely deployed in research studies and clinical practice. However, the duration and the effectiveness of the protection conferred by the immune response against future infection remains to be assessed in a large population.

ObjectiveTo estimate the incidence of newly acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in seropositive individuals from a population-based sample as compared to seronegative controls.

DesignRetrospective longitudinal propensity-score matched cohort study.

SettingA seroprevalence survey including a population-based representative sample of the population from the canton of Geneva (Switzerland) was conducted between April and June 2020, immediately after the first pandemic wave. Each individual included in the seroprevalence survey was linked to a state centralized registry compiling virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections since the beginning of the pandemic.

ParticipantsParticipants aged twelve years old and over, who developed anti-spike IgG antibodies were matched one-to-two to seronegative controls, using a propensity-score including age, gender, immunodeficiency, body mass index, smoking status and education level.

ExposureSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.

Main outcomes and measuresOur primary outcome was virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections which occurred from serological status assessment in April-June 2020 to the end of the second pandemic wave (January 2021). Additionally, incidence of infections, rate of testing and proportion of positive tests were analysed.

ResultsAmong 8344 serosurvey participants, 498 seropositive individuals were selected and matched with 996 seronegative controls. After a mean follow-up of 35.6 (Standard Deviation, SD: 3.2) weeks, 7 out of 498 (1.4%) seropositive subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, of which 5 (1.0%) were considered as reinfections. By contrast, infection rate was significantly higher in seronegative individuals (15.5%, 154/996) during a similar mean follow-up of 34.7 (SD 3.2) weeks, corresponding to a 94% (95%CI 86% to 98%, P<0.001) reduction in the hazard of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for seropositive subjects.

Conclusions and relevanceSeroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection to successive viral contamination lasting at least 8 months. These findings could help global health authorities establishing priority for vaccine allocation.

Key points

QuestionDo SARS-CoV-2 antibodies confer protection against future infection?

FindingsIn this retrospective matched cohort study nested in a representative sample of the general population of Geneva, Switzerland, we observed a 94% reduction in the hazard of being infected among participants with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, when compared to seronegative controls, >8 months after initial serology assessment.

208,"Modelling the impact of rapid tests, tracing and distancing in lower-income countries suggest optimal policies varies with rural-urban settings","BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) remains the most reliable COVID-19 containment tool for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) given the inequality of vaccine distribution and their vulnerable healthcare systems. We aimed to develop mathematical models that capture LMIC demographic characteristics such as young population and large household size and assess NPI effectiveness in rural and urban communities.

MethodsWe constructed synthetic populations for rural, non-slum urban and slum settings to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. We integrated age mixing and household structure into contact networks for each community setting and simulated COVID-19 outbreaks within the networks. Using this agent-based model, we evaluate NPIs including testing and isolation, tracing and quarantine, and physical distancing. We explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic test, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. We performed extensive simulations to capture the uncertainty of outbreak trajectories and the impact of varying model parameters.

FindingsWe found the impact of testing, tracing and distancing varies with rural-urban settings. In rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. Additionally, antibody rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based diagnosis could be useful for mitigating the transmission. In non-slum urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In slum communities, we found physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and non-slum urban communities. Lastly, for all communities considered, we demonstrated contact quarantine is essential for effective containment and is effective at a low compliance rate (30%).

InterpretationOur findings could guide setting-specific strategy design for different communities in LMICs. Our assessments also have implications on applying rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based diagnosis for case finding, tracing and distancing in lower-income communities.",Xilin Jiang; Wenfeng Gong; Ya Gao; Christophe Fraser; Chris Holmes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253853,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253853,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
209,"Importation, circulation, and emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the South Indian State of Karnataka","As the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 continues, the selection of genomic variants which can influence how the pandemic progresses is of growing concern. Of particular concern, are those variants that carry mutations/amino acid changes conferring higher transmission, more severe disease, re-infection, and immune escape. These can broadly be classified as Variants of Concern (VOCs). VOCs have been reported from several parts of the world- UK (lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (lineage B.1.351) and, Brazil (lineage P.1/B.1.1.28). The conditions that contribute to the emergence of VOCs are not well understood. International travel remains an important means of spread. To track importation, spread, and the emergence of variants locally; we sequenced whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from international travellers (n=75) entering Karnataka, a state in South India, between Dec 22, 2020- Jan 31, 2021, and from positive cases in the city of Bengaluru (n=108), between Nov 22, 2020- Jan 22, 2021. The resulting 176 SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be classified into 34 lineages, that were either imported (73/176) or circulating (103/176) in this time period. The lineage B.1.1.7 (a.k.a the UK variant) was the major lineage imported into the state (24/73, 32.9%), followed by B.1.36 (20/73, 27.4%) and B.1 (14/73, 19.2%). We identified B.1.36 (45/103; 43.7%), B.1 (26/103; 25.2%), B.1.1.74 (5/103; 4.9%) and B.1.468 (4/103; 3.9%) as the major variants circulating in Bengaluru city. A distinct clade within the B.1.36 lineage was associated with a local outbreak. Analysis of the complete genomes predicted multiple amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. In total, we identified nine amino acid changes (singly or in pairs) in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike protein. Of these, the amino acid replacement N440K was found in 37/65 (56.92%) sequences in the B.1.36 lineage. The E484K amino acid change which is present in both VOCs, B.1.351 and P.1/B.1.1.28, was found in a single circulating virus in the B.1.36 lineage. This study highlights the introduction of VOCs by travel and the local circulation of viruses with amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. These were spread across lineages, suggesting that multiple paths can lead to the emergence of VOCs, this, in turn, highlights the need to sequence and limit outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 locally.

210,Effect of information about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and side effects on behavioural intentions: two online experiments,"The success of mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns rests on widespread uptake. However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication--including uncertainty--about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2,097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2,217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g. social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.",John R.

211,"Neurological manifestations of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 attending a public hospital in Lima, Peru","ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence and characteristics of the most common neurological manifestations in Peruvian patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a single-center prospective, cross-sectional study at an isolation center functioning as a public acute-care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lima, the capital city of Peru. This was a convenience sample of patients with acute COVID-19 infection and mild-to-moderate respiratory symptoms who presented for hospital admission between September 25 and November 25, 2020. We interviewed participants and collected demographic, medical history and clinical presentation data; all participants underwent a complete physical and neurological examination. Descriptive statistics and prevalence ratios (PR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values were calculated to explore between-groups differences.

ResultsOf 199 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 enrolled in this study, 83% presented with at least one neurological symptom (mean symptom duration 8 +/-6 days). The most common neurological symptoms were headache (72%), hypogeusia or ageusia (41%), hyposmia or anosmia (40%) and dizziness (34%). Only 2.5% of the cohort had an abnormal neurological examination. The majority (42%) had no prior comorbidities. Presence of at least 1 neurological symptom was independently associated with fever, dyspnea, cough, poor appetite, sore throat, chest tightness or diarrhea, but not with comorbid conditions.

ConclusionsThis cross-sectional study found that headaches, and smell and taste dysfunction are common among patients presenting with mild-to-moderate acute COVID-19 in Lima, Peru.

212,The effect of Covid-19 isolation measures on the cognition and mental health of people living with dementia: a rapid systematic review of one year of evidence.,"BackgroundCovid-19 control policies have entailed lockdowns and confinement. Although these isolation measures are thought to be particularly hard and possibly harmful to people with dementia, their specific impact during the pandemic has not yet been synthesised. We aimed to examine and summarise the global research evidence describing the effect of Covid-19 isolation measures on the health of people living with dementia.

MethodWe searched Pubmed, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to February 2021 for peer-reviewed quantitative studies of the effects of isolation measures during Covid-19 on cognitive, psychological and functional symptoms of people with any kind of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. We summarised the findings of included papers following current guidelines for rapid reviews.

ResultsWe identified 15 eligible papers, examining a total of 6,442 people with dementia. 13/15 were conducted in people living in the community and 2 in care homes. 60% (9/15) studies reported changes in cognition with 77% (7/9) of them describing declined cognition by >50% of respondents. 93% (14/15) of studies reported worsening or new onset of behavioural and psychological symptoms. 46% (7/15) studies reported changes in daily function, 6 of them reporting a functional decline in a variable proportion of the population studied.

ConclusionLockdowns and confinement measures brought about by the pandemic have damaged the cognitive and psychological health and functional abilities of people with dementia across the world. It is urgent that infection control measures applied to people with dementia are balanced against the principles of non-maleficence. This systematic review makes 4 specific calls for action.

Key PointsO_LINeuropsychiatric symptoms of people with dementia (e.g., anxiety, depressive symptoms, apathy, agitation) were found to worsen during lockdown in the majority of studies.
C_LIO_LICognitive decline affecting memory, orientation concentration and communication was observed by caregivers within few weeks after lockdown.
C_LIO_LIThe deterioration reported occurred in a short window of time (between 1 and 4 months) and it is unlikely to be attributable to the natural variation of the course of dementia.
C_LIO_LIThere is little research conducted in care home residents with dementia (only 2 papers found).
C_LIO_LIIncrease consumption of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines has occurred in people with dementia during lockdown.
C_LIO_LIEvidence indicates that isolation measures quickly damaged peoples with dementia cognitive and mental health and probably accelerated overall decline.

Immunological, virological, and routine laboratory markers to be used in addition to clinical data are needed.

Aim and methodsBlood tests to measure neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), levels of ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, complement components (C3, C4), lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines, and SARS-Cov2 RT-PCR tests were performed in COVID-19 confirmed cases within 48 hours of admission. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined by RT-PCR from oral or nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of admission. Severity of symptoms was categorized as mild (grade 1), severe (grade 2), and critical (grade 3).

Results120 patients were included. COVID-19 was mild in 49, severe in 32, and critical in 39. Ferritin >370 ng/mL (OR 16.4, 95% CI 5.3-50.8), D-dimer >440 ng/mL (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36-12.61), CRP >7.65 mg/dL (OR 11.54, 95% CI 4.3-30.8), NLR >3.77 (OR 13.4, 95% CI 4.3-41.1), IL-6 >142.5 pg/mL (OR 8.76, 95% CI 3.56-21.54), IL-10 >10.8 pg/mL (OR 16.45, 95% CI 5.32-50.81), sIL-2r (sCD25) >804.5 pg/mL (OR 14.06, 95% CI 4.56-43.28), IL-1Ra >88.4 pg/mL (OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.03-10.17), and IL-18 >144 pg/mL (OR 17.85, 95% CI 6.54-48.78) were associated with critical COVID-19 in the univariate age-adjusted analysis. In the multivariate age-adjusted analysis, this association was confirmed only for ferritin, CRP,NLR, IL-10, sIL-2r, and IL-18. T, B, and NK cells were significantly decreased in critical patients. SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in blood except in 3 patients with indeterminate results. Ct values determined by RT-PCR from oral/nasopharyngeal swabs on admission were not related to symptom severity.

214,Network-based Modeling of COVID-19 Dynamics: Early Pandemic Spread in India,"Modeling the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic spread is a challenging and relevant problem. Established models for the epidemic spread such as compartmental epidemiological models e.g. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models and its variants, have been discussed extensively in the literature and utilized to forecast the growth of the pandemic across different hot-spots in the world. The standard formulations of SIR models rely upon summary-level data, which may not be able to fully capture the complete dynamics of the pandemic growth. Since the disease spreads from carriers to susceptible individuals via some form of contact, it inherently relies upon a network of individuals for its growth, with edges established via direct interaction, such as shared physical proximity. Using individual-level COVID-19 data from the early days (January 30 to April 15, 2020) of the pandemic in India, and under a network-based SIR model framework, we performed state-specific forecasting under multiple scenarios characterized by the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across 34 Indian states and union territories. We validated our short-term projections using observed case counts and the long-term projections using national sero-survey findings. Based on healthcare availability data, we also performed projections to assess the burdens on the infrastructure along the spectrum of the pandemic growth. We have developed an interactive dashboard summarizing our results. Our predictions successfully identified the initial hot-spots of India such as Maharashtra and Delhi, and those that emerged later, such as Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on surgical procedures in Brazil.

Materials and MethodsWe conducted a descriptive study of the number of hospitalizations for surgical procedures in Brazil from 2016 to 2020. Data were collected from the Brazilian Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS). Analyzes were performed according to the type of procedure, geographical region, subgroups of surgical procedures, and the number of surgeries from 2020 were compared with the average from 2016 to 2019.

ResultsThere were 4,009,116 hospitalizations for surgical procedures in the Brazilian Public Health System in 2020. When comparing it to the average of hospitalizations from 2016-2019, there was a decrease of 14.88% [95%IC (14.82-14.93)]. Decrease rates were 34.82% [95%IC (34.73-34.90)] for elective procedures and 1.11% [95%IC (1.07-1.13)] for urgent procedures. Decrease rates were similar in all the five regions of the country (average 14.17%). Surgical procedure subgroups with the highest decrease rates were endocrine gland surgery (48.03%), breast surgery (40.68%), oral and maxillofacial surgery (37.03%), surgery of the upper airways, face, head and neck (36.06%), and minor surgeries and surgeries of skin, subcutaneous tissue and mucosa (33.16%).

217,Homophily in risk and behavior complicate understanding the COVID-19 epidemic curve,"New COVID-19 diagnoses have dropped faster than expected in the United States. Interpretations of the decrease have focused on changing factors (e.g. mask-wearing, vaccines, etc.), but predictive models largely ignore heterogeneity in behaviorally-driven exposure risks among distinct groups. We present a simplified compartmental model with differential mixing in two behaviorally distinct groups. We show how homophily in behavior, risk, and exposure can lead to early peaks and rapid declines that critically do not signal the end of the outbreak. Instead, higher exposure risk groups may more rapidly exhaust available susceptibles while the lower risk group are still in a (slower) growth phase of their outbreak curve. This simplified model demonstrates that complex incidence curves, such as those currently seen in the US, can be generated without changes to fundamental drivers of disease dynamics.

The impact of these variants on the functioning of healthcare systems requires monitoring the spread of these variants, which are more contagious, more lethal and may reinfect people who are already immune to a natural infection or to a vaccination. Monitoring the viral genome in wastewater has shown great value in early detection of the dynamics of virus spreading in populations.

The sequencing of viral genomes is used in humans, but its application and interpretation on wastewater matrices are much more complex due to the diversity of circulating strains. Also this study demonstrates the possibility of following certain mutations found in these new variants by targeted RT-qPCR. This study is the first carried out in France demonstrating the spreading dynamics of the 69-70 deletion in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.",SEBASTIEN WURTZER; Prunelle Waldman; Morgane Levert; Jeann-Marie Mouchel; Olivier Gorge; Mickael Boni; Yvon Maday; - Obepine consortium; Vincent Marechal; Laurent Moulin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253291,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253291,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
219,Mental health of patients with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: A questionnaire-based survey weighted for attrition,"ImportanceIndividuals with pre-existing mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the negative impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic seems to have on mental health. Most prior studies on this topic are limited by non-random sampling, lacking information on non-respondents, and self-reporting of mental illness. In the present study, we aimed to overcome these limitations via random sampling, acquisition of clinical and sociodemographic data on both respondents and non-respondents, and weighting of results informed by attrition.

ObjectiveTo assess whether patients with mental illness experienced deterioration in mental health during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown of Denmark in the Spring of 2020.

DesignA cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey coupled with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees. The latter enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results.

SettingThe psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region.

ParticipantsA total of 992 randomly drawn patients diagnosed with mental illness in the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region prior to the lockdown responded to the online survey (response rate of 21.6%).

ExposureThe four-week nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 11 to April 15, 2020).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe online questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in symptoms during the lockdown using the pre-pandemic period as reference. Perceived reasons for deterioration of mental health were also reported.

ResultsThe weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 28, respectively. A total of 52% of the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during the lockdown, while 33% reported no change, and 16% reported improvement. The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration were loneliness, disruption of routines, concerns about coronavirus, less frequent contact with family/friends, boredom, and reduced access to psychiatric care.

Conclusion and RelevanceMore than half of the patients with mental illness reported worsening of their mental health during the pandemic lockdown. There should be increased emphasis on ensuring both social and clinical support for individuals with mental illness during pandemics.

220,Intensity of COVID-19 in care homes following Hospital Discharge in the early stages of the UK epidemic,"BackgroundA defining feature of the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries was the tragic extent to which care home residents were affected, and the difficulty preventing introduction and subsequent spread of infection. Management of risk in care homes requires good evidence on the most important transmission pathways. One hypothesised route at the start of the pandemic, prior to widespread testing, was transfer of patients from hospitals, which were experiencing high levels of nosocomial events.

MethodsWe tested the hypothesis that hospital discharge events increased the intensity of care home cases using a national individually linked health record cohort in Wales, UK. We monitored 186,772 hospital discharge events over the period March to July 2020, tracking individuals to 923 care homes and recording the daily case rate in the homes populated by 15,772 residents. We estimated the risk of an increase in cases rates following exposure to a hospital discharge using multi-level hierarchical logistic regression, and a novel stochastic Hawkes process outbreak model.

FindingsIn regression analysis, after adjusting for care home size, we found no significant association between hospital discharge and subsequent increases in care home case numbers (odds ratio: 0.99, 95% CI 0.82, 1.90). Risk factors for increased cases included care home size, care home resident density, and provision of nursing care. Using our outbreak model, we found a significant effect of hospital discharge on the subsequent intensity of cases. However, the effect was small, and considerably less than the effect of care home size, suggesting the highest risk of introduction came from interaction with the community. We estimated approximately 1.8% of hospital discharged patients may have been infected.

InterpretationThere is growing evidence in the UK that the risk of transfer of COVID-19 from the high-risk hospital setting to the high-risk care home setting during the early stages of the pandemic was relatively small. Although access to testing was limited to initial symptomatic cases in each care home at this time, our results suggest that reduced numbers of discharges, selection of patients, and action taken within care homes following transfer all may have contributed to mitigation. The precise key transmission routes from the community remain to be quantified.",Joe Hollinghurst; Laura North; Chris Emmerson; Ashley Akbari; Fatemeh Torabi; Ronan A Lyons; Alan G Hawkes; Ed Bennett; Mike B Gravenor; Richard Fry,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253443,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253443,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
221,Learning from the Experiences of COVID-19 Survivors: A Descriptive Study,"BackgroundThere are still many unanswered questions about the novel coronavirus, however, a largely underutilized source of knowledge are the millions of people who have recovered after contracting the virus. This includes majority of undocumented cases of the COVID-19 which are classified as mild or moderate and received little to no clinical care during the course of illness.

ObjectiveTo document and glean insights from the experiences of persons with first-hand experience with coronavirus, especially the so-called mild to moderate cases that self-resolved in isolation.

MethodsThis online-based survey study called C19 Insider Scoop recruited adult participants that are 18-years or older who reside in the United States and tested positive for COVID-19 or antibodies. Participants were recruited through various methods including online support groups for COVID-19 survivors, advertisement in local news outlets, and advertisement through professional and other networks. The main outcomes measured include knowledge on contraction/transmission of the virus, symptoms, and personal experiences on road to recovery.

ResultsA total of 72 participants (53 females/19 males, ages 18 - 73 yrs. old, mean = 41-yrs.) from 22 U.S. states participated in this study. We found that the top known source of how people contracted the COVID-19 virus was through a family or household member (n=26 or 35%). This was followed by essential workers contracting the virus through the workplace (n=13 or 18%).

Participants reported up to 27 less-documented symptoms that they experienced during their illness such as brain/memory fog, palpitations, ear pain/discomfort and neurological problems. In addition, 47 out of 72 participants (65%) reported that their symptoms lasted longer than the commonly cited 2-weeks even for mild cases of COVID-19. In our study, the mean recovery time was 4.5-weeks, and exactly one-half of survivors (50%) still experienced lingering symptoms of COVID-19 after an average of 65-days following illness onset. Additionally, 37 participants (51%) reported that they experienced stigma associated with having COVID-19.

ConclusionThis study presents preliminary findings which suggests that emphasis on family/household spread of COVID-19 may be lacking and there is a general underestimation of the recovery time even for mild cases of the virus. Although a larger study is needed to validate these results, it is important to note that as more people experience COVID-19, insights from prior survivors can enable a more informed public, pave the way for others who may be affected, and guide further research.",Temiloluwa Prioleau,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253728,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253728,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
222,Evidence for antibody as a protective correlate for COVID-19 vaccines,"Though eleven novel COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy, additional affordable, scalable, and deliverable vaccines are needed to meet unprecedented global demand. With placebo-controlled efficacy trials becoming infeasible due to the roll out of licensed vaccines, a correlate of protection is urgently needed to provide a path for regulatory approval of novel vaccines. To assess whether antibody titers may reasonably predict efficacy, we evaluated the relationship between efficacy and in vitro neutralizing and binding antibodies of 7 vaccines for which sufficient data have been generated. Once calibrated to titers of human convalescent sera reported in each study, a robust correlation was seen between neutralizing titer and efficacy ({rho}= 0.79) and binding antibody titer and efficacy ({rho} = 0.93), despite geographically diverse study populations subject to different forces of infection and circulating variants, and use of different endpoints, assays, convalescent sera panels and manufacturing platforms. This correlation is strengthened by substituting post-hoc analyses for efficacy against the ancestral strain (D614G), where available. Together with an accumulating body of evidence from natural history studies and animal models, these results support the use of post-immunization antibody titers as the basis for establishing a correlate of protection for COVID-19 vaccines.",Kristen A Earle; Donna M Ambrosino; Andrew Fiore-Gartland; David Goldblatt; Peter B Gilbert; George R Siber; Peter Dull; Stanley A Plotkin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.20200246,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.20200246,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
223,Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 R.1 lineage with spike E484K mutation in Japan,"We aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 emerging lineage harboring variants in receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in Japan. Total nucleic acids were subjected to whole genome sequencing on samples from 133 patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from these patients and examined variants in RBD. As a result, three patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 harboring E484K mutation in January 2021. These three patients were relatives; one was in the 40s, and two were younger than 10 years old. They had no history of staying abroad and were living in Japan. This strains were classified into GR clade (GISAID), 20B clade (Nextstrain) and R.1 lineage (PANGO). As of March 5, 2021, the R.1 lineage have been identified in 305 samples and dominantly observed in the USA (44%, 135 / 305) and Japan (28%, 84 / 305) from the GISAID database. During the period between October 26, 2020 and February 23, 2021, the frequency of the R.1 lineage was 0.97% (84 / 8,629) of the total confirmed data in Japan and 0.15% (135 / 90,450) in the USA. Although SARS-CoV-2 R.1 lineage was not globally predominant as of March 2021, further analysis is needed to determine whether R.1 variant will disappear or expand in the future.",Yosuke Hirotsu; Masao Omata,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253248,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253248,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
224,Epitope-resolved serology test differentiates the clinical outcome of COVID-19 and identifies defects in antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 variants,"BACKGROUNDThe role of humoral immunity in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood owing, in large part, to the complexity of antibodies produced in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome.

METHODSUsing SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays, we screened 146 COVID-19 patients plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution.

RESULTSWe identified 54 linear epitopes from the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein and showed that epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than protein antigens. Specifically, we found that antibody responses to the S(811-825), S(881-895) and N(156-170) epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover, we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes.

CONCLUSIONSEpitope-resolved antibody testing not only offers a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, it may also be used as predictor of clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats.

225,Persistence and detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: immunoassay heterogeneity and implications for serosurveillance,"Serologic studies have been critical in tracking the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reliability of serologic studies for quantifying the proportion of the population that have been infected depends on the extent of antibody decay as well as on assay performance in detecting both recent and older infections. Data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persistence remain sparse, especially from infected individuals with few to no symptoms. In a cohort of mostly mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals tested with three widely-used immunoassays, antibodies persisted for at least 8 months after infection, although detection depended on immunoassay choice, with one of them missing up to 40% of past infections. Simulations reveal that without appropriate adjustment for time-varying assay sensitivity, seroprevalence surveys may underestimate infection rates. As the immune landscape becomes more complex with naturally-infected and vaccinated individuals, assay choice and appropriate assay-performance-adjustment will become even more important for the interpretation of serologic studies.",Javier Perez-Saez; Maria-Eugenia Zaballa; Sabine Yerly; Diego O Andrey; Benjamin Meyer; Isabella Eckerle; Jean Francois Balavoine; Francois Chappuis; Didier Pittet; Didier Trono; Omar Kherad; Nicolas Vuilleumier; Laurent Kaiser; Idris Guessous; Silvia Stringhini; Andrew S Azman; - Specchio-COVID19 Study Group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253710,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253710,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
226,The effect of in-person primary and secondary school instruction on county-level SARS-CoV-2 spread in Indiana,"BackgroundTo determine the county-level effect of in-person primary and secondary school reopening on daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana.

MethodsThis is a county-level population-based study using a panel data regression analysis of the proportion of in-person learning to evaluate an association with community-wide daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases. The study period was July 12-October 6, 2020. We included 73 out of 92 (79.3%) Indiana counties in the analysis, accounting for 85.7% of school corporations and 90.6% of student enrollement statewide. The primary exposure was the proportion of students returning to in-person instruction. The primary outcome was the daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100,000 residents at the county level.

ResultsThere is a statistically significant relationship between the proportion of students attending K-12 schools in-person and the county level daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 28 days later. For all ages, the coefficient of interest ({beta}) is estimated at 3.36 (95% CI: 1.91--4.81; p < 0.001). This coefficient represents the effect of a change the proportion of students attending in-person on new daily cases 28 days later. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in K-12 students attending school in-person is associated with a daily increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the county equal to 0.336 cases/100,000 residents of all ages.

227,"""This is about the coolest thing I've ever seen is that you just showed right up."" COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults: Qualitative data from two samples","BackgroundHomeless-experienced populations are at increased risk of exposure to SARS CoV-2 due to their living environments and face increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease due to underlying health conditions. Little is known about COVID-19 testing and vaccination acceptability among homeless-experienced populations.

ObjectiveTo understand the facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults.

DesignWe conducted in-depth interviews with participants from July-October 2020. We purposively recruited participants from 1) a longitudinal cohort of homeless-experienced older adults in Oakland, CA (n=37) and 2) a convenience sample of people (n=57) during a mobile outreach COVID-19 testing event in San Francisco.

ParticipantsAdults with current or past experience of homelessness.

ApproachWe asked participants about their experiences with and attitudes towards COVID-19 testing and their perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations. We used participant observation techniques to document the interactions between testing teams and those approached for testing. We audio-recorded, transcribed and content analyzed all interviews and identified major themes and subthemes.

Key ResultsParticipants found incentivized COVID-19 testing administered in unsheltered settings and supported by community health outreach workers (CHOWs) to be acceptable. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccine acceptability, citing a desire to return to routine life and civic responsibility. Those who expressed hesitancy cited a desire to see trial data, concerns that vaccines included infectious materials, and mistrust of the government.

ConclusionsParticipants expressed positive evaluations of the incentivized, mobile COVID-19 testing supported by CHOWs in unsheltered settings. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy concerns must be addressed when designing vaccine delivery strategies that overcome access challenges. Based on the successful implementation of COVID-19 testing, we recommend mobile delivery of vaccines using trusted CHOWs to address concerns and facilitate wider access to and uptake of the COVID vaccine.",Kelly R Knight; Michael R Duke; Caitlin A Carey; Graham Pruss; Cheyenne M Garcia; Marguerita Lightfoot; Elizabeth Imbert; Margot B Kushel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253743,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253743,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
228,"The Spike-specific IgA in milk commonly-elicited after SARS-Cov-2 infection is concurrent with a robust secretory antibody response, exhibits neutralization potency strongly correlated with IgA binding, and is highly durable over time","Approximately 10% of infants will experience COVID-19 illness requiring advanced care (1). A potential mechanism to protect this population could be provided by passive immunity through the milk of a previously infected mother. We and others have reported on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk (2-5). We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the milk of 75 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 88% of samples are positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA positive specimens were also positive for Spike-specific antibodies bearing the secretory component. Levels of IgA antibodies and antibodies bearing secretory component were shown to be strongly positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of high-titer in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4-6 weeks and 4-10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant Spike-specific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally, COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC50 range, 2.39 - 89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities were found to be strongly positively correlated. These data are highly relevant to public health, not only in terms of the protective capacity of these antibodies for breastfed infants, but also for the potential use of such antibodies as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given that secretory IgA is highly stable not only in milk and the infant mouth and gut, but in all mucosa including the gastrointestinal tract, upper airway, and lungs (6).",Alisa Fox; Jessica Marino; Fatima Amanat; Kasopefoluwa Y.

232,Longitudinal assessment of diagnostic test performance over the course of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection,"What is already known about this topic?Diagnostic tests and sample types for SARS-CoV-2 vary in sensitivity across the infection period.

What is added by this report?We show that both RTqPCR (from nasal swab and saliva) and the Quidel SARS Sofia FIA rapid antigen tests peak in sensitivity during the period in which live virus can be detected in nasal swabs, but that the sensitivity of RTqPCR tests rises more rapidly in the pre-infectious period. We also use empirical data to estimate the sensitivities of RTqPCR and antigen tests as a function of testing frequency.

What are the implications for public health practice?RTqPCR tests will be more effective than rapid antigen tests at identifying infected individuals prior to or early during the infectious period and thus for minimizing forward transmission (provided results reporting is timely). All modalities, including rapid antigen tests, showed >94% sensitivity to detect infection if used at least twice per week.

Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the number and severity of cases for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan.

MethodsUsing claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, we included urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from August 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. We compared the monthly ratio of inpatient cases from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. We also compared this ratio according to the severity score ""A-DROP"" and performed an interrupted time series analysis (ITS) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases.

ResultsA total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals were included. During the COVID-19 epidemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020), the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased during the epidemic compared with the same period in the past year (-48.1%), despite only a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones (mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe - 33.2%). The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 epidemic reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP significantly (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI, -521 to -1955).

ConclusionsOur study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. The milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases.",Hiroyuki Nagano; Daisuke Takada; Jung-ho Shin; Tetsuji Morishita; Susumu Kunisawa; Yuichi Imanaka,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253861,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.21253861,2021-03-20,2021-03-20,,True
234,A combined strategy to detect plasma samples reliably with high anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in routine laboratories,"The determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is of interest in many respects. High NAb titers, for example, are the most important criterion regarding the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy. However, common cell culture-based NAb assays are time-consuming and feasible only in special laboratories. Our data reveal the suitability of a novel ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) to easily measure the inhibition-capability of NAbs in the plasma of COVID-19 convalescents. We propose a combined strategy to detect plasma samples with high NAb titers ([&ge;] 1:160) reliably and to, simultaneously, reduce the risk of erroneously identifying low-titer specimens. For this approach, results of the sVNT assay are compared to and combined with those acquired from the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Both assays are appropriate for high-throughput screening in standard BSL-2 laboratories. Our measurements further show a long-lasting humoral immunity of at least 11 months after symptom onset.",Bastian Fischer; Christoph Lichtenberg; Lisa Mueller; Joerg Timm; Johannes Fischer; Cornelius Knabbe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253588,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253588,2021-03-19,2021-03-19,,True
235,Dendritic cell deficiencies persist seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection induces an exacerbated inflammation driven by innate immunity components. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the defense against viral infections, for instance plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), have the capacity to produce vast amounts of interferon-alpha (IFN-). In COVID-19 there is a deficit in DC numbers and IFN- production, which has been associated with disease severity. In this work, we described that in addition to the DC deficiency, several DC activation and homing markers were altered in acute COVID-19 patients, which were associated with multiple inflammatory markers. Remarkably, previously hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients remained with decreased numbers of CD1c+ myeloid DCs and pDCs seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the expression of DC markers as CD86 and CD4 were only restored in previously non-hospitalized patients while integrin {beta}7 and indoleamine 2,3- dyoxigenase (IDO) no restoration was observed.

236,Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants by convalescent plasma and hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulins for treatment of COVID-19,"Hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hCoV-2IG) preparations generated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CP) are under evaluation in several clinical trials of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here we explored the antibody epitope repertoire, antibody binding and virus neutralizing capacity of six hCoV-2IG batches as well as nine convalescent plasma (CP) lots against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOC). The Gene-Fragment Phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-heptad repeat regions. Antibody binding to the immunodominant epitopes was higher for hCoV-2IG than CP, with predominant binding to the fusion peptide. In the pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA) and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from around the globe were reduced to different levels by hCoV-2IG lots. The most significant loss of neutralizing activity was seen against the B.1.351 (9-fold) followed by P.1 (3.5-fold), with minimal loss of activity against the B.1.17 and B.1.429 ([&le;]2-fold). Again, the CP showed more pronounced loss of cross-neutralization against the VOCs compared with hCoV-2IG. Significant reduction of hCoV-2IG binding was observed to the RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y and minimal loss of binding to RBD-K417N compared with unmutated RBD. This study suggests that post-exposure treatment with hCoV-2IG is preferable to CP. In countries with co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, identifying the infecting virus strain could inform optimal treatments, but would likely require administration of higher volumes or repeated infusions of hCOV-2IG or CP, in patients infected with the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Juanjie Tang; Your Lee; Supriya Ravichandran; Gabrielle Grubbs; Chang Huang; Charles Stauft; Tony Wang; Basil Golding; Hana Golding; Surender Khurana,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.436183,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.436183,2021-03-19,2021-03-19,,False
237,Combined computational and cellular screening identifies synergistic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by lenvatinib and remdesivir,"Rapid repurposing of existing drugs as new therapeutics for COVID-19 has been an important strategy in the management of disease severity during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we screened by high-throughput docking 6,000 compounds within the DrugBank library for their potential to bind and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease, a chymotrypsin-like enzyme that is essential for viral replication. For 19 candidate hits, parallel in vitro fluorescence-based protease-inhibition assays and Vero-CCL81 cell-based SARS-CoV-2 replication-inhibition assays were performed. One hit, diclazuril (an investigational anti-protozoal compound), was validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro (IC50 value of 29 M) and modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-CCL81 cells. Another hit, lenvatinib (approved for use in humans as an anti-cancer treatment), could not be validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro, but serendipitously exhibited a striking functional synergy with the approved nucleoside analogue remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-CCL81 cells. Lenvatinib is a broadly-acting host receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, but the synergistic effect with remdesivir was not observed with other approved RTK inhibitors (such as pazopanib or sunitinib), suggesting that the mechanism-of-action is independent of host RTKs. Furthermore, time-of-addition studies revealed that lenvatinib/remdesivir synergy probably targets SARS-CoV-2 replication subsequent to host-cell entry. Our study shows that combining computational and cellular screening is an efficient means to identify existing drugs with repurposing potential as antiviral compounds. Future studies should aim at understanding and optimizing the lenvatinib/remdesivir synergistic mechanism as a therapeutic option.

IMPORTANCESuccessful repurposing of existing drugs as COVID-19 therapeutics would be a rapid and important means to limit disease severity during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, we used a computational screening approach to identify existing drugs that might inhibit the function of a critical enzyme (the 3CL main protease) encoded by the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. While we found that diclazuril (an investigational human drug already approved for use in animals) inhibited this viral enzyme in vitro, it only showed modest ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. However, our approach serendipitously identified lenvatinib (an anti-cancer drug approved for use in humans) as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication when combined with the existing approved antiviral drug, remdesivir. Our findings raise the possibility that future studies to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the lenvatinib/remdesivir synergy could uncover new therapeutic principles for treatment of COVID-19 or similar viral diseases.",Marie O.

238,"The inhibitory effects of toothpaste and mouthwash ingredients on the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2, and the protease activity of TMPRSS2, in vitro","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters host cells when the viral spike protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) after binding to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the mucosa of the tongue and gingiva, the oral cavity seems like it is an entry point for SARS-CoV-2. Daily oral care using mouthwash seems to play an important role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the relationship between daily oral care and the mechanisms of virus entry into host cells is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of ingredients that are generally contained in toothpaste and mouthwash on the interaction between the spike protein and ACE2 and on the serine protease activity of TMPRSS2 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in vitro enzyme assay, respectively. Both assays detected inhibitory effects of sodium tetradecene sulfonate, sodium N-lauroyl-N-methyltaurate, sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and copper gluconate. Molecular docking simulations suggested that these ingredients could bind to the inhibitor-binding site of ACE2. In addition, tranexamic acid and 6-aminohexanoic acid, which act as serine protease inhibitors, exerted inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 protease activity. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to further elucidate these mechanisms. Our findings support the possibility that toothpaste and mouthwash contain ingredients that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Riho Tateyama-Makino; Mari Abe-Yutori; Taku Iwamoto; Kota Tsutsumi; Motonori Tsuji; Satoru Morishita; Kei Kurita; Yukio Yamamoto; Eiji Nishinaga; Keiichi Tsukinoki,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.435740,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.435740,2021-03-19,2021-03-19,,False
239,"Common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) efficiently blocks the interaction between ACE2 cell surface receptor and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein D614, mutants D614G, N501Y, K417N and E484K in vitro","On 11th March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, there are rapidly spreading new ""variants of concern"" of SARS-CoV-2, the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the South African (B.1.351) or Brasilian (P.1) variant. All of them contain multiple mutations in the ACE2 receptor recognition site of the spike protein, compared to the original Wuhan sequence, which is of great concern, because of their potential for immune escape. Here we report on the efficacy of common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) to block protein-protein interaction of spike S1 to the human ACE2 cell surface receptor. This could be shown for the original spike D614, but also for its mutant forms (D614G, N501Y, and mix of K417N, E484K, N501Y) in human HEK293-hACE2 kidney and A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 lung cells. High molecular weight compounds in the water-based extract account for this effect. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles was efficiently prevented by the extract and so was virus-triggered pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 secretion. Modern herbal monographs consider the usage of this medicinal plant as safe. Thus, the in vitro results reported here should encourage further research on the clinical relevance and applicability of the extract as prevention strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Significance statementSARS-CoV-2 is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. This might eventually lead the virus into evading existing therapeutic and prophylactic approaches aimed at the viral spike. We found effective inhibition of protein-protein interaction between the human virus cell entry receptor ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike, including five relevant mutations, by water-based common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) extracts. This was shown in vitro using human kidney (HEK293) and lung (A549) cells, overexpressing the ACE2 and ACE2/TMPRSS2 protein, respectively. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus was efficiently prevented by the extract.

240,Blunted Fas signaling favors RIPK1-driven neutrophil necroptosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Critically ill COVID-19 patients are characterized by a severely dysregulated cytokine profile and elevated neutrophil counts, which are thought to contribute to disease severity. However, to date it remains unclear how neutrophils contribute to pathophysiology during COVID-19. Here, we assessed the impact of the dysregulated cytokine profile on the tightly regulated cell death program of neutrophils. We show that in a subpopulation of neutrophils, canonical apoptosis was skewed towards rapidly occurring necroptosis. This phenotype was characterized by abrogated caspase-8 activity and increased RIPK1 levels, favoring execution of necroptosis via the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis, as further confirmed in COVID-19 biopsies. Moreover, reduction of sFas-L levels in COVID-19 patients and hence decreased signaling to Fas directly increased RIPK1 levels and correlated with disease severity. Our results suggest an important role for Fas signaling in the regulation of cell death program ambiguity via the ripoptosome in neutrophils during COVID-19 and a potential therapeutic target to curb inflammation and thus influence disease severity and outcome.",Tiziano A Schweizer; Srikanth Mairpady Shambat; Clement Vulin; Sylvia Hoeller; Claudio Acevedo; Markus Huemer; Alejandro Gomez-Mejia; Chun-Chi Chang; Jeruscha Baum; Sanne Hertegonne; Eva Hitz; Daniel A Hofmaenner; Philipp K Buehler; Holger Moch; Reto A Schuepbach; Silvio D Brugger; Annelies S Zinkernagel,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.436166,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.436166,2021-03-19,2021-03-19,,False
241,A single BNT162b2 mRNA dose elicits antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and boost pre-existing humoral and T cell responses,"The standard dosing of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine validated in clinical trials includes two doses administered three weeks apart. While the decision by some public health authorities to space the doses because of limiting supply has raised concerns about vaccine efficacy, data indicate that a single dose is up to 90% effective starting 14 days after its administration. We analyzed humoral and T cells responses three weeks after a single dose of this mRNA vaccine. Despite the proven efficacy of the vaccine at this time point, no neutralizing activity were elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. However, we detected strong anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and Spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular responses dominated by the CD4+ T cell component. A single dose of this mRNA vaccine to individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 boosted all humoral and T cell responses measured, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Neutralizing responses were increased in both potency and breadth, with distinctive capacity to neutralize emerging variant strains. Our results highlight the importance of vaccinating uninfected and previously-infected individuals and shed new light into the potential role of Fc-mediated effector functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy.

In this study, we report the first cases of infection of domestic cats and dogs by the British B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed at a specialist veterinary hospital in the South-East of England. Furthermore, we discovered that many owners and handlers of these pets had developed Covid-19 respiratory symptoms 3-6 weeks before their pets became ill and had also tested PCR positive for Covid-19. Interestingly, all these B.1.1.7 infected pets developed atypical clinical manifestations, including severe cardiac abnormalities secondary to myocarditis and a profound impairment of the general health status of the patient but without any primary respiratory signs. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time the ability for companion animals to be infected by the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 and raise questions regarding its pathogenicity in these animals. Moreover, given the enhanced infectivity and transmissibility of B.1.1.7 variant for humans, these findings also highlights more than ever the risk that companion animals may potentially play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 outbreak dynamics than previously appreciated.",Luca Ferasin; Matthieu Fritz; Heidi Ferasin; Pierre Becquart; Vincent Legros; Eric M.

243,Mutational escape from the polyclonal antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely shaped by a single class of antibodies,"Monoclonal antibodies targeting a variety of epitopes have been isolated from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, but the relative contributions of these different antibody classes to the polyclonal response remains unclear. Here we use a yeast-display system to map all mutations to the viral spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by representatives of three potently neutralizing classes of anti-RBD antibodies with high-resolution structures. We compare the antibody-escape maps to similar maps for convalescent polyclonal plasma, including plasma from individuals from whom some of the antibodies were isolated. The plasma-escape maps most closely resemble those of a single class of antibodies that target an epitope on the RBD that includes site E484. Therefore, although the human immune system can produce antibodies that target diverse RBD epitopes, in practice the polyclonal response to infection is dominated by a single class of antibodies targeting an epitope that is already undergoing rapid evolution.",Allison J Greaney; Tyler N Starr; Christopher O Barnes; Yiska Weisblum; Fabian Schmidt; Marina Caskey; Christian Gaebler; Marianna Agudelo; Shlomo Finkin; Zijun Wang; Daniel Poston; Frauke Muecksch; Theodora Hatziioannou; Paul D Bieniasz; Davide F Robbiani; Michel C Nussenzweig; Pamela J Bjorkman; Jesse D Bloom,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435863,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435863,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,,False
244,"A novel SARS-CoV-2 related virus with complex recombination isolated from bats in Yunnan province, China","A novel beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the origin and direct viral ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive. Here, we discovered a new SARS-CoV-2-related virus in Yunnan province, in 2018, provisionally named PrC31, which shares 90.7% and 92.0% nucleotide identities with SARS-CoV-2 and the bat SARSr-CoV ZC45, respectively. Sequence alignment revealed that several genomic regions shared strong identity with SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetic analysis supported that PrC31 shares a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2. The receptor binding domain of PrC31 showed only 64.2% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2. Recombination analysis revealed that PrC31 underwent multiple complex recombination events within the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineages, indicating the evolution of PrC31 from yet-to-be-identified intermediate recombination strains. Combination with previous studies revealed that the beta-CoVs may possess more complicated recombination mechanism.

245,Identification of guanylyltransferase activity in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase,"SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that is responsible for the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which continues to cause significant morbidity, mortality and economic strain. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory disease and death in humans, highlighting the need for effective antiviral therapies. The RNA synthesis machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an ideal drug target and consists of non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), which is directly responsible for RNA synthesis, and numerous co-factors that are involved in RNA proofreading and 5 capping of viral mRNAs. The formation of the 5 cap-1 structure is known to require a guanylyltransferase (GTase) as well as 5 triphosphatase and methyltransferase activities. However, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping remains poorly understood. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase nsp12 functions as a GTase. We characterise this GTase activity and find that the nsp12 NiRAN (nidovirus RdRP-associated nucleotidyltransferase) domain is responsible for carrying out the addition of a GTP nucleotide to the 5 end of viral RNA via a 5 to 5 triphosphate linkage. We also show that remdesivir triphosphate, the active form of the antiviral drug remdesivir, inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 GTase reaction as efficiently as RNA polymerase activity. These data improve understanding of coronavirus mRNA cap synthesis and highlight a new target for novel or repurposed antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory RNA virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses encode an RNA polymerase which, in combination with other viral proteins, is responsible for synthesising capped viral mRNA. mRNA cap synthesis requires a guanylyltransferase enzyme; here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 guanylyltransferase is located in the viral RNA polymerase, and we identify the protein domain responsible for guanylyltransferase activity. Furthermore we demonstrate that remdesivir triphosphate, the active metabolite of remdesivir, inhibits both the guanylyltransferase and RNA polymerase functions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. These findings improve understanding of the coronavirus mRNA cap synthesis mechanism, in addition to highlighting a new target for the development of therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Alexander P Walker; Haitian Fan; Jeremy R Keown; Jonathan Grimes; Ervin Fodor,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435913,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435913,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,,False
246,Genetic variability associated with OAS1 expression in myeloid cells increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and severe COVID-19 outcomes,"Genome-wide association studies of late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD) have highlighted the importance of variants associated with genes expressed by the innate immune system in determining risk for AD. Recently, we and others have shown that genes associated with variants that confer risk for AD are significantly enriched in transcriptional networks expressed by amyloid-responsive microglia. This allowed us to predict new risk genes for AD, including the interferon-responsive oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). However, the function of OAS1 within microglia and its genetic pathway are not known. Using genotyping from 1,313 individuals with sporadic AD and 1,234 control individuals, we confirm that the OAS1 variant, rs1131454, is associated with increased risk for AD and decreased OAS1 expression. Moreover, we note that the same locus was recently associated with critical illness in response to COVID-19, linking variants that are associated with AD and a severe response to COVID-19. By analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of isolated microglia from APPNL-G-F knock-in and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, we identify a transcriptional network that is significantly upregulated with age and amyloid deposition, and contains the mouse orthologue Oas1a, providing evidence that Oas1a plays an age-dependent function in the innate immune system. We identify a similar interferon-related transcriptional network containing OAS1 by analysing scRNA-seq data from human microglia isolated from individuals with AD. Finally, using human iPSC-derived microglial cells (h-iPSC-Mg), we see that OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of microglia. When stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), we note that cells with lower OAS1 expression show an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, with increased expression and secretion of TNF-. Collectively, our data support a link between genetic risk for AD and susceptibility to critical illness with COVID-19 centred on OAS1 and interferon signalling, a finding with potential implications for future treatments of both AD and COVID-19, and the development of biomarkers to track disease progression.",Naciye Magusali; Andrew C Graham; Thomas M Piers; Pantila Panichnantakul; Umran Yaman; Maryam Shoai; Regina H Reynolds; Juan A.

247,Evaluation of a new spike (S) protein based commercial immunoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG,"BackgroundThe investigation of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 represents a key aspect in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we compared one new and four widely used commercial serological assays for the detection of antibodies targeting S (spike) and NC (nucleocapsid) protein.

MethodsSerum samples from a group of apparently non-responders, from an unbiased group of convalescent patients and from a negative control group were sim-ultaneously analyzed by the LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG ELISA and IDK(R) anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assays. IgG binding NC were detected by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and by the panimmunoglobulin immunoassay Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, samples were also tested by live virus and pseudovirus neutralization tests.

ResultsOverall, about 50% of convalescent patients with undetectable IgG antibodies using the commercial kit by Euroimmun were identified as IgG positive by Immundiagnostik and Roche. While both assays achieved similarly high sensitivities, Immundiagnostik correlated better with serum neutralizing activity than Roche.

248,The B1.351 and P.1 variants extend SARS-CoV-2 host range to mice,"Receptor recognition is a major determinant of viral host range, as well as infectivity and pathogenesis. Emergences have been associated with serendipitous events of adaptation upon encounters with a novel host, and the high mutation rate of RNA viruses has been proposed to explain their frequent host shifts 1. SARS-CoV-2 extensive circulation in humans has been associated with the emergence of variants, including variants of concern (VOCs) with diverse mutations in the spike and increased transmissibility or immune escape 2. Here we show that unlike the initial virus, VOCs are able to infect common laboratory mice, replicating to high titers in the lungs. This host range expansion is explained in part by the acquisition of changes at key positions of the receptor binding domain that enable binding to the mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor, although differences between viral lineages suggest that other factors are involved in the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs to infect mice. This abrogation of the species barrier raises the possibility of wild rodent secondary reservoirs and provides new experimental models to study disease pathophysiology and countermeasures.",Xavier Montagutelli; Matthieu Prot; Laurine Levillayer; Eduard Baquero Salazar; Gregory Jouvion; Laurine Conquet; Flora Donati; Melanie Albert; Fabiana Gambaro; Sylvie Behillil; Vincent Enouf; Dominique Rousset; Jean Jaubert; Felix Rey; Sylvie van der Werf; Etienne Simon-Loriere,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.436013,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.18.436013,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,,False
249,Evaluation of RNA extraction free method for detection of SARS-COV-2 in salivary samples for mass screening for COVID-19,"In this current COVID - 19 pandemic, there is a dire need for cost effective and less time-consuming alternatives for SARS-COV-2 testing. The RNA extraction free method for detecting SARS-COV-2 in saliva is a promising option, this study found that it has high sensitivity (85.34%), specificity (95.04%) and was comparable to the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab. The method showed good percentage of agreement (kappa coefficient) 0.797 between salivary and NPS samples. However, there are variations in the sensitivity and specificity based on the RT-PCR kit used. The Thermo Fischer-Applied biosystems showed high sensitivity, PPV and NPV but also showed higher percentage of invalid reports. Whereas the BGI kit showed high specificity, better agreement (kappa coefficient) between the results of saliva and NPS samples and higher correlation between the Ct values of saliva and NPS samples. Thus, the RNA extraction free method for salivary sample serves as an effective alternative for SARS-CoV 2-testing.",Dr. Sally Mahmoud; Ms.Esra Ibrahim; Subhashini Ganesan; Dr. Bhagyashree Thakre; Dr.Juliet Teddy; Ms.Preety Raheja; Dr.Walid Zaher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253570,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253570,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
250,Using Machine Learning along with Data Science algorithms to pre-process and forecast COVID-19 Cases and Deaths,"The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a major toll on the health and state of our global population. With tough decisions for allocating resources(i.e. vaccines)[1] are being made, forecasting through machine learning has become more important than ever. Moreover, as vaccines are being brought to the public and cases are going down, it is time that we reflect on where the pandemic has taken the most toll:for the purpose of future reform. This research illustrates two different models and algorithms for COVID-19 forecasting: Auto Regressive models and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs). The results show the true potential of RNNs to work with sequential and time-series data to forecast future cases and deaths in different states. As the paper utilizes the tanh activation function and multiple LSTM layers, the research will show the importance of machine learning and its ability to help politicians make decisions when it comes to helping states during the pandemic and future reform. The data will also pre-process the time-series data, using rolling statistics and will clean the data for the auto-regressive model and RNN layers. Thus, we show that along with Recurrent Neural Network layers, activation functions also play a crucial role in the accuracy of the forecast.",Avi Choudhary,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253571,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253571,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True

However, the seroprevalance in this group and the safety of routine administrations at outpatient infusion centers are unknown. To determine the infection rate and clinical-social factors related to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients with IMIDs and immunodeficiencies receiving routine non-cancer therapeutic infusions, we conducted a seroprevalence study at our outpatient infusion center. We report the first prospective SARS-CoV-2 sero-surveillance of 444 IBD/IMID, immunodeficiency, and immune competent patients at an outpatient infusion center in the U.S. showing lower seroprevalence in patients compared with the general population and provide clinical and social characteristics associated with seroprevalence in this group.

252,A proteome-wide genetic investigation identifies several SARS-CoV-2-exploited host targets of clinical relevance,"The virus SARS-CoV-2 can exploit biological vulnerabilities in susceptible hosts that predispose to development of severe COVID-19. Previous reports have identified several host proteins related to the interferon response (e.g. OAS1), interleukin-6 signalling (IL-6R), and the coagulation cascade (linked via ABO) that were associated with risk of COVID-19. In the present study, we performed proteome-wide genetic colocalisation tests leveraging publicly available protein and COVID-19 datasets, to identify additional proteins that may contribute to COVID-19 risk. Our analytic approach identified several known targets (e.g. ABO, OAS1), but also nominated new proteins such as soluble FAS (colocalisation probability > 0.9, p = 1 x 10-4), implicating FAS-mediated apoptosis as a potential target for COVID-19 risk. We also undertook polygenic (pan) and cis-Mendelian randomisation analyses that showed consistent associations of genetically predicted ABO protein with several COVID-19 phenotypes. The ABO signal was associated with plasma concentrations of several proteins, with the strongest association observed with CD209 in several proteomic datasets. We demonstrated experimentally that CD209 directly interacts with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a mechanism that could explain the ABO association with COVID-19. Our work provides a prioritised list of host targets potentially exploited by SARS-CoV-2 and is a precursor for further research on CD209 and FAS as therapeutically tractable targets for COVID-19.",Mohd Anisul Karim; Jarrod Shilts; Jeremy Schwartzentruber; James Hayhurst; Annalisa Buniello; Elmutaz Shaikho Elhaj Mohammed; Jie Zheng; Michael V.

253,Lessons learned from the resilience of Chinese hospitals to the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review.,"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought huge strain on hospitals worldwide, the resilience shown by Chinas hospitals appears to have been a critical factor in their successful response to the pandemic. This paper aims to determine the key findings, recommendations and lessons learned in terms of hospital resilience during the pandemic, as well as the quality and limitations of research in this field at present.

We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the resilience of hospitals in China during the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of 2020. Two online databases (the CNKI and WHO databases) were used to identify papers meeting the eligibility criteria, from which we selected 59 publications (English: n= 26; Chinese: n= 33). After extracting the data, we present an information synthesis using a resilience framework.

We found that much research was rapidly produced in the first half of 2020, describing certain strategies used to improve hospital resilience, particularly in three key areas: human resources; management and communication; and security, hygiene and planning. Our search revealed that considerable attention was focused on interventions related to training, healthcare worker well-being, e-health/ telemedicine, and work organization, while other areas, such as hospital financing, information systems and healthcare infrastructure, were less well represented in the literature.

We identified a number of lessons learned regarding how Chinas hospitals have maintained resilience when confronted with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, we also noted that the literature was dominated by descriptive case studies, often lacking consideration of methodological limitations, and that there was a lack of both highly-focused research on individual interventions and holistic research that attempted to unite the topics within a resilience framework. Research on Chinese hospitals would benefit from a greater range of analysis in order to draw more nuanced and contextualised lessons from the responses to the crisis.",Jack Stennett; Renyou Hou; Lola Traverson; Valery Ridde; Kate Zinszer; Fanny Chabrol,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253509,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253509,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
254,Real-World Effectiveness and Tolerability of Monoclonal Antibodies for Ambulatory Patients with Early COVID-19,"ImportanceInterventions to reduce hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 are urgently needed. Randomized trials for efficacy suggest that anti-SARS-CoV2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAb) may reduce medically-attended visits and hospitalization but effectiveness has not been confirmed in a real-world setting.

ObjectiveEstimate the effectiveness of MAb infusion in a real-world cohort of ambulatory patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 at high risk for hospitalization.

DesignQuasi-experimental observational cohort study using target trial emulation and causal inference methodology in pre-and post-implementation groups.

SettingInfusion centers and urgent care clinics within an integrated healthcare system in the United States

Participants13,534 high-risk adult outpatients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 within 7 days of symptom onset.

ExposuresA single intravenous infusion of either bamlanivimab 700 mg or casirivimab/imdevimab 1200 mg/1200 mg.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was emergency department visit or hospitalization within 14 days of positive test. Patients who received MAb infusion were compared to contemporaneous controls using inverse probability of treatment weighting, and to a pre-implementation cohort using propensity-weighted interrupted time series analysis. An exploratory analysis compared effectiveness of casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab.

Results7404 patients who would have been MAb-eligible were identified in a pre-implementation cohort (July 1-November 27, 2020). In the post-implementation period (November 28, 2020-January 28, 2021), 594 received MAb treatment and 5536 MAb-eligible patients did not. Among Mab recipients, 479 (80.6%) received bamlanivimab and 115 (19.4%) casirivimab/imdevimab. The primary outcome occurred in 75 (12.6%) MAb recipients, 1018 (18.4%) contemporaneous controls, and 1525 (20.6%) patients in the pre-implementation cohort. MAb treatment was associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations (odds ratio estimating the average treatment effect 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79). After implementation, propensity-weighted probability of emergency department visit or hospitalization decreased by 0.7% per day (95% CI 0.03-0.10%, p<0.001). Overall, 7 (1.2%) MAb patients experienced an adverse event; two (0.3%) were considered serious. In the exploratory analysis, the effect of casirivimab/imdevimab versus bamlanivimab was not significant (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.17-1.63, p=0.26).

Conclusions and RelevanceMAb treatment of high-risk ambulatory patients with early COVID-19 was well-tolerated and effective at preventing the need for subsequent medically-attended care.

255,"Hospitalisation rates differed by city district and ethnicity during the first wave of COVID-19 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands","BackgroundIt is important to gain insight into the burden of COVID-19 at city district level to develop targeted prevention strategies. We examined COVID-19 related hospitalisations by city district and migration background in the municipality of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

MethodsWe used surveillance data on all PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisations in Amsterdam until 31 May 2020, matched to municipal registration data on migration background. We calculated directly standardised (age, sex) rates (DSR) of hospitalisations, as a proxy of COVID-19 burden, per 100,000 population by city district and migration background. We calculated standardised rate differences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) to compare hospitalisations between city districts of varying socio-economic and health status and between migration backgrounds. We evaluated the effects of city district and migration background on hospitalisation after adjusting for age and sex using Poisson regression.

ResultsBetween 29 February and 31 May 2020, 2326 cases (median age 57 years [IQR=37-74]) were notified in Amsterdam, of which 596 (25.6%) hospitalisations and 287 (12.3%) deaths. 526/596 (88.2%) hospitalisations could be matched to the registration database. DSR were higher in individuals living in peripheral (South-East/New-West/North) city districts with lower economic and health status, compared to central districts (Centre/West/South/East) (RD=36.87,95%CI=25.79-47.96;RR=1.82,95%CI=1.65-1.99), and among individuals with a non-Western migration background compared to ethnic-Dutch individuals (RD=57.05,95%CI=43.34-70.75; RR=2.36,95%CI=2.17-2.54). City district and migration background were independently associated with hospitalisation.

We develop versatile hierarchical models for faecal RNA shedding and apply them to data collected in six studies. We find that the mean number of gene copies per mL of faeces is 1.9x106 (2.3x105--2.0x108 95% credible interval) amongst hospitalised patients. We find no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed RNA: limits of quantification can account for negative stool samples. Our models indicate that hospitalised patients represent the tail of the shedding profile with a half-life of 34 hours (28--43 95% credible interval), suggesting that wastewater-based surveillance signals are more indicative of incidence than prevalence and can be a leading indicator of clinical presentation. Shedding amongst inpatients cannot explain high RNA concentrations observed in wastewater, consistent with more abundant shedding during the early infection course.",Till Hoffmann; Justin Alsing,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253603,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253603,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True

We carried out a bibliometric analysis to describe the COVID-19 research output in Africa.

MethodsWe searched for articles published between 1st December 2019 and 3rd January 2021 from various databases including PubMed, African Journals Online, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, Collabovid, the World Health Organisation global research database and Google for grey literature. Editorial type publications and papers reporting original research done in Africa and were included. Data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel.

ResultsA total of 1296 articles were retrieved. 46.6% were primary research articles, 48.6% were editorials type articles while 4.6% were secondary research articles. 20.3% articles used the entire continent of Africa as their study setting while South Africa (15.4%) was the most common country focused setting. 90.3% of the articles had at least one African researcher as author, 78.5% had an African researcher as first author, while 63.5% had an African researcher as last author. The University of Cape Town tops the list with the greatest number of first and last authors.

A significant increase in circulating plasmablasts is characteristic of COVID-19 though the underlying mechanisms and its prognostic implications are not known. Here, we demonstrate that in the acute phase of COVID-19, activated PD-1highCXCR5-CD4+ T cells, peripheral helper T cells, (Tph) are significantly increased and promote inflammatory tissue-homing plasmablasts in patients with stable but not severe COVID-19. Analysis of scRNA-seq data revealed that plasmablasts in stable patients express higher levels of tissue-homing receptors including CXCR3. The increased Tph cells exhibited ""B cell help"" signatures similar to that of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and promoted B cell differentiation in vitro. Compared with cTfh cells, Tph cells produced more IFN{gamma}, inducing tissue-homing chemokine receptors on plasmablasts. Finally, expansion of activated Tph cells was correlated with the frequency of CXCR3+ plasmablasts in the acute phase of patients with stable disease.

260,COVID-19 with early neurological and cardiac thromboembolic phenomena--timeline of incidence and clinical features,"BackgroundAt our tertiary care public hospital, we saw COVID-19 presenting with thromboembolic phenomena, indicating a possible early thrombo-inflammatory pathology.

ObjectivesWe documented patients with cardiac and neurological thromboembolic phenomena as a primary presentation of COVID-19, and compared a subset of COVID associated strokes against COVID-19 patients without thrombotic manifestations.

MethodsWe included all COVID-Stroke and COVID-ACS (COVID-19, with ischemic arterial stroke/Acute Coronary Syndrome presenting prior to/simultaneous with/within 72 hours of systemic/respiratory COVID manifestations) admitted from April to November 2020. In the nested case control analysis, we used unpaired T-test and chi-square test to study differences between COVID-Strokes (case group) and non-thrombotic COVID controls.

Results and ConclusionsWe noted 68 strokes and 122 ACS associated with COVID-19. ACS peaked in May-June, while stroke admissions peaked later in September-October, possibly because severe strokes may have expired at home during the lockdown.

In the case-control analysis, cases (n=43; 12F:31M; mean age 51.5 years) had significantly higher D-Dimer values than controls (n=50; 9F:41M; mean age 51.6 years). Mortality was significantly higher in cases (51.2% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.018). We noted 7.5 times higher mortality in cases versus controls even among patients needing minimal oxygen support. Imaging in 37 patients showed both anterior and posterior circulation territories affected in seven, with almost half of Carotid territory strokes being large hemispherical strokes. Additionally, CT/MRI angiography in 28 strokes showed large vessel occlusions in 19 patients. Death in cases thus probably occurred before progression to intense respiratory support, due to severe central nervous system insult.

Binary logistic regression analysis showed respiratory support intensity to be the sole independent predictor of mortality among cases. Respiratory distress could have been due to COVID-19 lung infection or aspiration pneumonia resulting from obtunded sensorium. In controls, mortality was predicted by increasing age, female sex, and respiratory support intensity.",Uma Sundar; Sanah Merchant; Meera Shah; Amita Mukhopadhyay; Shaonak Kolte; Pramod Darole; Sharvari Mahajan; Ashank Bansal; Satish Gosavi; Dnaneshwar Asole; Niteen Karnik; Ajay Mahajan; Anagha Joshi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253619,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253619,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
261,The course of the UK COVID 19 pandemic; no measurable impact of new variants.,"IntroductionIn November 2020, a new SARS-COV-2 variant or the  Kent variant emerged in the UK, and became the dominant UK SARS-COV-2 variant, demonstrating faster transmission than the original variant, which rapidly died out. However, it is unknown if this altered the overall course of the pandemic as genomic analysis was not common place at the outset and other factors such as the climate could alter the viral transmission rate over time. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the overall observed viral transmission was not altered by the emergence of the new variant, by testing a model generated earlier in the pandemic based on lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity.

MethodsFrom 1/1/20 to 4/2/21, the daily incidence of SARS-COV-2 deaths and the overall stringency of National Lockdown policy on each day was extracted from the Oxford University Government response tracker. The daily average temperature and humidity for London was extracted from Wunderground.com.

The viral reproductive rate was calculated on a daily basis from the daily mortality data for each day. The correlation between log10 of viral reproductive rate and lockdown stringency and weather parameters were compared by Pearson correlation to determine the time lag associated with the greatest correlation.

A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed using lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity for the period 1/1/20 to 30/9/20. This model was extrapolated forward from 1/10/20 to 4/2/21 and the predicted viral reproductive rate, daily mortality and cumulative mortality were compared with official data.

ResultsOn multivariate linear regression, the optimal model had and R2 0f 0.833 for prediction of log10 viral reproductive rate 13 days later in the model construction period, with (coefficient, probability) lockdown stringency (-0.0109, p=0.0000), humidity (0.0038, p=0.0041) and temperature (-0.0035, p=0.0008). When extrapolated to the validation period (1/10/20 to 4/2/21), the model was highly correlated with daily (Pearson coefficient 0.88, p=0.0000) and cumulated SARS-COV-2 mortality (Pearson coefficient 0.99, p=0.0000).

264,Characterizing altruistic motivation in potential volunteers for SARS-CoV-2 challenge trials,"In human challenge trials, volunteers are deliberately infected with a pathogen to accelerate vaccine development and answer key scientific questions. In the U.S., preparations for challenge trials with the novel coronavirus are complete, and in the U.K., challenge trials have recently begun. However, ethical concerns have been raised about the potential for invalid consent or exploitation. These concerns largely reflect worries that challenge trial volunteers may be unusually risk-seeking or too economically vulnerable to refuse the payments these trials provide, rather than being motivated primarily by altruistic goals. We conducted the first large-scale survey of intended human challenge trial volunteers and found that SARS-CoV-2 challenge trial volunteers exhibit high levels of altruistic motivations without any special indication of poor risk perception or economic vulnerability. Findings indicate that challenge trials with the novel coronavirus can attract volunteers with background conditions, attitudes, and motivations that should allay key ethical concerns.",Sophie M.

265,A Longitudinal Analysis of COVID-19 Lockdown Stringency on Sleep and Resting Heart Rate Measures across 20 Countries,"Lockdowns imposed to stem the spread of COVID-19 massively disrupted the daily routines of many worldwide, but studies to date are mostly confined to observations within a limited number of countries, based on subjective reports and survey from specific time periods during the pandemic. We investigated associations between lockdown stringency and objective sleep and resting-heart rate measures in 113,000 users of a consumer sleep tracker across 20 countries from Jan-Jul 2020. With stricter lockdown measures, midsleep times were universally delayed, particularly on weekdays, while midsleep variability and resting heart rate declined. These shifts (midsleep: +0.09 to +0.58 hours; midsleep variability: -0.12 to -0.26 hours; resting heart rate: -0.35 to -2.08 bpm) correlated with the severity of lockdown across different countries and highlight the graded influence of mobility restriction and social isolation on human physiology.",Ju Lynn Ong; TeYang Lau; Mari Karsikas; Hannu Kinnunen; Michael W.L.

266,"COVID-19 and Cognitive Impairment: Severity, Evolution, and Functional Impact during Inpatient Rehabilitation","ObjectiveTo determine the frequency, magnitude, and change in cognitive impairment in patients with COVID-19 undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. We secondarily evaluated correlates of cognitive impairment and the relationship between cognition and functional gain.

DesignCross-sectional observational study with assessments at admission and discharge

SettingAcute inpatient rehabilitation unit within a large, urban academic medical center

Participants77 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and subsequently admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit between March-August 2020, 45 of whom were re-assessed at discharge.

InterventionsN/A

Main Outcome MeasuresMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores on admission and discharge (when available) and Quality Indicator for Self-Care (QI-SC) scores on admission and discharge.

Results62/77 (80.5%) of patients demonstrated cognitive deficits on the MoCA at admission: 39/77 (50.6%) were mildly impaired, 20/77 (26%) moderately impaired, and 3/77 (3.9%) severely impaired. Cognitive impairment was associated with a prior history of delirium, but not age or length of acute care hospitalization. 32/45 (71.1%) patients with discharge scores improved and met the MoCA minimally clinically important difference (MCID); however, 35/45 (77.8%) continued to score in the impaired range. Patients who met the MoCA MCID demonstrated significantly greater QI-SC score gains than those that did not meet the MCID (p=.02).

ConclusionCognitive impairment is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring acute inpatient rehabilitation. Cognitive impairment improves over the course of inpatient rehabilitation, and is associated with functional gain. Nonetheless, cognitive deficits frequently remain present at discharge, indicating the need for systematic assessment and follow-up, especially given the association with functional outcome.",Ruchi Patel; Irene Savrides; Christine Cahalan; Gargi Doulatani; Michael W.

267,Post-viral parenchymal lung disease of COVID-19 and viral pneumonitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundApproximately half of patients discharged following COVID-19 related hospitalisation are reported to suffer from persisting respiratory symptoms. We assess the prevalence of long term radiological and functional pulmonary sequelae in survivors from COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in published literature.

MethodsWe performed systematic review and meta-analysis of all original studies in adults admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or Influenza pneumonia and followed within 12 months from discharge. Searches were run on MEDLINE and Embase, with the last update on 1st March 2021. Primary outcomes were presence of 1) radiologic sequelae at CT scans; 2) restrictive impairment; 3) reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). This review is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42020183139.

ResultsSixty studies were included for qualitative synthesis, of which 41 were suitable for meta-analysis. On follow up CT scans, the overall estimated proportion was 0{middle dot}56 (95%CI 0{middle dot}44 to 0{middle dot}66, I2= 94{middle dot}44%) for inflammatory changes, and 0{middle dot}40 (95%CI 0{middle dot}29 to 0{middle dot}52, I2=95{middle dot}19%) for fibrotic findings. In SARS-CoV-2 specifically, proportions were estimated at 0{middle dot}43 (95%CI 0{middle dot}32 to 0{middle dot}56, I2=94.60%) and 0{middle dot}30 (95%CI 0{middle dot}19 to 0{middle dot}43, I2=94.89%) for inflammatory and fibrotic findings, respectively. Overall proportion for restrictive impairment was 0{middle dot}19 (95%CI 0{middle dot}12 to 0{middle dot}27, I2=94{middle dot}46%), DLCO reduction was estimated at 0{middle dot}45 (95%CI 0{middle dot}38 to 0{middle dot}52, I2=90{middle dot}10). Elevated radiological and functional estimates persisted across follow-up times. Confidence in the estimates was deemed very low as studies were largely observational without control groups, heterogeneity in estimates was high but was not clearly attributable to between-study differences of severity or design.

ConclusionAlthough estimates of prevalence are likely limited by differences in case mix and initial severity, a substantial proportion of radiological and functional sequelae are observed following viral pneumonitis, including COVID-19. This highlights the importance of vigilant radiological and functional follow up.

268,Understanding Convergence Between Non-Hispanic Black and White COVID-19 Mortality: A County-Level Approach,"BackgroundNon-Hispanic Black populations have suffered greater per capita COVID-19 mortality at more than 1.5 times that of White populations. Previous work has established that, over time, rates of Black and White mortality have converged; however, some studies suggest that regional shifts in COVID-19 prevalence may play a role in the relative change between racial groups. This studys objective was to investigate changes in Black and White COVID-19 mortality over time and uncover potential mechanisms driving these changes.

Methods and FindingsUsing county-level COVID-19 mortality data stratified by race, we investigate the trajectory of non-Hispanic Black mortality, White mortality, and the Black/White per capita mortality ratio from June 2020-January 2021. Over this period, in the counties studied, cumulative mortality rose by 56.7% and 82.8% for Black and White populations respectively, resulting in a decrease in mortality ratio of 0.369 (23.8%). These trends persisted even when a county-level fixed-effects model was used to estimate changes over time within counties (controlling for all time-invariant county level characteristics and removing the effects of changes in regional distribution of COVID-19). Next, we leverage county-level variation over time in COVID-19 prevalence to show that the decline in the Black/White mortality ratio can be explained by changes in COVID-19 prevalence. Finally, we study heterogeneity in the time trend, finding that convergence occurs most significantly in younger populations, areas with less dense populations, and outside of the Northeast. Limitations include suppressed data in counties with fewer than 10 deaths in a racial category, and the use of provisional COVID-19 death data that may be incomplete.

ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that convergence in Black/White mortality is not driven by county-level characteristics or changes in the regional dispersion of COVID-19, but instead by changes within counties. Further, declines in the Black/White mortality ratio appear strongly linked to changes in COVID-19 prevalence, rather than a time-specific effect. Further studies on changes in exposure by race over time, or on the vulnerability of individuals who died at different points in the pandemic, may provide crucial insight on mechanisms and strategies to further reduce COVID-19 mortality disparities.",Ralph Ignacio Lawton; Kevin Z Zheng; Daniel Zheng; Erich S Huang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253566,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253566,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
269,Tocilizumab Effect in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Control Trials,"Since the emergence of the first cases of COVID-19 viral pneumonia late 2019 several studies evaluated the benefits of different treatment modalities. Early in the pandemic, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antibody Tocilizumab was considered in view of the cytokine release syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection. Several early observational studies showed beneficial effect of treatment with Tocilizumab on mortality, however, results from well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCT) were contradicting.

ObjectivesTo perform a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of RCTs utilizing Tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, with in-hospital mortality as a primary objective, while secondary objectives included composite outcome of mortality, intubation, or ICU admission, another secondary outcome was super added infection.

MethodThis was a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) model of relative risk (RR), along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, p values, and forest plots of both primary and secondary outcomes. A fixed effect sensitivity test was performed for the primary outcome, in addition to subgroup and meta-regression analyses with predefined criteria.

ResultsThe primary outcome of mortality showed statistically insignificant reduction of mortality with Tocilizumab (RR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8 - 1.01; p = 0.09) although with an unmistakable apparent clinical benefit. There was a significant reduction in the RR of the secondary composite outcome (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.9; p < 0.001), and no difference between groups in super-added infection (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.51 - 1.19; p = 0.24). Treatment protocol allowing a second dose was the only significant predictor of improved mortality in the meta-regression analysis. Certainty of evidence was reduced to moderate for the primary outcome and the secondary outcome of clinical deterioration, while it was reduced to low for the secondary outcome of super-added infection.

ConclusionModerate certainty of evidence suggest no statistically significant improvement of 28-30 day all-cause mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with TCZ, although there may be clinically important value. Moderate certainty of evidence suggest lowered relative risk of a composite outcome of death or clinical deterioration, while, low grade evidence indicate no increase in the risk of super-added infection associated with TCZ treatment. A protocol allowing two doses of TCZ shows evidence of improved mortality as compared to a strictly single dose protocol.",Waleed Tharwat Aletreby; Basheer Abdulrahman; Ahmed Fouad Mady; Alfateh Mohammed Noor; Mohammed H Lhmdi; Fahad Faqihi; Abdulrahman M Alharthy; Mohammed A Al-Odat; Dimitrios Karakitsos; Ziad Memish,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253581,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253581,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True

271,Associations of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness with patient age and comorbidities,"Vaccinations are considered the major tool to curb the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine has demonstrated a 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 disease. These results are now corroborated with statistical analyses of real-world vaccination rollouts, but resolving vaccine effectiveness across demographic groups is challenging. Here, applying a multivariable logistic regression analysis approach to a large patient-level dataset, including SARS-CoV-2 tests, vaccine inoculations and personalized demographics, we model vaccine effectiveness at daily resolution and its interaction with sex, age and comorbidities. Vaccine effectiveness gradually increased post day 12 of inoculation, then plateaued, around 35 days, reaching 91.2% [CI 88.8%-93.1%] for all infections and 99.3% [CI 95.3%-99.9%] for symptomatic infections.

272,Quantitative Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test and Antigen Testing Algorithms: A Decision Analysis Simulation Model,"BackgroundAntigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 offer advantages over nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs, such as RT-PCR), including lower cost and rapid return of results, but show reduced sensitivity. Public health organizations continue to recommend different strategies for utilizing NAATs and antigen tests in various settings. There has not yet been a quantitative comparison of the expected performance of these strategies.

MethodsWe utilized a decision analysis approach to simulate the expected outcomes of six algorithms for implementing NAAT and antigen testing, analogous to testing strategies recommended by public health organizations. Each algorithm was simulated 50,000 times for four SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence levels ranging from 5% to 20% in a population of 100000 persons seeking testing. Primary outcomes were number of missed cases, number of false-positive diagnoses, and total test volumes. Outcome medians and 95% uncertainty ranges (URs) were reported.

ResultsAlgorithms that use NAATs to confirm all negative antigen results minimized missed cases but required high NAAT capacity: 92,200 (95% UR: 91,200-93,200) tests (in addition to 100,000 antigen tests) at 10% prevalence. Substituting repeat antigen testing in lieu of NAAT confirmation of all initial negative antigen tests resulted in 2,280 missed cases (95% UR: 1,507-3,067) at 10% prevalence. Selective use of NAATs to confirm antigen results when discordant with symptom status (e.g., symptomatic persons with negative antigen results) resulted in the most efficient use of NAATs, with 25 NAATs (95% UR: 13-57) needed to detect one additional case at 10% prevalence compared to exclusive use of antigen tests.

ConclusionsNo single SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithm is likely to be optimal across settings with different levels of prevalence and for all programmatic priorities; each presents a trade-off between prioritized outcomes and resource constraints. This analysis provides a framework for selecting setting-specific strategies to achieve acceptable balances and trade-offs between programmatic priorities and constraints.

The aim of this work was to determine previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in those attending the campus during city lockdown. A total of 237 individuals including 93 women and 144 men were evaluated using chemiluminescent detection of IgG anti N-viral protein. There were 32 positives giving a seroprevalence of 13.5% (10 women and 22 men) and mostly asymptomatic (68.75%).

274,"Patterns of compliance with COVID-19 preventive behaviours: a latent class analysis of 20,000 UK adults","BackgroundGovernments have implemented a range of measure to tackle COVID-19, primarily focusing on changing citizens behaviours in order to lower transmission of the virus. Few studies have looked at the patterns of compliance with different measures within individuals: whether people comply with all measures or selectively choose some but not others. Such research is important for designing interventions to increase compliance.

MethodsWe used cross-sectional data from 20,947 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected 17 November - 23 December 2020. Self-report compliance was assessed with six behaviours: mask wearing, hand washing, indoor household mixing, outdoor household mixing, social distancing, and compliance with other guidelines. Patterns of compliance behaviour were identified using latent class analysis, and multinomial logistic regression was used to assess demographic, socioeconomic and personality predictors of behaviour patterns.

ResultsWe selected a four latent class solution. Most individuals reported similar levels of compliance across the six behaviour measures. High levels of compliance was the modal response. Lower self-reported compliance was related to young age, high risk-taking behaviour, low confidence in government, and low empathy, among other factors. Looking at individual behaviours, mask wearing had the highest level of compliance whilst compliance with social distancing was relatively low.

ConclusionResults suggest that individuals choose to comply with all guidelines, rather than some but not others.

ObjectiveEvaluation of a testing program to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a large university.

DesignProspective longitudinal study using remote contactless enrollment, daily mobile symptom and exposure tracking, and self-swab sample collection. Individuals were tested if the participant was (1) exposed to a known case, developed new symptoms, or reported high-risk behavior, (2) a member of a group experiencing an outbreak, or (3) at baseline upon enrollment.

SettingAn urban, public university during Autumn quarter of 2020

ParticipantsStudents, staff, and faculty.

MeasurementsSARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was conducted, and viral genome sequencing was performed.

ResultsWe enrolled 16,476 individuals, performed 29,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests, and detected 236 infections. Greek community affiliation was the strongest risk factor for testing positive. 75.0% of positive cases reported at least one of the following: symptoms (60.8%), exposure (34.7%), or high-risk behaviors (21.5%). 88.1% of viral genomes (52/59) sequenced from Greek-affiliated students were genetically identical to at least one other genome detected, indicative of rapid SARS-CoV-2 spread within this group, compared to 37.9% (11/29) of genomes from non-Greek students and employees.

LimitationsObservational study.

ConclusionIn a setting of limited resources during a pandemic, we prioritized testing of individuals with symptoms and high-risk exposure during outbreaks. Rapid spread of SARS- CoV-2 occurred within outbreaks without evidence of further spread to the surrounding community.

276,Vaccine escape in a heterogeneous population: insights for SARS-CoV-2 from a simple model,"As a counter measure to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there has been swift development and clinical trial assessment of candidate vaccines, with subsequent deployment as part of mass vaccination campaigns. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated the ability to mutate and develop variants, which can modify epidemiological properties and the potentially also the effectiveness of vaccines.

The widespread deployment of highly effective vaccines may rapidly exert selection pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus directed towards mutations that escape the vaccine induced immune response. This is particularly concerning whilst infection is widespread. By developing and analysing a mathematical model of two population groupings with differing vulnerability and contact rates, we explore the impact of the deployment of vaccine amongst the population on R, cases, disease abundance and vaccine escape pressure.

The results from this model illustrate two insights (i) vaccination aimed at reducing prevalence could be more effective at reducing disease than directly vaccinating the vulnerable; (ii) the highest risk for vaccine escape can occur at intermediate levels of vaccination. This work demonstrates a key principle that the careful targeting of vaccines towards particular population groups could reduce disease as much as possible whilst limiting the risk of vaccine escape.",Julia Rose Gog; Edward M Hill; Leon Danon; Robin N Thompson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253544,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253544,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
277,Impact of booster COVID-19 vaccine for Moroccan adults: A discrete age-structured model approach,"Public health control strategies, such as lockdown, seem to be effective in reducing the spread of the pandemic, but are ineffective as a whole since lockdown is responsible of global economic crisis and badly lived by the majority of children and adults who have developed mental health disorders and familial problems as well. Thus, the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is needed to control this disease. We have developed a discrete age-structured model and followed the Moroccan vaccination program to assess the impact of booster vaccination targeting Moroccan adults against COVID-19. Using the derived model, we estimated some relevant model parameters related to COVID-19 using collected cumulative mortality and reported Moroccan data. A control reproduction number Rc, which determines the necessary level of vaccine uptake that lead to COVID-19 eradication is determined. Furthermore, a herd immunity threshold above which the population can be protected from COVID-19 infection is derived. Analyzing the model, sufficient and necessary conditions for the eradication of the disease are obtained as well. Next, we perform numerical simulations to study the impact of several uptake levels of the potential vaccine on the persistence and the extinction of COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the COVID-19 is expected to last past 2021 in the absence of a vaccination program. Moreover, a vaccination of the adult population at rate 0.6% per day needs at least 67% of vaccine efficacy and 90% of immunogenicity rate to eradicate the disease. Using Sinopharm vaccine, the herd immunity can be achieved when about half of Moroccan adult population is immunized against the COVID-19. However, using Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, less than 60% of adult population must be immunized against the disease to achieve the herd immunity. Finally, if vaccine efficacy is about 80% and the immunogenicity is about 50% then vaccinating adults at rate of 0.6% per day could protect roughly 22% of children from COVID-19 infection.",Aayah Hammoumi; Hanane Hmarrass; Redouane Qesmi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253555,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253555,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True

We describe the genomic epidemiology of travel-related cases in England and evaluate the effectiveness of this travel policy.

MethodsBetween 27/05/2020 and 13/09/2020, probable travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cases and their contacts were identified and combined with UK SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. The epidemiology and demographics of cases was identified, and the number of contacts per case modelled using negative binomial regression to estimate the effect of travel restriction, and any variation by age, sex and calendar date. Unique travel-related SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the COG-UK dataset were identified to estimate the effect travel restrictions on cluster size generated from these. The Polecat Clustering Tool was used to identify a travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cluster of infection.

Findings4,207 travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cases are identified. 51.2% (2155/4207) of cases reported travel to one of three countries; 21.0% (882) Greece, 16.3% (685) Croatia and 14.0% (589) Spain. Median number of contacts per case was 3 (IQR 1-5), and greatest for the 16-20 age-group (9.0, 95% C.I.=5.6-14.5), which saw the largest attenuation by travel restriction. Travel restriction was associated with a 40% (rate ratio=0.60, 95% C.I.=0.37-0.95) lower rate of contacts. 827/4207 (19.7%) of cases had high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes available. Fewer genomically-linked cases were observed for index cases related to countries with travel restrictions compared to cases from non-travel restriction countries (rate ratio=0.17, 95% C.I.=0.05-0.52). A large travel-related cluster dispersed across England is identified through genomics, confirmed with contact-tracing data.

InterpretationThis study demonstrates the efficacy of travel restriction policy in reducing the onward transmission of imported cases.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Web of Science and Scopus for the terms (COVID-19 OR SARS-COV-2) AND (imported or importation) AND (sequenc* OR genom* or WGS). We filtered the 55 articles identified through this search and rejected any that did not undertake SARS-CoV-2 sequencing as part of an epidemiological investigation for importation into a different country. The remaining 20 papers were reviewed in greater detail to understand the patterns of importation and the methods used in each case.

Added value of this studyThis is the first published study on importations of SARS-CoV-2 into England using genomics. Plessis et al., (2021) used a predictive model to infer the number of importations in to the UK from all SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated before 26th June 2020. The current study assesses the period 27/05/2020 to 13/09/2020 and presents findings of case-reported travel linked to genomic data. Two unpublished reports exist for Wales and Scotland, although only examine a comparatively small number of importations.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis large-scale study has a number of findings that are pertinent to public health and of global significance, not available from prior evidence to our knowledge. The study demonstrates travel restrictions, through the implementation of  travel-corridors, are effective in reducing the number of contacts per case based on observational data. Age has a significant effect on the number of contacts and this can be mitigated with travel restrictions. Analysis of divergent clusters indicates travel restrictions can reduce the number of onwards cases following a travel-associated case. Analysis of divergent clusters can allow for importations to be identified from genomics, as subsequently evidenced by cluster characteristics derived from contact tracing. The majority of importations of SARS-CoV-2 in England over Summer 2020 were from coastal European countries. The highest number of cases and onward contacts were from Greece, which was largely exempt from self-isolation requirements (bar some islands in September at the end of the study period). Systematic monitoring of imported SARS-CoV-2 cases would help refine implementation of travel restrictions. Finally, along with multiple studies, this study highlights the use of genomics to monitor and track importations of SARS-CoV-2 mutations of interest; this will be of particular use as the repertoire of clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants expand over time and globally.",Dinesh Aggarwal; Andrew J Page; Ulf Schaefer; George M Savva; Richard Myers; Erik Volz; Nicholas Ellaby; Steven Platt; Natalie Groves; Eileen Gallaghar; Niamh M.

279,Can we predict antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2? A cohort analysis.,"BackgroundAfter infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and virus-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) develop. This study describes antibody responses in a cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients to identify predictors.

MethodsWe recruited patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from Heidelberg, Germany. Blood samples were collected three weeks after COVID-19 symptoms ended. Participants with high antibody titers were invited for follow-up visits. IgG titers were measured by the Euroimmun Assay, and nAbs titers in a SARS-CoV-2 infection-based assay.

Results281 participants were enrolled between April and August 2020 with IgG testing, 145 (51.6%) had nAbs, and 35 (12.5%) had follow-up. The median IgG optical density (OD) ratio was 3.1 (Interquartile range (IQR) 1.6-5.1), and 24.1% (35/145) had a nAb titer>1:80. Higher IgG titers were associated with increased age and more severe disease, and higher nAbs were associated with male gender and CT-value of 25-30 on RT-PCR at diagnosis. The median IgG OD ratio on follow-up was 3.7 (IQR 2.9-5.9), a median increase of 0.5 (IQR -0.3-1.7). Six participants with follow-up nAbs all had titers [&le;] 1:80.

ConclusionsWhile age and disease severity were correlated with IgG responses, predictive factors for nAbs in convalescent patients remain unclear.",Mary Gaeddert; Philip Kitchen; Tobias Broger; Stefen Weber; Ralf Bartenschlager; Anna Plaszczyca; Hans-Georg Kräusslich; Barbara Müller; Margarida Souto-Carneiro; Maike Janssen; Carsten Müller-Tidow; Uta Merle; Yannis Herrmann; Lukas Raedeker; Jakob Sebastian; Niall Brindl; Tim Starck; Claudia M.

281,A feasible and more efficient SARS-Cov-2 vaccine allocation to states and counties in the USA,"While discussion of vaccine allocation has centered around who should be prioritized (e.g., health care personnel and the elderly), we argue that vaccines should also be allocated to jurisdictions (e.g., counties within the USA) with the greatest immunization thresholds needed for ending the epidemic. At the current rate of vaccine distribution (March 15, 2021), universal herd immunity in the USA could be reached in roughly 4.5 months. However, distributing vaccines according to where the virus spreads more easily (dense counties with high R0 values), herd immunity would be reached simultaneously in all counties almost two months earlier and would require roughly 40% fewer vaccine doses. Furthermore, under the current distribution strategy densely populated counties would reach herd immunity last, with negative epidemiological and socio-economic consequences. In sum, it would be more fair and efficient to distribute vaccines to jurisdictions that need them most to reach herd immunity.",Anthony R Ives; Claudio Bozzuto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253793,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253793,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
282,Estimating the increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain over previously circulating strains in England using fractions of GISAID sequences and the distribution of serial intervals,"The B.1.1.7 strain, a variant strain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is thought to have higher transmissibility than previously circulating strains in England. The fraction of the B.1.1.7 strain among SARS-CoV-2 viruses in England have grown rapidly. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains using the time course of the fraction of B.1.1.7 strains. Our approach is based on the Maynard Smith's model of allele frequencies in adaptive evolution, which assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant over time. Applying this method to the sequence data in England using serial intervals of COVID-19, we found that the transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain is 40% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 40% to 41%) higher than previously circulating strains in England. The date of the emergence of B.1.1.7 strains in England was estimated to be September 20, 2020 with its 95% CI from September 11 to September 20, 2020. The result indicated that the control measure against the B.1.1.7 strain needs to be strengthened by 40% from that against previously circulating strains. To get the same control effect, contact rates between individuals need to be restricted to 0.71 of the contact rates that have been achieved form the control measure taken for previously circulating strains.",Chayada Piantham; Kimihito Ito,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253775,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.21253775,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
283,Metagenomic sequencing of municipal wastewater provides a near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence identified as the B.1.1.7 variant of concern from a Canadian municipality concurrent with an outbreak,"Laboratory-based wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, can be conducted using RT-qPCR-based screening of municipal wastewater samples. Although it provides rapid viral detection and can inform SARS-CoV-2 abundance in wastewater, this approach lacks the resolution required for viral genotyping and does not support tracking of viral genome evolution. The recent emergence of several variants of concern, a result of mutations across the genome including the accrual of important mutations within the viral spike glycoprotein, has highlighted the need for a method capable of detecting the cohort of mutations associated with these and newly emerging genotypes. Here we provide an innovative methodology for the recovery of a near-complete SARS-CoV-2 sequence from a wastewater sample collected from across Canadian municipalities including one that experienced a significant outbreak attributable to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Our results demonstrate that a combined interrogation of genome consensus-level sequences and alternative alleles enables the identification of a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern and the detection of a new allele within a viral accessory gene that may be representative of a recently evolved B.1.1.7 sublineage.",Chrystal Landgraff; Lu Ya Ruth Wang; Cody Buchanan; Matthew Wells; Justin Schonfeld; Kyrylo Bessonov; Jennifer Ali; Erin Robert; Celine Nadon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253409,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253409,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
284,THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ACB-IP 1.0 UNIVERSAL PATHOGEN FREE CONCENTRATED COCKTAIL CONVALESCENT PLASMA IN COVID-19 INFECTION,"IntroductionThe efficacy of SARS-CoV2 standard single donor convalescent plasma varied according to the application time and most importantly the amount of antibody that is administered. Single donor plasma has some drawbacks; such as the insufficient levels of neutralizing antibody activities, the requirements of blood group compatibility, and the risk of infection transmission. In this study, the efficacy and safety of pathogen inactivated, isohemagglutinin-depleted (concentrated) and pooled convalescent plasma was investigated.

MethodsIn this study, ACB-IP 1.0 convalescent plasma product was prepared as follows; first, convalescent plasma was collected from different donors, then pathogen-inactivation was carried-out, and isohemagglutinins were cryodepleted, respectively. Finally, concentrated convalescent plasma product was pooled and stored until use.

A total of sixteen patients were treated with two different convalescent plasma products. Nine patients were treated with standard single donor convalescent plasma and seven were treated with pathogen-free, concentrated, pooled convalescent plasma (ACB-IP 1.0) between 01 April 2020 and 31 December 2020.

The outcomes of these two plasma products were compared regarding SARS-CoV2 antibody titers, neutralizing antibody activities, length of hospitalization and mortality rates.

ResultsFive out of six single donor plasma SARS-CoV2 antibody titers remained below 12 s/co, but the antibody titers of all ACB-IP 1.0 plasma were above 12 s/co. SARS-CoV2 total antibody titers of ACB-IP 1.0 plasma were statistically higher than the antibody titers of single donor plasma. Mean total plasma neutralizing antibody activity of ACB-IP 1.0 plasma (1.5421) was found statistically higher than single donor plasma (0.9642) in 1:256 dilution ({rho}=0.0087)

The mortality rate of the patients treated with ACB-IP 1.0 plasma showed statistically lower (p: 0,033) than the patients treated with single donor plasma. The administration of either single donor plasma or ACB-IP 1.0 plasma to the patients within eight days significantly shortened the length of hospitalization compared to administration of either plasma to the patients later than eight days ({rho}= 0,0021)

DiscussionPathogen-free, concentrated, pooled convalescent plasma may resolve the bias in SARS-CoV2 antibody titers and neutralizing antibody activities, without requiring blood group compatibility that allows patient accessibility in a shorter time and has safe plasma characteristic. This study indicates that ACB-IP 1.0 may be a superior product compared to standard single donor plasma.

285,High risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19 with frequently encountered spontaneous breathing patterns: a computational modelling study,"BackgroundThere is ongoing controversy regarding the potential for increased respiratory effort to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%).

ResultsSimulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and to 240.5 J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that the forces generated during increased inspiratory effort in severe COVID-19 are compatible with the development of P-SILI. If conventional oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of driving and transpulmonary pressures with invasive ventilation may reduce the risk of P-SILI and allow time for the resolution of the underlying condition.",Anup Das; Liam Weaver; Sina Saffaran; Nadir Yehya; Timothy E.

286,Knowledge barriers in the symptomatic-COVID-19 testing programme in the UK: an observational study,"BackgroundSymptomatic testing programmes are crucial to the COVID-19 pandemic response. We sought to examine United Kingdom (UK) testing rates amongst individuals with test-qualifying symptoms, and factors associated with not testing.

MethodsWe analysed a cohort of untested symptomatic app users (N=1,237), nested in the Zoe COVID Symptom Study (Zoe, N= 4,394,948); and symptomatic survey respondents who wanted, but did not have a test (N=1,956), drawn from the University of Maryland-Facebook Covid-19 Symptom Survey (UMD-Facebook, N=775,746).

FindingsThe proportion tested among individuals with incident test-qualifying symptoms rose from [~]20% to [~]75% from April to December 2020 in Zoe. Testing was lower with one vs more symptoms (73.0% vs 85.0%), or short vs long symptom duration (72.6% vs 87.8%). 40.4% of survey respondents did not identify all three test-qualifying symptoms. Symptom identification decreased for every decade older (OR=0.908 [95% CI 0.883-0.933]). Amongst symptomatic UMD-Facebook respondents who wanted but did not have a test, not knowing where to go was the most cited factor (32.4%); this increased for each decade older (OR=1.207 [1.129-1.292]) and for every 4-years fewer in education (OR=0.685 [0.599-0.783]).

InterpretationDespite current UK messaging on COVID-19 testing, there is a knowledge gap about when and where to test, and this may be contributing to the [~]25% testing gap. Risk factors, including older age and less education, highlight potential opportunities to tailor public health messages.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo assess current evidence on test uptake in symptomatic testing programmes, and the reasons for not testing, we searched PubMed from database inception for research using the keywords (COVID-19) AND (testing) AND ((access) OR (uptake)). We did not find any work reporting on levels of test uptake amongst symptomatic individuals. We found three papers investigating geographic barriers to testing. We found one US based survey reporting on knowledge barriers to testing, and one UK based survey reporting on barriers in the period March - August 2020. Neither of these studies were able to combine testing behaviour with prospectively collected symptom reports from the users surveyed.

Added value of this studyThrough prospective collection of symptom and test reports, we were able to estimate testing uptake amongst individuals with test-qualifying symptoms in the UK. Our results indicate that whilst testing has improved since the start of the pandemic, there remains a considerable testing gap. Investigating this gap we find that individuals with just one test-qualifying symptom or short symptom duration are less likely to get tested. We also find knowledge barriers to testing: a substantial proportion of individuals do not know which symptoms qualify them for a COVID-19 test, and do not know where to seek testing. We find a larger knowledge gap in individuals with older age and fewer years of education.

Implications of all the available evidenceDespite the UK having a simple set of symptom-based testing criteria, with tests made freely available through nationalised healthcare, a quarter of individuals with qualifying symptoms do not get tested. Our findings suggest testing uptake may be limited by individuals not acting on mild or transient symptoms, not recognising the testing criteria, and not knowing where to get tested. Improved messaging may help address this testing gap, with opportunities to target individuals of older age or fewer years of education. Messaging may prove even more valuable in countries with more fragmented testing infrastructure or more nuanced testing criteria, where knowledge barriers are likely to be greater.",Mark S Graham; Anna May; Thomas Varsavsky; Carole Sudre; Benjamin Murray; Kerstin Klaser; Michela Antonelli; Liane Canas; Erika Molteni; Marc Modat; David Alden Drew; Long Nguyen; Benjamin Rader; Christina Hu; Joan Capdevila; Alexander Hammers; Andrew Chan; Jonathan Wolf; John Brownstein; Timothy Spector; Sebastien Ourselin; Claire Steves; Christina Astley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253719,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253719,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
287,In vivo evaluation of the virucidal efficacy of Chlorhexidine and Povidone-iodine mouthwashes against salivary SARS-CoV-2.,"BackgroundThe oral cavity is potentially high-risk transmitter of COVID-19. Antimicrobial mouthrinses are used in many clinical pre procedural situations for prophylactic purposes. An evident-based investigation for an effective mouthwash solution against salivary SARS-CoV-2 is urgently required for the exposure reduction during dental procedures.

AimsThis study aimed to evaluate in vivo virucidal efficacy of 2 mouthwashes: 1% Povidoneiodine and 0.2% Chlorhexidine as a dental preprocedural oral disinfection against salivary SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and MethodsIn this randomized-controlled clinical trial, studied group comprised laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive patients through nasopharyngeal swabs. Participants were divided into 3 groups. For 30 seconds, group A gargled with 1% Povidone-iodine, group B mouthrinsed with 0.2% Chlorhexidine and control group C mouthrinsed with distilled water. Saliva samples were collected before and 5 minutes after mouthwash. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR was then performed for each sample. Evaluation of the efficacy was based on difference in Ct value. The analysis of data was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows. Paired t test and unpaired t test were used. A probability value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

ResultsSixty-one compliant participants (36 female and 25 male) with a mean age 45.3 {+/-} 16.7 years-old were enrolled. A significant mean Ct value difference (p < 0.0001) between the paired samples in group A (n = 25) and also in group B (n = 27) (p < 0.0001) was found. In contrast, no significant difference (p = 0.566) existed before and after the experiment in the control group C (n = 9). Moreover, a significant difference was noted between the delta Ct of distilled water wash and each of the 2 solutions 1 % Povidone-iodine (p = 0.012) and Chlorhexidine 0.2% (p = 0.0024). No significant difference was found between the delta Ct of patients using 1% Povidone-iodine and Chlorhexidine 0.2% solutions (p = 0.24).

ConclusionChlorhexidine 0.2% and 1% Povidone-iodine oral solutions are effective preprocedural mouthwashes against salivary SARS-COV-2 in dental treatments.

Here we report the biophysical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 spike variants D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with affinities to the ACE2 receptor and infectivity capacity, revealing weaknesses in the developed neutralising antibody approaches. Furthermore, we report a pre-clinical characterisation package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert, with broad neutralisation capacity, that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19. This construct efficiently neutralised four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

290,Identification of ACE2 mutations that modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike binding across multiple mammalian species,"Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with different mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) cell entry receptors will help elucidate determinants of intra- and cross-species virus transmission, facilitate development of effective new vaccines for both humans and livestock animals, and guide livestock farming and coronavirus screening procedures to ensure food supply security. In this work we applied laboratory directed evolution to several mammalian ACE2s with the goal of identifying conserved ACE2 mutations that increase spike binding affinity across multiple species. We found the Gln42Leu mutation increased ACE2-spike binding for human as well as four of four other mammalian ACE2s, while the Leu79Ile mutation had a similar effect for human and three of three mammalian ACE2 orthologs. These results are especially notable given the residues high levels of representation, i.e, 83% for Gln42 and 56% for Leu79, among annotated mammalian ACE2s. We also found that substitutions at ACE2 position 34, which is relatively variable across mammalian ACE2s, increased binding for multiple ACE2 orthologs. Taken together, these results speak strongly to the plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 strains with increased ability to cross species transmission barriers.

291,SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain with a G485R mutation in complex with human ACE2,"Since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019, genomic sequencing has identified mutations in the viral RNA including in the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein. Structural characterisation of the Spike carrying point mutations aids in our understanding of how these mutations impact binding of the protein to its human receptor, ACE2, and to therapeutic antibodies. The Spike G485R mutation has been observed in multiple isolates of the virus and mutation of the adjacent residue E484 to lysine is known to contribute to antigenic escape. Here, we have crystallised the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain with a G485R mutation in complex with human ACE2. The crystal structure shows that while the G485 residue does not have a direct interaction with ACE2, its mutation to arginine affects the structure of the loop made by residues 480-488 in the receptor-binding motif, disrupting the interactions of neighbouring residues with ACE2 and with potential implications for antigenic escape from vaccines, antibodies and other biologics directed against SARS-CoV-2 Spike.",Claire Marie Weekley; Damian Francis John Purcell; Michael W Parker,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.434488,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.434488,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,False
292,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces inflammation via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway,"Pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response; however, the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly understood. Here we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNFa, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and neucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human lung epithelial cells A549 also produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly are non-inflammatory, but elicit an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway is abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein induces IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1 {beta} in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Together these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.",Shahanshah Khan; Mahnoush S.

293,Longitudinal characterization of humoral and cellular immunity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients reveal immune persistence up to 9 months after infection,"BackgroundInsights into early, specific humoral and cellular responses to infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as the persistence and magnitude of resulting immune memory is important amidst the ongoing pandemic. The combination of humoral and cellular immunity will most likely contribute to protection from reinfection or severe disease.

MethodsHere, we conducted a longitudinal study on hospitalized moderate and severe COVID-19 patients from the acute phase of disease into convalescence at five- and nine-months post symptom onset. Utilizing flow cytometry, serological assays as well as B cell and T cell FluoroSpot assays, we assessed the magnitude and specificity of humoral and cellular immune memory during and after human SARS-CoV-2 infection.

FindingsDuring acute COVID-19, we observed an increase in germinal center activity, a substantial expansion of antibodysecreting cells, and the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Despite gradually decreasing antibody levels, we show persistent, neutralizing antibody titers as well as robust specific memory B cell responses and polyfunctional T cell responses at five- and nine-months after symptom onset in both moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. Long-term SARS-CoV-2 specific responses were marked by preferential targeting of spike over nucleocapsid protein.

294,Epigallocatechin Gallate from Green Tea Effectively Blocks Infection of SARS-CoV-2 and New Variants by Inhibiting Spike Binding to ACE2 Receptor,"As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, the new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged in the different regions of the world. These newly emerged variants have mutations in their spike (S) protein that may confer resistance to vaccine-elicited immunity and existing neutralizing antibody therapeutics. Therefore, there is still an urgent need of safe, effective, and affordable agents for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and its variant infection. Here, we demonstrated that green tea beverage (GTB) or its major ingredient, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), were highly effective in inhibiting infection of live SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus (HCoV OC43). In addition, infection of the pseudoviruses with spikes of the new variants (UK-B.1.1.7, SA-B.1.351, and CA-B.1.429) was efficiently blocked by GTB or EGCG. Among the 4 active green tea catechins at noncytotoxic doses, EGCG was the most potent in the action against the viruses. The highest inhibitory activity was observed when the viruses or the cells were pre-incubated with EGCG prior to the infection. Mechanistic studies revealed that EGCG blocked infection at the entry step through interfering with the engagement of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spikes to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host cells. These data support further clinical evaluation and development of EGCG as a novel, safe, and cost-effective natural product for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection.",Jinbiao Liu; Brittany H Bodnar; Feng-Zhen Meng; Adil Khan; Xu Wang; Guangxiang George Luo; Sami Saribas; Tao Wang; Saroj Chandra Lohani; Peng Wang; Zhengyu Wei; Jinjun Luo; Lina Zhou; Jianguo Wu; Qingsheng Li; Wenhui Hu; Wenzhe Ho,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435637,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435637,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,False
295,Structural basis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of hydroxychloroquine: specific binding to NTD/CTD and disruption of LLPS of N protein,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing the catastrophic pandemic which already led to >120 millions of infections and >2.6 millions of deaths. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been shown to own promising potential in clinically combating SARS-CoV-2 but the underlying mechanisms still remain almost unknown. So far, all action sites are proposed on the host cells, and in particular no specific viral target protein has been experimentally identified. In this study, by use of DIC microscopy and NMR spectroscopy, for the first time we have decoded that HCQ specifically binds to both N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein to inhibit their interactions with nucleic acids (NAs), as well as to disrupt its NA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) essential for the viral life cycle including the package of gRNA and N protein into new virions. These results suggest that HCQ may achieve its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by interfering in several key steps of the viral life cycle. The study not only provides a structural basis for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HCQ, but also indicates that SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its LLPS represent key targets for further optimization and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.",Mei Dang; Jianxing Song,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435741,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435741,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,False
296,"The Influence of Covid-19 Vaccine on Daily Cases, Hospitalization, and Death Rate in Tennessee: A Case Study in the United States","The COVID-19 outbreak highlights the vulnerability to novel infections, and vaccination remains a foreseeable method to return to normal life. However, infrastructure is inadequate for the whole population to be vaccinated immediately. Therefore, policies have adopted a strategy to vaccinate the elderly and vulnerable population while delaying others. This study uses the Tennessee official statistic from the onset of COVID vaccination (17th of December 2021) to understand how age-specific vaccination strategies reduce daily cases, hospitalization, and death rate. The result shows that vaccination strategy can significantly influence the numbers of patients with COVID-19 in all age groups and lower hospitalization and death rates just in older age groups. The Elderly had a 95% lower death rate from December to March; however, and no change in the death rate in other age groups. The Hospitalization rate was reduced by 80% in this study cohort for people aged 80 or older, while people who were between 50 to 70 had almost the same hospitalization rate. The study indicates that vaccination targeting older age groups is the optimal way to avoid higher transmissions and reduce hospitalization and death rate for older groups.",Ali Roghani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253767,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253767,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
297,The impact of policy timing on the spread of COVID-19,"We model COVID-19 data for 89 nations and US states with a recently developed formalism that describes mathematically any pattern of growth with the minimum number of parameters. The results show that the disease has a typical duration of 18 days, with a significant increase in fatality when it lasts longer than about 4 months. Searching for correlations between ""flattening of the curve"" and preventive public policies, we find strong statistical evidence for the impact of the first implemented policy on decreasing the pandemic growth rate; a delay of one week in implementation nearly triples the size of the infected population, on average. Without any government action, the initial outburst still slows down after 36 days, possibly thanks to changes in public behavior in response to the pandemic toll. Stay-at-home (lockdown) was not the first policy of any sample member and we do not find statistically meaningful evidence for its added impact, similar to a recent study that employed an entirely different approach. However, lockdown was mostly imposed only shortly before the exponential rise was arrested. The possibility remains that lockdown might have shortened significantly the initial exponential rise had it been employed as first, rather than last resort.",Moshe Elitzur; Scott Kaplan; Zeljko Ivezic; David Zilberman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253764,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253764,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,,True
298,Characteristics and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 among children in Italy: a cross-sectional study in 20 pediatric centers,"BackgroundNo study has described factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in children.

AimDescribe characteristics and risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis in children tested in 20 pediatric centers across Italy.

MethodsCases aged 0-18 years tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 23 and May 24 2020 were included. Our primary analysis focused on children tested because of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms.

ResultsAmong 2494 children tested for SARS-CoV-2, 2148 (86.1%) had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 included - beside fever (82.4%) and respiratory signs or symptoms (60.4%) - also gastrointestinal (18.2%), neurological (18.9%), cutaneous (3.8%) and other flu-like presentations (17.8%). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 were: exposure history (adjusted OR 39.83 95%CI 17.52-90.55 p<0.0001), cardiac disease (adjusted OR 3.10 95%CI 1.19-5.02 p<0.0001), fever (adjusted OR 3.05 % 95% CI 1.67-5.58 p=0.0003), and anosmia/ageusia (OR 4.08 95%CI 1.69 -9.84 p=0.002). Among 190 (7.6%) children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, only four (2.1%) required respiratory support and two (1.1%) were admitted in ICU, while 100% recovered.

ConclusionRecommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing in children should be updated based on the evidence of broader clinical features. Exposure history, fever, and anosmia/ageusia are strong risk factors for COVID-19 in children, while other symptoms dont seem helping discriminating in between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the negative cases. This study confirm that COVID-19 is a mild disease in the general population of children in Italy.

299,Interim results of the safety and immune-efficacy of 1 versus 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 for cancer patients in the context of the UK vaccine priority guidelines,"BackgroundThe efficacy and safety profile of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been definitively established in immunocompromised patient populations. Patients with a known cancer diagnosis were hitherto excluded from trials of the vaccines currently in clinical use.

MethodsThis study presents data on the safety and immune efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in 54 healthy controls and 151 mostly elderly patients with solid and haematological malignancies, respectively, and compares results for patients who were boosted with BNT162b2 at 3 weeks versus those who were not. Immune efficacy was measured as antibody seroconversion, T cell responses, and neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and of a variant of concern (VOC) (B.1.1.7). We also collected safety data for the BNT162b2 vaccine up to 5 weeks following first dose.

FindingsThe vaccine was largely well tolerated. However, in contrast to its very high performance in healthy controls (>90% efficacious), immune efficacy of a single inoculum in solid cancer patients was strikingly low (below 40%) and very low in haematological cancer patients (below 15%). Of note, efficacy in solid cancer patients was greatly and rapidly increased by boosting at 21-days (95% within 2 weeks of boost). Too few haematological cancer patients were boosted for clear conclusions to be drawn.

ConclusionsDelayed boosting potentially leaves most solid and haematological cancer patients wholly or partially unprotected, with implications for their own health; their environment and the evolution of VOC strains. Prompt boosting of solid cancer patients quickly overcomes the poor efficacy of the primary inoculum in solid cancer patients.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSome cancer patients have been shown to exhibit sustained immune dysregulation, inefficient seroconversion and prolonged viral shedding as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Consequently, their exclusion and, in particular, the exclusion of patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapies, from the registry trials of the 5 approved COVID-19 vaccines raises questions about the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in this patient population. In addition, whilst the change in the UKs dosing interval to 12-weeks aimed to maximise population coverage, it is unclear whether this strategy is appropriate for cancer patients and those on systemic anti-cancer therapies.

Added value of this studyWe report that the RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine administered in cancer patients was well tolerated, and we provide first insights into both antibody and T cell responses to the vaccine in an immunocompromised patient population.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn cancer patients, one dose of 30ug of BNT162b2 yields poor vaccine efficacy, as measured by seroconversion rates, viral neutralisation capacity and T cell responses, at 3- and 5-weeks following the first inoculum. Patients with solid cancers exhibited a significantly greater response following a booster at 21-days. These data support prioritisation of cancer patients for an early (21-day) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Given the globally poor responses to vaccination in patients with haematological cancers, post-vaccination serological testing, creation of herd immunity around these patients using a strategy of  ring vaccination, and careful follow-up should be prioritised.",Leticia Monin-Aldama; Adam G.

300,"U.S. adolescents' mental health and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, Fall 2020","Preliminary reports suggest that during COVID-19, adolescents mental health has worsened while technology and social media use has increased. Much data derives from early in the pandemic, when schools were uniformly remote and personal/family stressors related to the pandemic were limited. This cross-sectional study, conducted during Fall 2020, examines the correlation between mental wellbeing and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, along with influence of COVID-19-related stressors, school status (in-person versus remote), and social media use for coping purposes, among 978 U.S. adolescents. Results suggest self-reported daily social media and technology use increased significantly from prior to COVID-19 through Fall 2020. Increased social media use was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms regardless of other theoretical moderators or confounders of mental health (e.g., demographics, school status, importance of technology, COVID-19-related stress). Despite literature suggesting that remote learning may result in adverse mental health outcomes, we did not find local school reopening to be associated with current depressive/anxiety symptoms, nor with COVID-19-related increases in technology use. Self-reported use of social media for coping purposes moderated the association between increased social media use and mental health symptoms; in other words, some social media use may have positive effects. Although much prior research has focused on social media use as a marker of stress, we also found that increased video gaming and TV/movie watching were also associated with internalizing symptoms, in accordance with others' work.

302,Elicitation of broadly protective sarbecovirus immunity by receptor-binding domain nanoparticle vaccines,"Understanding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited antibodies to neutralize and protect against emerging variants of concern and other sarbecoviruses is key for guiding vaccine development decisions and public health policies. We show that a clinical stage multivalent SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain nanoparticle vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP) protects mice from SARS-CoV-2-induced disease after a single shot, indicating that the vaccine could allow dose-sparing. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP elicits high antibody titers in two non-human primate (NHP) models against multiple distinct RBD antigenic sites known to be recognized by neutralizing antibodies. We benchmarked NHP serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NP against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen using a panel of single-residue spike mutants detected in clinical isolates as well as the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are resilient to most RBD mutations tested, but the E484K substitution has similar negative consequences for neutralization, and exhibit modest but comparable neutralization breadth against distantly related sarbecoviruses. We demonstrate that mosaic and cocktail sarbecovirus RBD-NPs elicit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, including against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, and protect mice against severe SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of the SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine.

303,Cluster Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Gene using Deep Learning Autoencoder: Gene Profiling for Mutations and Transitions,"We report on a method for analyzing the variant of coronavirus genes using autoencoder.

The method using autoencoder meets this requirement and is suitable for understanding how and when the variants emarge and disappear. For the over 30,000 SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene sequences sampled globally from December 2019 to February 2021, we were able to represent a summary of their characteristics in a 3D plot and show the expansion, decline, and transformation of the virus types over time and by region. Based on ORF1ab genes, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses were classified into five major types (A, B, C, D, and E in the order of appearance): the virus type that originated in China at the end of 2019 (type A) practically disappeared in June 2020; two virus types (types B and C) have emerged in the United States and Europe since February 2020, and type B has become a global phenomenon.

304,Design and proof-of-concept for targeted phage-based COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a streamlined cold-free supply chain,"Development of effective vaccines against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global imperative. Rapid immunization of the world human population against a widespread, continually evolving, and highly pathogenic virus is an unprecedented challenge, and many different vaccine approaches are being pursued to meet this task. Engineered filamentous bacteriophage (phage) have unique potential in vaccine development due to their inherent immunogenicity, genetic plasticity, stability, cost-effectiveness for large-scale production, and proven safety profile in humans. Herein we report the design, development, and initial evaluation of targeted phage-based vaccination approaches against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by using dual ligand peptide-targeted phage and adeno-associated virus/phage (AAVP) particles. Towards a unique phage- and AAVP-based dual-display candidate approach, we first performed structure-guided antigen design to select six solvent-exposed epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein for display on the recombinant major capsid coat protein pVIII. Targeted phage particles carrying one of these epitopes induced a strong and specific humoral response. In an initial experimental approach, when these targeted phage particles were further genetically engineered to simultaneously display a ligand peptide (CAKSMGDIVC) on the minor capsid protein pIII, which enables receptor-mediated transport of phage particles from the lung epithelium into the systemic circulation (termed ""dual-display""), they enhanced a systemic and specific spike (S) protein-specific antibody response upon aerosolization into the lungs of mice. In a second line of investigation, we engineered targeted AAVP particles to deliver the entire S protein gene under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which induced tissue-specific transgene expression stimulating a systemic S protein-specific antibody response. As proof-of-concept preclinical experiments, we show that targeted phage- and AAVP-based particles serve as robust yet versatile enabling platforms for ligand-directed immunization and promptly yield COVID-19 vaccine prototypes for further translational development.

SignificanceThe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has accounted for over 2.5 million deaths and an unprecedented impact on the health of mankind worldwide. Over the past several months, while a few COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization and are currently being administered to the entire human population, the demand for prompt global immunization has created enormous logistical challenges--including but not limited to supply, access, and distribution--that justify and reinforce the research for additional strategic alternatives. Phage are viruses that only infect bacteria and have been safely administered to humans as antibiotics for decades. As experimental proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that aerosol pulmonary vaccination with lung-targeted phage particles that display short epitopes of the S protein on the capsid as well as preclinical vaccination with targeted AAVP particles carrying the S protein gene elicit a systemic and specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompetent mice. Given that targeted phage- and AAVP-based viral particles are sturdy yet simple to genetically engineer, cost-effective for rapid large-scale production in clinical grade, and relatively stable at room temperature, such unique attributes might perhaps become additional tools towards COVID-19 vaccine design and development for immediate and future unmet needs.",Daniela I.

305,DNA spike-ins enable confident interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from amplicon-based sequencing,"The rapid global spread and continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted an unprecedented need for viral genomic surveillance and clinical viral sequencing. Amplicon-based sequencing methods provide a sensitive, low-cost and rapid approach but suffer a high potential for contamination, which can undermine lab processes and results. This challenge will only increase with expanding global production of sequences by diverse research groups for epidemiological and clinical interpretation. We present an approach which uses synthetic DNA spike-ins (SDSIs) to track samples and detect inter-sample contamination through a sequencing workflow. Applying this approach to the ARTIC Consortiums amplicon design, we define a series of best practices for Illumina-based sequencing and provide a detailed characterization of approaches to increase sensitivity for low-viral load samples incorporating the SDSIs. We demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the SDSI method amidst a real-time investigation of a suspected hospital cluster of SARS-CoV-2 cases.",Kim A. Lagerborg; Erica Normandin; Matthew R.

306,3D genomic capture of regulatory immuno-genetic profiles in COVID-19 patients for prognosis of severe COVID disease outcome,"Human infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A striking characteristic of COVID-19 infection in humans is the highly variable host response and the diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from clinically asymptomatic to severe immune reactions leading to hospitalization and death. Here we used a 3D genomic approach to analyse blood samples at the time of COVID diagnosis, from a global cohort of 80 COVID-19 patients, with different degrees of clinical disease outcomes. Using 3D whole genome EpiSwitch(R) arrays to generate over 1 million data points per patient, we identified a distinct and measurable set of differences in genomic organization at immune-related loci that demonstrated prognostic power at baseline to stratify patients with mild forms of illness and those with severe forms that required hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) support. Further analysis revealed both well established and new COVID-related dysregulated pathways and loci, including innate and adaptive immunity; ACE2; olfactory, G{beta}{psi}, Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) signalling; prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the acute inflammatory cytokine CCL3, and the T-cell derived chemotactic cytokine CCL5. We identified potential therapeutic agents for mitigation of severe disease outcome, with several already being tested independently, including mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and tacrolimus) and general immunosuppressants (dexamethasone and hydrocortisone). Machine learning algorithms based on established EpiSwitch(R) methodology further identified a subset of 3D genomic changes that could be used as prognostic molecular biomarker leads for the development of a COVID-19 disease severity test.",Ewan Hunter; Christina Koutsothanasi; Adam Wilson; Francisco Coroado Santos; Matthew Salter; Ryan Powell; Ann Dring; Paulina Brajer; Benedict Egan; Jurjen Westra; Aroul Ramadass; William Messner; Amanda Brunton; Zoe Lyski; Rama Vancheeswaran; Andrew Barlow; Dmitri Pchejetski; Alexandre Akoulitchev,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435295,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435295,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
307,Immunoinformatic Approach for the identification of T Cell and B Cell Epitopes in the Surface Glycoprotein and Designing a Potent Multiepitope Vaccine Construct Against SARS-CoV-2 including the new UK variant,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus in China in late 2019 has turned into a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affecting several millions of people worldwide in a short span of time with high fatality. The crisis is further aggravated by the emergence and evolution of new variant SARS-CoV-2 strains in UK during December, 2020 followed by their transmission to other countries. A major concern is that prophylaxis and therapeutics are not available yet to control and prevent the virus which is spreading at an alarming rate, though several vaccine trials are in the final stage. As vaccines are developed through various strategies, their immunogenic potential may drastically vary and thus pose several challenges in offering both arms of immunity such as humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the virus. In this study, we adopted an immunoinformatics-aided identification of B cell and T cell epitopes in the Spike protein, which is a surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, for developing a new Multiepitope vaccine construct (MEVC). MEVC has 575 amino acids and comprises adjuvants and various cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes that possess the highest affinity for the respective HLA alleles, assembled and joined by linkers. The computational data suggest that the MEVC is non-toxic, non-allergenic and thermostable with the capability to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The population coverage of various countries affected by COVID-19 with respect to the selected B and T cell epitopes in MEVC was also investigated. Subsequently, the biological activity of MEVC was assessed by bioinformatic tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptors TLR3 and TLR4. The epitopes of the construct were analyzed with that of the strains belonging to various clades including the new variant UK strain having multiple unique mutations in S protein. Due to the advantageous features, the MEVC can be tested in vitro for more practical validation and the study offers immense scope for developing a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 in view of the public health emergency associated with COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.",Kaveri Krishnasamy; Gracy Fathima Selvaraj; Kiruba Ramesh; Padmaoriya Padmanabhan; Vidya Gopalan; Karthikeyan Govindan; Aswathi Chandran; Srinivasan Sivasubramanian,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435391,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435391,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
308,phastSim: efficient simulation of sequence evolution for pandemic-scale datasets,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSequence simulators are fundamental tools in bioinformatics, as they allow us to test data processing and inference tools, as well as being part of some inference methods. The ongoing surge in available sequence data is however testing the limits of our bioinformatics software. One example is the large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, which are beyond the processing power of many methods, and simulating such large datasets is also proving difficult. Here we present a new algorithm and software for efficiently simulating sequence evolution along extremely large trees (e.g. > 100, 000 tips) when the branches of the tree are short, as is typical in genomic epidemiology. Our algorithm is based on the Gillespie approach, and implements an efficient multi-layered search tree structure that provides high computational efficiency by taking advantage of the fact that only a small proportion of the genome is likely to mutate at each branch of the considered phylogeny. Our open source software is available from https://github.com/NicolaDM/phastSim and allows easy integration with other Python packages as well as a variety of evolutionary models, including new ones that we developed to more realistically model SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution.",Nicola De Maio; Lukas Weilguny; Conor R Walker; Yatish Turakhia; Russell Corbett-Detig; Nick Goldman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435416,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435416,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
309,Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease inhibitors through a combination of high-throughput screening and FlipGFP-based reporter assay,"The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. PLpro is involved in the cleavage of viral polyproteins and antagonizing host innate immune response through its deubiquitinating and deISG15ylating activities, rendering it a high profile antiviral drug target. Through a FRET-based high-throughput screening, several hits were identified as PLpro inhibitors with IC50 values at the single-digit micromolar range. Subsequent lead optimization led to potent inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 0.56 to 0.90 {micro}M. To help prioritize lead compounds for the cellular antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-2, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP assay that is suitable for quantifying the intracellular enzymatic inhibition potency of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting. Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP-PLpro assay, Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 hACE2 cells with EC50 values of 8.89 and 8.32 {micro}M, respectively, which were 3-fold more potent than GRL0617 (EC50 = 25.1 {micro}M). The X-ray crystal structures of PLpro in complex with GRL0617 showed that binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 induced a conformational change in the BL2 loop to the more closed conformation. Overall, the PLpro inhibitors identified in this study represent promising starting points for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, and FlipGFP-PLpro assay might be a suitable surrogate for screening PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting.",Zilei Xia; Michael Sacco; Chunlong Ma; Julia Townsend; Naoya Kitamura; Yanmei Hu; Mandy Ba; Tommy Szeto; Xiujun Zhang; Xiangzhi Meng; Fushun Zhang; Yan Xiang; Michael Marty; Yu Chen; Jun Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435551,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435551,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
310,Circular RNA Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and Emerging Variants,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. The emerging variants B.1.1.7 in the UK, B.1.351 in South Africa, and P.1 in Brazil have recently spread rapidly, arousing concerns about the efficacy of the current vaccines and antibody therapies. Therefore, there is still a high demand for alternative vaccines with great efficacy, high design flexibility, and fast manufacturing speed. Here, we reported a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that encodes the trimeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Being a circularized RNA molecule, circRNARBD could be rapidly produced via in vitro transcription and is highly stable without nucleotide modification. Lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated circRNARBD elicited potent and sustained neutralizing antibodies, as well as Th1-biased T cell responses in mice. Notably, antibodies from mice immunized with circRNA encoding RBD variant (K417N-E484K-501Y) effectively neutralized B.1.351 variant. Moreover, we developed therapeutic circRNAs, encoding SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies or hACE2 decoys, which could effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Our study suggests that circular RNA holds the potential to become a novel vaccine and therapeutic platform.",Liang Qu; Zongyi Yi; Yong Shen; Yiyuan Xu; Zeguang Wu; Huixian Tang; Xia Xiao; Xiaojing Dong; Li Guo; Ayijiang Yisimayi; Yunlong Cao; Zhuo Zhou; Jianwei Wang; Xiaoliang Sunney Xie; Wensheng Wei,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435594,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.435594,2021-03-16,2021-03-16,,False
311,Killed whole genome-reduced bacteria surface-expressed coronavirus fusion peptide vaccines protect against disease in a porcine model,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rages on, it is important to explore new evolution-resistant vaccine antigens and new vaccine platforms that can produce readily scalable, inexpensive vaccines with easier storage and transport. We report here a synthetic biology-based vaccine platform that employs an expression vector with an inducible Gram-negative autotransporter to express vaccine antigens on surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance interaction of vaccine antigen with immune system. As a proof of principle, we utilized genome-reduced E. coli to express SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) fusion peptide (FP) on the cell surface, and evaluated their use as a killed whole cell vaccine. The FP sequence is highly conserved across coronaviruses; the 6 FP core amino acid residues along with the 4 adjacent residues upstream and the 3 residues downstream the core are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. We tested the efficacy of PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines in a PEDV challenge pig model. We demonstrated that both vaccines induced potent anamnestic responses upon virus challenge, potentiated IFN-{gamma} responses, reduced viral RNA loads in jejunum tissue, and provided significant protection against clinical disease. However, neither vaccines elicited sterilizing immunity. Since SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines provided similar clinical protection, the coronavirus FP could be a target for a broadly-protective vaccine using any platform. Importantly, the genome-reduced bacterial surface-expressed vaccine platform, when using a vaccine appropriate bacterial vector, has potential utility as an inexpensive, readily manufactured, and rapid vaccine platform for other pathogens.

Significance StatementWe report a new vaccine platform to express vaccine antigens on surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. We demonstrated the utility of this vaccine platform by expressing the highly conserved fusion peptide (FP) of SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus on the surface of E.coli to produce killed whole cell bacterial vaccines. The vaccine primes a potent anamnestic response, potentiates IFN-{gamma} responses, and provides significant protection in pigs against disease following virus challenge. The FP could be a target for a broadly-protective coronavirus vaccine since a Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine provided cross-protection against Alphacoronavirus PEDV. When using a vaccine appropriate bacteria vector, this inexpensive new vaccine platform offers the potential for use in developing countries.",Denicar Lina Nascimento Fabris Maeda; Debin Tian; Hanna Yu; Nakul Dar; Vignesh Rajasekaran; Sarah Meng; Hassan Mahsoub; Harini Sooryanarain; Bo Wang; C.

312,"Replication kinetic, cell tropism and associated immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 virus infected human iPSC derived neural models","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with a wide variety of neurological complications. Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and spread, despite ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NPR1 expression in all cultures. However, this sparse infection did result in the production of type-III-interferons and IL-8. In contrast, H5N1 virus replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the CNS.",Lisa Bauer; Bas Lendemeijer; Lonneke Leijten; Carmen W.

313,Rationally designed immunogens enable immune focusing to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif,"Eliciting antibodies to surface-exposed viral glycoproteins can lead to protective responses that ultimately control and prevent future infections. Targeting functionally conserved epitopes may help reduce the likelihood of viral escape and aid in preventing the spread of related viruses with pandemic potential. One such functionally conserved viral epitope is the site to which a receptor must bind to facilitate viral entry. Here, we leveraged rational immunogen design strategies to focus humoral responses to the receptor binding motif (RBM) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Using glycan engineering and epitope scaffolding, we find an improved targeting of the serum response to the RBM in context of SARS-CoV-2 spike imprinting. Furthermore, we observed a robust SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing serum response with increased potency against related sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV and WIV1-CoV. Thus, RBM focusing is a promising strategy to elicit breadth across emerging sarbecoviruses and represents an adaptable design approach for targeting conserved epitopes on other viral glycoproteins.

314,Shed the light on virus: virucidal effects of 405 nm visible light on SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.,"Germicidal potential of specific wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum is an area of growing interest. While ultra-violet (UV) based technologies have shown satisfactory virucidal potential, the photo-toxicity in humans coupled with UV associated polymer degradation limit its use in occupied spaces. Alternatively, longer wavelengths with less irradiation energy such as visible light (405 nm) have largely been explored in the context of bactericidal and fungicidal applications. Such studies indicated that 405 nm mediated inactivation is caused by the absorbance of porphyrins within the organism creating reactive oxygen species which result in free radical damage to its DNA and disruption of cellular functions. The virucidal potential of visible-light based technologies has been largely unexplored and speculated to be not effective given the lack of porphyrins in viruses. The current study demonstrated increased susceptibility of lipid-enveloped respiratory pathogens of importance such as SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) as well as the influenza A virus to 405nm, visible light in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers, indicating a potential porphyrin-independent alternative mechanism of visible light mediated viral inactivation. Given that visible light is generally safe to humans, our results support further exploration of the use of visible light technology for the application of continuous decontamination in areas within hospitals and/or infectious disease laboratories, specifically for the inactivation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A.",Clifford J Yahnke; Raveen J Rathnasinghe; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435337,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435337,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
315,Impact of School Reopening on Pandemic Spread: A Case Study using an Agent-Based Model for COVID-19,"This article examines the impact of partial/full reopening of school/college campuses on the spread of a pandemic using COVID-19 as a case study. The study uses an agent-based simulation model that replicates community spread in an urban region of U.S.A. via daily social mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the models behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15 %) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.",Hanisha Anand Tatapudi; Tapas K Das,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253485,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253485,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,True
316,The local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults,"While a substantial proportion of adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 progress to develop severe disease, children rarely manifest respiratory complications. Therefore, understanding differences in the local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults may provide important clues about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we first generated a healthy reference multi-omics single cell data set from children (n=30) in whom we have profiled triple matched samples: nasal and tracheal brushings and PBMCs, where we track the developmental changes for 42 airway and 31 blood cell populations from infancy, through childhood to adolescence. This has revealed the presence of naive B and T lymphocytes in neonates and infants with a unique gene expression signature bearing hallmarks of innate immunity. We then contrast the healthy reference with equivalent data from severe paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients (total n=27), from the same three types of samples: upper and lower airways and blood. We found striking differences: children with COVID-19 as opposed to adults had a higher proportion of innate lymphoid and non-clonally expanded naive T cells in peripheral blood, and a limited interferon-response signature. In the airway epithelium, we found the highest viral load in goblet and ciliated cells and describe a novel inflammatory epithelial cell population. These cells represent a transitional regenerative state between secretory and ciliated cells; they were found in healthy children and were enriched in paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients. Epithelial cells display an antiviral and neutrophil-recruiting gene signature that is weaker in severe paediatric versus adult COVID-19. Our matched blood and airway samples allowed us to study the spatial dynamics of infection. Lastly, we provide a user-friendly interface for this data1 as a highly granular reference for the study of immune responses in airways and blood in children.",Masahiro Yoshida; Kaylee B Worlock; Ni Huang; Rik GH Lindeboom; Colin R Butler; Natsuhiko Kumasaka; Cecilia Dominguez Conde; Lira Mamanova; Liam Bolt; Laura Richardson; Krzysztof Polanski; Elo Madissoon; Josephine L Barnes; Jessica Allen-Hyttinen; Eliz Kilich; Brendan C Jones; Angus de Wilton; Anna Wilbrey-Clark; Waradon Sungnak; Jan Patrick Prett; Elena Prigmore; Henry Yung; Puja Mehta; Aarash Saleh; Anita Saigal; Vivian Chu; Jonathan M Cohen; Clare Cane; Aikaterini Iordanidou; Soichi Shibuya; Ann-Kathrin Reuschl; A.

317,Monitoring the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Tenerife (Spain) since mid-December 2020,"Starting in December 2020, a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases occurred in Tenerife compared to the rest of the Canary Islands (Spain). Because of the direct touristic connections between Tenerife and the UK, and the rapid transmission and dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC-202012/01) by the end of November 2020 in South England, here we measured the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases occurring between the 18th of December 2020 and the 25th of February 2021. Out of the 2,091 COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples assessed, 226 showed a spike gene target failure (SGTF). Subsequent viral genome sequencing further confirmed that 93.2% of them corresponded to the B.1.1.7 lineage. Furthermore, a rapid increase in the proportion of SGTF variants was detected in up to 10.7% of positive cases during the Christmas season despite stricter measures for containing the transmission were imposed in Tenerife in the period.

318,Persisting Salivary IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at 9 Months After Mild COVID-19: A Complementary Approach to Population Surveys,"BackgroundDeclining humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients and possibility of reinfections has raised concern. Mucosal immunity particularly salivary antibodies could be short-lived. However, long-term studies are sparse.

MethodsUsing a multiplex bead-based array platform, we investigated antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in 256 saliva samples from convalescent patients 1-9 months after symptomatic COVID-19 (n=74, Cohort 1), undiagnosed individuals with self-reported questionnaires (n=147, Cohort 2), and individuals sampled pre-pandemic time (n= 35, Cohort 3).

ResultsSalivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to 9 month recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At 9 months, IgG remained in saliva in majority as seen in blood serology. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments.

ConclusionsUnlike SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA that appeared short-lived, the specific IgG in saliva appears stable even after mild COVID-19 as noted for blood serology. The non-invasive saliva-based SARS-Cov-2 antibody testing with self-collection at homes may thus serve as a complementary alternative to conventional blood serology.",Hassan Alkharaan; Shaghayegh Bayati; Cecilia Hellstrom; Annika Olsson; Karin Lindahl; Gordana Bogdanovic; Soo Aleman; Georgios Tsilingaridis; Patricia De Palma; Sophia Hober; Anna Manberg; Peter Nilsson; Elisa Pin; Margaret Sallberg Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253492,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253492,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,True
319,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 N-terminal domain dimerizes and harbors autonomously folded elements,"The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein is a critical component of the RNA replicase, as its N-terminal domain (NTD) anchors Nsp12, the RNA, and Nsp13. Whereas its C-terminal domain (CTD) structure is well resolved, there is an open debate regarding the conformation adopted by the NTD as it is predicted as disordered but found in a variety of complex-dependent conformations or missing from many other structures. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the SARS CoV-2 Nsp8 NTD features both well folded secondary structure and disordered segments. Our results suggest that while part of this domain corresponding to two long -helices forms autonomously, the folding of other segments would require interaction with other replicase components. When isolated, the -helix population progressively declines towards the C-termini, and dynamics measurements indicate that the Nsp8 NTD behaves as a dimer under our conditions.",Miguel Á Treviño; David Pantoja-Uceda; Douglas Vinson Laurents; Miguel Mompeán,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435186,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435186,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
320,SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION OF COVID-19 MITIGATION (SOCOM): ASSESSING FACE COVERING AND DISTANCING IN SCHOOLS,"IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall of 2020. Physical distancing and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, no research has focused on mitigation strategy adherence during school days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM).

MethodsWe extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop the SOCOM training and implementation protocol to assess physical distancing and face covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs).

ResultsFor the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with more activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were ideal for accurately capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing (90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level (87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with [&ge;]20 students.

ConclusionsMillions of children throughout the US are likely to return to school in the months ahead despite the current surge of COVID-19 cases.

323,HIV service interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: the role of HIV service challenges and institutional response from healthcare professional's perspective,"BackgroundThe healthcare system in China was largely overwhelmed during the unprecedented pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). HIV-related services have been unavoidably interrupted and impacted. However, the nature and scope of HIV service interruptions due to COVID-19 has rarely been characterized in China and how HIV service challenges affect the service interruptions are also unclear. The current study aimed at characterize HIV service interruption levels and analyzed its associated factors related to service challenges and institutional response from HIV healthcare providers viewpoint.

MethodsA cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1,029 HIV healthcare providers in Guangxi, China, from April to May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was first used to identify HIV service interruption levels. Then hierarchical multinomial logistic regression was conducted to analyze the relationships of HIV care service challenges and institutional response with HIV service interruption levels. Simple slope analysis was employed to examine interaction effects between HIV service challenges and institutional response to COVID-19.

ResultsFour classes of HIV service interruption were identified using LCA, with 22.0% complete interruption (class 1), 15.4% moderate interruption (class 2), 21.9% minor interruption (class 3) and 40.7% almost no interruption (class 4). Using class 4 as a reference group, HIV care service challenges were positively associated with the probabilities of service interruptions (Class 1: AOR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.19[~]1.26; Class 2: AOR= 1.10, 95%CI: 1.08[~]1.13; Class 3: AOR= 1.10, 95%CI: 1.08[~]1.12). Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery was negatively associated with the probabilities of being classified into Class 1 (""Complete interruption"") (AOR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.93[~]1.00) and Class 3 (""minor interruption [Outreach service]"") (AOR=0.96, 95%CI: 0.93[~]0.99) as compared to Class 4 (""almost no interruption""). Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery moderated the association of HIV service challenges with complete interruption, but not with the moderate or minor interruption when comparing with no interruption group.

ConclusionsA substantial HIV service interruptions occurs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly services that require face-to-face interactions, such as VCT counselling, follow up and outreach services. HIV service challenges largely hinder the HIV service delivery. Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery could marginally buffer the negative effect of service challenges on complete HIV service interruptions.

325,A novel soluble ACE2 protein totally protects from lethal disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses full-length angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is membrane bound, as its initial cell contact receptor preceding viral entry. Here we report a human soluble ACE2 variant fused with a 5kD albumin binding domain (ABD) and bridged via a dimerization motif hinge-like 4-cysteine dodecapeptide, which we term ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD. This protein is enzymatically active, has increased duration of action in vivo conferred by the ABD-tag, and displays 20-30-fold higher binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain than its des-DDC monomeric form (ACE2 1-618-ABD) due to DDC-linked dimerization. ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD was administered for 3 consecutive days to transgenic k18-hACE2 mice, a model that develops lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection, to evaluate the preclinical preventative/ therapeutic value for COVID-19. Mice treated with ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD developed a mild to moderate disease for the first few days assessed by a clinical score and modest weight loss. The untreated control animals, by contrast, became severely ill and had to be sacrificed by day 6/7 and lung histology revealed extensive pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage and mononuclear infiltrates. At 6 days, mortality was totally prevented in the treated group, lung histopathology was improved and viral titers markedly reduced.

326,A map of direct SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions implicates specific human host processes,"Key steps in viral propagation, immune suppression, and pathology are mediated by direct, binary, physical interactions between viral and host proteins. To understand the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we generated an unbiased systematic map of binary interactions between viral and host proteins, complementing previous co-complex association maps by conveying more direct mechanistic understanding and potentially enabling targeted disruption of direct interactions. To this end, we deployed two parallel strategies, identifying 205 virus-host and 27 intraviral binary interactions amongst 171 host and 19 viral proteins, and confirming high quality of these interactions via a calibrated orthogonal assay. Host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are enriched in various cellular processes, including immune signaling and inflammation, protein ubiquitination, and membrane trafficking. Specific subnetworks provide new hypotheses related to viral modulation of host protein homeostasis and T-cell regulation. The binary virus-host protein interactions we identified can now be prioritized as targets for therapeutic intervention.

327,Differential gene expression by RNA-Seq in Sigma-2 Receptor/TMEM97 knockout cells reveals its role in complement activation and SARS-CoV-2 viral uptake,"Our lab has recently shown that the Sigma-2 Receptor/Transmembrane Protein 97 (sigma-2R/TMEM97) interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and facilitates the enhanced uptake of various ligands including lipoproteins and intrinsically disordered proteins. TMEM97 has been recently been shown to interact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins, highlighting its potential involvement with viral entry into the cell. We hypothesized that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may play a role in facilitating viral uptake, and with the regulation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways that are involved with viral infection. In this study, we identified the top differentially expressed genes upon the knockout of sigma-2R/TMEM97, and analyzed the genes involved with the inflammatory and thrombotic cascades, effects that are observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the ablation of sigma-2R/TMEM97 resulted in an increase in Complement Component 4 Binding Protein (C4BP) proteins, at both the translational and transcriptional levels. We also showed that sigma-2R/TMEM97 interacts with the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, forming a protein complex, and that disruption of this complex results in the inhibition of viral uptake. The results of this study suggest that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may be a novel therapeutic target to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral uptake, as well as to decrease inflammatory and thrombotic effects through the modulation of the complement cascade.",Aladdin Riad; Yann Aubert; Chenbo Zeng; Thomas J.

328,"Structure, Mechanism and Crystallographic fragment screening of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase","The global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has infected over 100 million and caused over 2 million fatalities worldwide at the point of writing. There is currently a lack of effective drugs to treat people infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) is a superfamily1B helicase that has been identified as a possible target for anti-viral drugs due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. In this study we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP). Comparisons of these structures reveal details of global and local conformational changes that are induced by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. Structural analysis reveals two pockets on NSP13 that are classified as ""druggable"" and include one of the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. To identify possible starting points for anti-viral drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase. The fragment screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets, with hot spots in pockets predicted to be of functional importance, including the druggable nucleotide and nucleic acid binding sites, opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.",Joseph A Newman; Alice Douangamath; Setayesh Yazdani; Yuliana Yosaatmadja; Anthony Aimon; Jose Brandao-Neto; Louise Dunnett; Tyler Gorrie-Stone; Rachael Skyner; Daren Fearon; Matthieu Schapira; Frank von Delft; Opher Gileadi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435326,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435326,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
329,S-acylation controls SARS-Cov-2 membrane lipid organization and enhances infectivity,"SARS-CoV-2 virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer which contains membrane proteins such as Spike, responsible for target-cell binding and virus fusion, the envelope protein E and the accessory protein Orf3a. Here, we show that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, all three proteins become lipid modified, through action of the S-acyltransferase ZDHHC20. Particularly striking is the rapid acylation of Spike on 10 cytosolic cysteines within the ER and Golgi. Using a combination of computational, lipidomics and biochemical approaches, we show that this massive lipidation controls Spike biogenesis and degradation, and drives the formation of localized ordered cholesterol and sphingolipid rich lipid nanodomains, in the early Golgi where viral budding occurs. ZDHHC20-mediated acylation allows the formation of viruses with enhanced fusion capacity and overall infectivity.

An understanding of the antibody/S escape mutations landscape is urgently needed to preemptively address this threat. Here we describe a rapid method to identify escape mutants for nAbs targeting the S receptor binding site. We identified escape mutants for five nAbs, including three from the public germline class VH3-53 elicited by natural COVID-19 infection. Escape mutations predominantly mapped to the periphery of the ACE2 recognition site on the RBD with K417, D420, Y421, F486, and Q493 as notable hotspots.

331,Effects of Mutations in the Receptor-Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike on its Binding Affinity to ACE2 and Neutralizing Antibodies Revealed by Computational Analysis,"SARS-CoV-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the most deleterious pandemics of our time. The interaction between the ACE2 receptors at the surface of human cells and the viral Spike (S) protein triggers the infection making the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein a focal target for the neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Despite the recent progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, the emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to Abs produced in response to the vaccine administration and/or monoclonal ones represents upcoming jeopardy. Here, we assessed the possible effects of single and multiple mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein on its binding energy to various antibodies and the human ACE2 receptor. The performed computational analysis indicates that while single amino acid replacements in RBD may only cause partial impairment of the Abs binding, moreover, limited to specific epitopes, some variants of SARS-CoV-2 (with as few as 8 mutations), which are already present in the population, may potentially result in a much broader antigenic escape. We also identified a number of point mutations, which, in contrast to the majority of replacements, reduce RBD affinity to various antibodies without affecting its binding to ACE2. Overall, the results provide guidelines for further experimental studies aiming at the identification of the high-risk RBD mutations allowing for an antigenic escape.",Marine E Bozdaganyan; Olga S Sokolova; Konstantin V Shaitan; Mikhail P Kirpichnikov; Philipp S Orekhov,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435322,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435322,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
332,BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine induces antibodies of broader cross-reactivity than natural infection but recognition of mutant viruses is up to 10-fold reduced,"BackgroundSeveral new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged since fall 2020 which have multiple mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein.

ObjectiveWe aimed to assess how mutations in RBD affected recognition of immune sera by antibodies induced by natural infection versus immunization with BNT162b2, a mRNA-based vaccine against COVID-19.

MethodsWe produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants with single mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region (E484K, K417N, N501Y) or with all 3 mutations combined, as occurring in the newly emerged variants B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Using standard and avidity ELISAs, we determined the binding capacities to mutant RBDs of antibodies induced by infection versus vaccination.

ResultsThese binding assays showed that vaccination induced antibodies recognize both wildtype and mutant RBDs with higher avidities than those raised by infection. Nevertheless, recognition of mutants RBDK417N and RBDN501Y was 2.5-3-fold reduced while RBDE484K and the triple mutant were 10-fold less well recognized, demonstrating that the mutation at position 484 was key for the observed loss in cross-reactivity.

ConclusionOur binding data demonstrate improved recognition of mutant viruses by BNT162b2-induced antibodies compared to those induced by natural infection. Recognition may, however, be 10-fold reduced for the variants B.1.351/P.1, suggesting that the development of a new vaccine is warranted. The E484K mutation is an key hurdle for immune recognition, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy as well as serological assays based on the wildtype sequence may therefore seriously impaired.

333,Antibody evasion by the Brazilian P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2,"Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K, K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation.

334,Structural basis for backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex,"Backtracking, the reverse motion of the transcriptase enzyme on the nucleic acid template, is a universal regulatory feature of transcription in cellular organisms but its role in viruses is not established. Here we present evidence that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein crosslinking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3-segment of the product-RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product-RNA 3-end frays and enters the NTP-entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking. Backtracking may aid proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against antivirals.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated and transcribed by its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the target for antivirals such as remdesivir. We use a combination of approaches to show that backtracking (backwards motion of the RdRp on the template RNA) is a feature of SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription.

SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells are initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection. Here, we found that clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and metabolic disorder in human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Among 13 approved drugs that we have previously identified as potential inhibitor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, clomipramine showed the best potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-stimulated ACE2 internalization. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection to human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) and TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells were dramatically suppressed even after treatment with clomipramine. Furthermore, the combined use of clomipramine and remdesivir was revealed to synergistically suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19.

DesignRandomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted from April 21st to November 27th, 2020.

SettingFive hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

ParticipantsHospitalized patients aged [&ge;]18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, infiltrates on chest imaging and oxygen saturation [&le;] 94% on room air or requirement for supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

InterventionParticipants were randomized 2:1 to a single transfusion of either 1 unit of convalescent or normal control plasma.

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.

ResultsOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in clinical status was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (with an odds ratio (OR) of a 1-point improvement in the scale: 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.68, p=0.180).

However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples (n=40) from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected. Serious adverse events occurred in 39/147 (27%) participants who received convalescent plasma and 26/72 (36%) participants who received control plasma.

LimitationsSome participants did not receive high-titer convalescent plasma.

ConclusionIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in 28 days clinical status. The significant reduction in mortality associated with convalescent plasma, however, may warrant further evaluation.

337,"COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Hesitancy in Low and Middle Income Countries, and Implications for Messaging","BackgroundAs vaccination campaigns are deployed worldwide, addressing vaccine hesitancy is of critical importance to ensure sufficient immunization coverage. We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 samples covering ten low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America, and two higher income countries (Russia and the United States).

MethodsStandardized survey responses were collected from  45,928 individuals between June 2020 and January 2021. We estimate vaccine acceptance with robust standard errors clustered at the study level. We analyze stated reasons for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, and the most trusted sources for advice on vaccination, and we disaggregate acceptance rates by gender, age, and education level.

FindingsWe document willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, ranging from 67% (Burkina Faso) to 97% (Nepal). Willingness was considerably higher in LMICs (80%) than in the United States (65%) and Russia (30%). Vaccine acceptance was primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against the disease (91%). Concern about side effects (40%) was the most common reason for reluctance. Health workers were considered the most trusted sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines.

InterpretationGiven high levels of stated willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, our study suggests that prioritizing efficient and equitable vaccine distribution to LMICs will yield high returns in promoting immunization on a global scale. Messaging and other community-level interventions in these contexts should be designed to help translate intentions into uptake, and emphasize safety and efficacy. Trusted health workers are ideally positioned to deliver these messages.

338,Predictive and Causal Analysis of No-Shows for Medical Exams During COVID-19: A Case Study of Breast Imaging in a Nationwide Israeli Health Organization,"""No-shows"", defined as missed appointments or late cancellations, is a central problem in healthcare systems. It has appeared to intensify during the COVID-19 pandemic and the nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as closures, taken to slow its spread. No-shows interfere with patients continuous care, lead to inefficient utilization of medical resources, and increase healthcare costs. We present a comprehensive analysis of no-shows for breast imaging appointments made during 2020 in a large medical network in Israel. We applied advanced machine learning methods to provide insights into novel and known predictors. Additionally, we employed causal inference methodology to infer the effect of closures on no-shows, after accounting for confounding biases, and demonstrate the superiority of adversarial balancing over inverse probability weighting in correcting these biases. Our results imply that a patients perceived risk of cancer and the COVID-19 time-based factors are major predictors. Further, we reveal that closures impact patients over 60, but not patients undergoing advanced diagnostic examinations.",Michal Ozery-Flato; Ora Pinchasov; Miel Dabush-Kasa; Efrat Hexter; Gabriel Chodick; Michal Guindy; Michal Rosen-Zvi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253358,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253358,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
339,Rapid implementation of a cohort for the study of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19,"BACKGROUNDAs the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues and millions remain vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), attention has turned to characterizing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

METHODSFrom April 21 to December 31, 2020, we assembled a cohort of consecutive volunteers who a) had documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positivity; b) were [&ge;] 2 weeks past onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first test for SARS-CoV-2; and c) were able to travel to our site in San Francisco. Participants learned about the study by being identified on medical center-based registries and being notified or by responding to advertisements. At 4-month intervals, we asked participants about physical symptoms that were new or worse compared to the period prior to COVID-19, mental health symptoms and quality of life. We described 4 time periods: 1) acute illness (0-3 weeks), 2) early recovery (3-10 weeks), 3) late recovery 1 (12-20 weeks), and 4) late recovery 2 (28-36 weeks). Blood and oral specimens were collected at each visit.

RESULTSWe have, to date, enrolled 179 adults. During acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 had been asymptomatic, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. In the acute phase, the most common symptoms were fatigue, fever, myalgia, cough and anosmia/dysgeusia. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were the most commonly reported symptoms, but a variety of others were endorsed by at least some participants. Some experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with ambulation and performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale value rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months (80, interquartile range [IQR]: 70-90; and 80, IQR 75-90) compared to prior to COVID-19 (85; IQR 75-90). Biospecimens were collected at nearly 600 participant-visits.

CONCLUSIONAmong a cohort of participants enrolled in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found many with persistent physical symptoms through 8 months following onset of COVID-19 with an impact on self-rated overall health. The presence of participants with and without symptoms and ample biological specimens will facilitate study of PASC pathogenesis. Similar evaluations in a population-representative sample will be needed to estimate the population-level prevalence of PASC.",Michael J. Peluso; J. Daniel Kelly; Scott Lu; Sarah A.

340,New SARS-CoV-2 lineages could evade CD8+ T-cells response,"BackgroundMany SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have emerged since the Covid-19 outburst, notably the lineages detected in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However, not enough attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of infection by new lineages.

MethodsIn this work, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and the potential of associated mutations to trigger or hinder CD8+ T-cells response. We also estimated the populations coverage of these different lineages, considering peptide binding predictions to class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages.

ResultsWe observed a lower populational coverage for 20B/S.484K (P.2 lineage) in contrast to an increased coverage found for 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 Lineage) and 20J/501Y.V3 (P.1 lineage) compared to a reference lineage. Moreover, mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid T205I were predicted to have an overall higher affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence.

ConclusionsIn summary, the data in this work provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also highlights the reduced populationals coverage for the Brazilian lineage P.2, suggesting its potential to evade from CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results also may guide efforts to characterize and validate relevant peptides to trigger CD8+ T-cell responses, and design new universal T-cell-inducing vaccine candidates that minimize detrimental effects of viral diversification and at the same time induce responses to a broad human population.",Marco Antonio Marques Pretti; Romulo Goncalves Galvani; Alessandro S Farias; Mariana Boroni,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434584,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434584,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,False
341,All Models Are Useful: Bayesian Ensembling for Robust High Resolution COVID-19 Forecasting,"Timely, high-resolution forecasts of infectious disease incidence are useful for policy makers in deciding intervention measures and estimating healthcare resource burden. In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our models performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections. Our work demonstrates that such a real-time high resolution forecasting pipeline can be developed by integrating multiple methods within a performance-based ensemble to support pandemic response.

342,Modeling the use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to safely relax non-pharmaceutical interventions,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, mask wearing, and enhanced hygiene, have been implemented. As of March 2021, three effective vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the United States, with several other vaccines in the pipeline. We use a transmission model to study when and how NPIs could be relaxed in the United States with relative safety as vaccination becomes more widespread. We compare different relaxation scenarios where NPIs begin to relax 0-9 months after vaccination begins for both a one dose and two dose strategy, with historical levels of social interactions being reached within 1 month to 1 year. In our model, vaccination can allow widespread relaxation of NPIs to begin safely within 2 to 9 months, greatly reducing deaths and peak health system burden compared to relaxing NPIs without vaccination. Vaccinated individuals can safely begin to relax NPIs sooner than unvaccinated individuals. The extent of delay needed to safely reopen depends primarily on the rate of vaccine rollout, with the degree of protection against asymptomatic infection playing a secondary role. If a vaccination rate of 3 million doses/day can be achieved, similar to the typical rollout speed of seasonal influenza vaccination, NPIs could begin to be safely relaxed in 2-3 months. With a vaccination rate of 1 million doses/day, a 6-9-month delay is needed. A one dose strategy is preferred if relative efficacy is similar to a two-dose series, but the relative benefit of this strategy is minimal when vaccine rollout is fast. Due to the urgent need to pursue strategies that enable safe relaxation of NPIs, we recommend a two-dose strategy with an initial delay of at least 3 months in relaxing restrictions further, and that the speed of vaccine rollout be given immediate priority.",Alicia N M Kraay; Molly E.

343,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundAlthough the number of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases continues to increase globally, there are few studies on the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo conduct a comprehensive systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents to better guide the response to the current epidemic.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI (Chinese database), Clinical Trials.gov and chictr.org.cn (China). The methodological quality of the included literature was evaluated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14.0. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified using I2. We used fixed-effects or random-effects models to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated by the Beggs test.

ResultsWe analyzed 49 studies involving 1627 patients. In the pooled data, the most common clinical symptoms were fever (56% [0.50-0.61]) and cough (45% [0.39-0.51]). The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated procalcitonin (40% [0.23-0.57]), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (31% [0.19-0.43]), increased lymphocyte count (28% [0.17-0.42]), increased creatine kinase (28% [0.18- 0.40]), and elevated C-reactive protein (26% [0.17-0.36]). The most common abnormalities determined by computed tomography were lower-lobe involvement (56% [0.42-0.70]), ground-glass opacities (33% [0.25-0.42]), bilateral pneumonia (32% [0.24-0.40]), patchy shadowing (31% [0.18-0.45]), and upper lobe involvement (30% [0.20-0.41]).

344,Rapid review of social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundPhysical distancing measures aim to reduce person-to-person contact, a key driver of transmission of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review aims to synthesize empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodWe conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures.

ResultsWe identified 12 studies that reported social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of studies (11/12) collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns and the most stringent physical distancing measures. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2-5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates which ranged from 7-26 contacts per day in similar settings. This reduction was particularly pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates subsequently increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults.

ConclusionInformation on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",Carol Y.

345,The efficacy and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe global total of COVID-19 cases will reach 20 million this week, with 750,000 deaths. It has spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world. At present, the global pandemic continues to rise and continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to explore the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19 as soon as possible. Remdesiviras was an antiviral agent with therapeutic potential, but it was still controversial.

ObjectiveThrough systematic review and meta-analysis, to evaluate the effect and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and will provide a reliable reference for the treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsWe used the following search string: ""COVID-19"" [Mesh], ""remdesivir"" [Mesh], ""randomized controlled trial"" [Mesh]. We used the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and corresponding keywords to make the search strategy. We searched six databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trials.gov and chictr.org.cn. Data analyses were conducted by using the software Review Manager 5.3 and STATA version 14.0.

ResultsOur systematic search identified 5 meta-analyses of RCTs, including 1782 patients with COVID-19.The clinical improvement of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 was superior to the placebo-controlled group (relative risk (RR) =1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.29, p=0.0009). The following are the Single-Arm Study, Meta-analysis results. The pooled prevalence of clinical improvement significant findings was 62% (95% CI = 59-65%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir. The incidence rates of Acute kidney injury, Hepatic enzyme increased, Any serious adverse event were 5% (95%CI=3-7%, p=0.00), 11%(95%CI=5-16%, p=0.00), 22%(95%CI=18-27%, p=0.00), respectively, and the mortality was 13%(95%CI=8-19%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir.

ConclusionThis analysis confirms that remdesivir is effective in the clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients, and the rate of clinical improvement was 62%.

346,Engagement with daily testing instead of self-isolating in contacts of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2.,"BackgroundIn December 2020, Public Health England with NHS Test and Trace initiated a pilot study in which close contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19 were given the option to carryout lateral flow device antigen tests at home, as an alternative to self-isolation for 10-14 days. In this study, we evaluated acceptability of and engagement with daily testing, and assessed levels of adherence to the rules relating to behaviour following positive or negative test results.

MethodsWe conducted a service evaluation of a pilot study, involving an online cross-sectional survey offered to adult (> 18 years) contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases who were invited to participate in seven days of daily testing instead of isolation. We used a comparison group of contacts who were not offered testing and performed self-isolation. Herein, we examine survey responses from a subset of those who took part in the pilot study and who responded to the evaluation questionnaire.

ResultsAcceptability of daily testing was lower among survey respondents who were not offered the option of having it and among people from ethnic minority groups. Overall, 52% of respondents reported being more likely to share details of people that they had been in contact with following a positive test result, if they knew that their contacts would be offered the option of daily testing. Only 2% reported that they would be less likely to provide details of their contacts. On the days that they were trying to self-isolate, 19% of participants reported that they left the house, with no significant demographic group differences. Following a negative test, 13% of respondents reported that they increased their contacts, but most (58%) reported having fewer risky contacts.

ConclusionsOur data suggest that daily testing is potentially acceptable, and may facilitate sharing contact details of close contacts among those who test positive for COVID-19, and promote adherence to self-isolation. A better understanding is needed of how to make this option more acceptable for all households. The impact of receiving a negative test on behaviour remains a risk that needs to be monitored and mitigated by appropriate messaging. Future research should examine attitudes and behaviour in a context where infection levels are lower, testing is more familiar, much of the population has been vaccinated and restrictions on activity have been reduced.",Alex F Martin; Sarah Denford; Nicola Love; Derren Ready; Isabel Oliver; Richard Amlot; G.

347,"The causal effect of serum vitamin D concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits: a Mendelian randomization study","BackgroundEvidence supporting the role of vitamin D in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains controversial.

MethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to analyze the causal effect of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits by using summary-level GWAS data. The causal associations were estimated with inverse variance weighted (IVW) with fixed effects (IVW-fixed) and random effects (IVW-random), MR-Egger, weighted median and MR Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR.RAPS) methods. We further applied the MR Steiger filtering method, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test and PhenoScanner tool to check and remove single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were horizontally pleiotropic.

ResultsWe found no evidence to support the causal associations between the serum 25(OH)D concentration and the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility (IVW-fixed: odds ratio [OR] = 0.9049, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8197[~]0.9988, p = 0.0473), severity (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0298, 95% CI 0.7699[~]1.3775, p = 0.8432) and hospitalized traits (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0713, 95% CI 0.8819[~]1.3013, p = 0.4878) using outlier removed sets at a Bonferroni-corrected p threshold of 0.0167. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal any sign of horizontal pleiotropy.

ConclusionsOur MR analysis provided precise evidence that genetically lowered serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not causally associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity or hospitalized traits. Our study therefore did not provide evidence assessing the role of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to explore and define the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",Zhiyong Cui; Yun Tian,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252901,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252901,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
348,A potential SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest (VOI) harboring mutation E484K in the Spike protein was identified within lineage B.1.1.33 circulating in Brazil,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil was dominated by two lineages designated as B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33. Two SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the Spike (S) protein, designated as lineages P.1 and P.2, evolved within lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a Variant of Concern (VOC) because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein (including K417T, E484K, N501Y), while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a Variant of Interest (VOI). Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021.

349,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and viral RNA on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and investigating contamination concentration,"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces. Many studies have used RT-PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered, and whether virus viability is concentration dependant.

Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 124 and 113 hours respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 hours. Viability on cotton was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 72 hours. RNA on all the surfaces exhibited a one log reduction in genome copy recovery over 21 days.

The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on non-porous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces with only one log reduction in recovery over three weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within two days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces it does not directly indicate presence of viable virus even at high CT values.

ImportanceThis study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface. Unless sampled immediately after contamination it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.",Susan Elizabeth Paton; Antony Spencer; Isobel Garratt; Katy-Anne Thompson; Ikshitaa Dinesh; Paz AranegaBou; David Stevenson; Simon O Clark; Jake Dunning; Allan M Bennett; Thomas Pottage,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.435056,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.435056,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,False
350,Multi-resolution characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic: A unified framework and open-source tool,"Amidst the continuing spread of COVID-19, real-time data analysis and visualization remain critical to track the pandemics impact and inform policy making. Multiple metrics have been considered to evaluate the spread, infection, and mortality of infectious diseases. For example, numbers of new cases and deaths provide measures of absolute impact within a given population and time frame, while the effective reproduction rate provides a measure of the rate of spread. It is critical to evaluate multiple metrics concurrently, as they provide complementary insights into the impact and current state of the pandemic. We describe a unified framework for estimating and quantifying the uncertainty in the smoothed daily effective reproduction number, case rate, and death rate in a region using log-linear models. We apply this framework to characterize COVID-19 impact at multiple geographic resolutions, including by US county and state as well as by country, demonstrating the variation across resolutions and the need for harmonized efforts to control the pandemic. We provide an open-source online dashboard for real-time analysis and visualization of multiple key metrics, which are critical to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and make informed policy decisions.",Andy Shi; Sheila M.

351,COVID-19 Risk Factors and Mortality among Native Americans,"BACKGROUNDAcademic research on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 among Native Americans has largely been restricted to particular indigenous groups or reservations.

OBJECTIVEWe estimate COVID-19 mortality for Native Americans relative to other racial/ethnic groups and explore how state-level mortality is associated with known risk factors. METHODS: We use the Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR), adjusted for age and county, to estimate COVID-19 mortality by racial/ethnic groups for the U.S. and 10 selected states. The prevalence of risk factors is derived from the American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

RESULTSThe SMR for Native Americans greatly exceeds those for Black and Latino populations and varies enormously across states. There is a strong correlation between the share of Native Americans living on a reservation and the SMR. The SMR for Native Americans is also highly correlated with the income-poverty ratio and the prevalence of multigenerational families, crowded housing, frontline worker status, and health insurance (excluding the Indian Health Service). Risk factors associated with socioeconomic status and co-morbidities are generally more prevalent for Native Americans living on homelands, a proxy for reservation status, than for those living elsewhere.

CONCLUSIONSMost risk factors for COVID-19 are disproportionately high among Native Americans, particularly for those living on homelands. Reservation life appears to increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality.

352,Limits of lockdown: characterising essential contacts during strict physical distancing,"COVID-19 has exposed health inequalities within countries and globally. The fundamental determining factor behind an individuals risk of infection is the number of social contacts they make. In many countries, physical distancing measures have been implemented to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2, reducing social contacts to a minimum. Characterising unavoidable social contacts is key for understanding the inequalities behind differential risks and planning vaccination programmes. We utilised an existing English longitudinal birth cohort, which is broadly representative of the wider population (n=6807), to explore social contact patterns and behaviours when strict physical distancing measures were in place during the UKs first lockdown in March-May 2020. Essential workers, specifically those in healthcare, had 4.5 times as many contacts as non-essential workers [incident rate ratio = 4.42 (CI95%: 3.88-5.04)], whilst essential workers in other sectors, mainly teaching and the police force had three times as many contacts [IRR = 2.84 (2.58-3.13)]. The number of individuals in a household, which is conflated by number of children, increases essential social contacts by 40%. Self-isolation effectively reduces numbers of contacts outside of the home, but not entirely. Together, these findings will aid the interpretation of epidemiological data and impact the design of effective SARS-CoV-2 control strategies, such as vaccination, testing and contact tracing.",Amy C Thomas; Leon Danon; Hannah Christensen; Kate Northstone; Daniel Smith; Emily J Nixon; Adam Trickey; Gibran Hemani; Sarah Sauchelli; Adam Finn; Nicholas J Timpson; Ellen Brooks-Pollock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253484,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253484,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
353,Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers in Kenya,"BackgroundFew studies have assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in Africa. We report findings from a survey among HCWs in three counties in Kenya.

MethodsWe recruited 684 HCWs from Kilifi (rural), Busia (rural) and Nairobi (urban) counties. The serosurvey was conducted between 30th July 2020 and 4th December 2020. We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. We adjusted prevalence estimates using Bayesian modeling to account for assay performance.

ResultsCrude overall seroprevalence was 19.7% (135/684). After adjustment for assay performance seroprevalence was 20.8% (95% CI 17.5-24.4%). Seroprevalence varied significantly (p<0.001) by site: 43.8% (CI 35.8-52.2%) in Nairobi, 12.6% (CI 8.8-17.1%) in Busia and 11.5% (CI 7.2-17.6%) in Kilifi. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex and site, professional cadre was not associated with differences in seroprevalence.

We tested the hypothesis that the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests varied by time of day, suggesting variation in viral shedding by time of day. Among 30,000 clinical tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the Vanderbilt Affiliated Healthcare Network from March-June 2020, we found evidence for diurnal variation in the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, with a peak around 2pm in the afternoon and 2-fold variation over the day.

355,Is there a serum proteome signature to predict mortality in severe COVID-19 patients?,"Here we recorded serum proteome profiles of 33 COVID-19 patients admitted to respiratory and intensive care units because of respiratory failure. We received, for most patients, blood samples just after admission and at two more later timepoints. We focused on serum proteins different in abundance between the group of survivors and non-survivors and observed that a rather small panel of about a dozen proteins were significantly different in abundance between these two groups. The four structurally and functionally related type-3 cystatins AHSG, FETUB, HRG and KNG1 were all more abundant in the survivors. The family of inter--trypsin inhibitors, ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3 and ITIH4, were all found to be differentially abundant in between survivors and non-survivors, whereby ITIH1 and ITIH2 were more abundant in the survivor group and ITIH3 and ITIH4 more abundant in the non-survivors. ITIH1/ITIH2 and ITIH3/ITIH4 also did show opposite trends in protein abundance during disease progression. This panel of eight proteins, complemented with a few more, may represent a panel for mortality risk assessment and eventually even for treatment, by administration of exogenous proteins possibly aiding survival. Such administration is not unprecedented, as administration of exogenous inter--trypsin inhibitors is already used in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis and Kawasaki disease. The mortality risk panel defined here is in excellent agreement with findings in two recent COVID-19 serum proteomics studies on independent cohorts, supporting our findings. This panel may not be unique for COVID-19, as some of the proteins here annotated as mortality risk factors have previously been annotated as mortality markers in aging and in other diseases caused by different pathogens, including bacteria.",Franziska Voellmy; Henk van den Toorn; Riccardo Zenezini Chiozzi; Ottavio Zucchetti; Albetto Papi; Carlo Alberto Volta; Luisa Marracino; Francesco Vieceli Dalla Sega; Francecsca Fortini; Gianluca Campo; Marco Contoli; Savino Spadaro; Paola Rizzo; Albert J.R.

356,Awake prone position in adult nonintubated patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19:A multi-centre feasibility randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundThe primary manifestation of Corona Virus Disease -2019 (COVID-19) is acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prone position has been shown to improve outcomes in ventilated patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The feasibility and safety of awake prone positioning and its impact on outcomes if any, in non-intubated patients with mild to moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 is unknown. Results of the observational studies published thus far in this pandemic have been conflicting. In this context, we conducted a multi-centre, parallel group, randomised controlled feasibility study on awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.

Methods60 patients diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID -19 pneumonia requiring 4 or more litres of oxygen to maintain a saturation of [&ge;] 92% were recruited in this study. Thirty patients each were randomised to either standard care or awake prone group. Patients randomised to the standard care were allowed to change their position as per comfort and patients randomized to the prone group were encouraged to self-prone for at least 6 hours a day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adhering to the protocol in each group. Secondary outcomes include failure of therapy leading to escalation of respiratory support, number of hours prone, maximum hours of continuous prone positioning in a day, length of stay in ICU, ICU mortality, total number of patients needing intubation and adverse events.

ResultsIn the prone group, 43% (13 out of 30) of patients were able to self-prone for 6 or more hours a day. The median maximum prone duration per session was 2 hours. In the supine group, 47% (14 out of 30) were completely supine and 53% spent some hours in the prone position, but none exceeded 6 hours. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes between the two groups and there were no adverse events.

InterpretationAwake proning in non-intubated patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure is feasible and safe under clinical trial conditions. The results of our feasibility study will potentially help in the design of larger definitive trials to address this key knowledge gap.",Devachandran Jayakumar; Pratheema Ramachandran; Ebenezer Rabindrarajan; Bharathkumar Tirupakuzhi Vijayaraghavan; Ramakrishnan Nagarajan; Ramesh Venkataraman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253499,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253499,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
357,Serum Vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 severity markers and mortality independent of visceral adiposity,"INTRODUCTIONCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and 25-OHD levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined.

METHODSConsecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation (including outcomes), laboratory measurements (including 25-OHD) and a thoracic computerized tomography (including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness). Low vitamin D was defined as levels <20ng/mL (<50nmol/L) and severely low (or deficient) 25-OHD as a level [&le;]12ng/mL (<30nmol/L)

RESULTSOf the 551 patients included, low 25-OHD levels were present in 45.6% and severely low levels in 10.9%. Severely low 25-OHD levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95%CI 1.24-3.58, p=0.006) but not with critical COVID-19 (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.94-0.99, p=0.042), adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat. Using model-based causal mediation analyses the increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by 25-OHD levels was partly mediated by its effect on D-dimer and cardiac ultrasensitive troponins. Notably, increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was independent of BMI and epicardial fat.

CONCLUSIONVitamin D deficiency ([&le;]12ng/mL or <30nmol/L), is independently associated with COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for visceral fat (epicardial fat thickness). Low 25-OHD may contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, increasing the risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.",Pablo Esteban Vanegas-Cedillo; Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla; Natalia Ramírez-Pedraza; Bethsabel Rodríguez-Encinas; Carolina Isabel Pérez-Carrión; María Isabel Jasso-Ávila; Jorge Valladares-Garcia; Diana Hernández-Juárez; Arsenio Vargas-Vázquez; Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa; Monica Chapa-Ibarguengoitia; Alfredo Ponce de Leon; Jose Sifuentes-Osornio; Carlos A Aguilar-Salinas; Roopa Mehta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253490,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253490,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
358,Interventions to control nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study,"BackgroundEmergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants requires more efficient control measures to limit nosocomial transmission and maintain healthcare capacities during pandemic waves. Yet, the relative importance of different strategies is unknown.

MethodsWe developed an agent-based model and compared the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE), screening of healthcare workers (HCWs), contact tracing of symptomatic HCWs, and restricting HCWs from working in multiple units (HCW cohorting) on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model was fit on hospital data from the first wave in the Netherlands (February until August 2020) and assumed that HCWs used 90% effective PPE in COVID-19 wards and self-isolated at home for seven days immediately upon symptom onset. Intervention effects on the effective reproduction number (RE), HCW absenteeism and the proportion of infected individuals among tested individuals (positivity rate) were estimated for a more transmissible variant.

ResultsIntroduction of a variant with 56% higher transmissibility increased - all other variables kept constant - RE from 0.4 to 0.65 (+63%) and nosocomial transmissions by 303%, mainly because of more transmissions caused by pre-symptomatic patients and HCWs. Compared to baseline, PPE use in all hospital wards (assuming 90% effectiveness) reduced RE by 85% and absenteeism by 57%. Screening HCWs every three days with perfect test sensitivity reduced RE by 67%, yielding a maximum test positivity rate of 5%. Screening HCWs every three or seven days assuming time-varying test sensitivities reduced RE by 9% and 3%, respectively. Contact tracing reduced RE by at least 32% and achieved higher test positivity rates than screening interventions. HCW cohorting reduced RE by 5%. Sensitivity analyses for 50% and 70% effectiveness of PPE use did not change interpretation.

ConclusionsIn response to the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, PPE use in all hospital wards might still be most effective in preventing nosocomial transmission. Regular screening and contact tracing of HCWs are also effective interventions, but critically depend on the sensitivity of the diagnostic test used.",Thi Mui Pham; Hannan Tahir; Janneke HHM van de Wijgert; Bastiaan Van der Roest; Pauline Ellerbroek; Marc JM Bonten; Martin CJ Bootsma; Mirjam E Kretzschmar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252327,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252327,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
359,Age-dependent impact of the major common genetic risk factor for COVID-19 on severity and mortality,"BackgroundThere is considerable variability in COVID-19 outcomes amongst younger adults--and some of this variation may be due to genetic predisposition. We characterized the clinical implications of the major genetic risk factor for COVID-19 severity, and its age-dependent effect, using individual-level data in a large international multi-centre consortium.

MethodThe major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is a chromosome 3 locus, tagged by the marker rs10490770. We combined individual level data for 13,424 COVID-19 positive patients (N=6,689 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in nine countries to assess the association of this genetic marker with mortality, COVID-19-related complications and laboratory values. We next examined if the magnitude of these associations varied by age and were independent from known clinical COVID-19 risk factors.

FindingsWe found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1{middle dot}4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1{middle dot}2-1{middle dot}6) and COVID-19 related mortality (HR 1{middle dot}5, 95%CI 1{middle dot}3-1{middle dot}8). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] 2{middle dot}0, 95%CI 1{middle dot}6-2{middle dot}6), venous thromboembolism (OR 1{middle dot}7, 95%CI 1{middle dot}2-2{middle dot}4), and hepatic injury (OR 1{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}2-2{middle dot}0). Risk allele carriers [&le;] 60 years had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR 2{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}8-3{middle dot}9) compared to those > 60 years OR 1{middle dot}5 (95%CI 1{middle dot}3-1{middle dot}9, interaction p-value=0{middle dot}04). Amongst individuals [&le;] 60 years who died or experienced severe respiratory COVID-19 outcome, we found that 31{middle dot}8% (95%CI 27{middle dot}6-36{middle dot}2) were risk variant carriers, compared to 13{middle dot}9% (95%CI 12{middle dot}6-15{middle dot}2%) of those not experiencing these outcomes. Prediction of death or severe respiratory failure among those [&le;] 60 years improved when including the risk allele (AUC 0{middle dot}82 vs 0{middle dot}84, p=0{middle dot}016) and the prediction ability of rs10490770 risk allele was similar to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors.

InterpretationThe major common COVID-19 risk locus on chromosome 3 is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality--and these are more pronounced amongst individuals [&le;] 60 years. The effect on COVID-19 severity was similar to, or larger than most established risk factors, suggesting potential implications for clinical risk management.

360,"Mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil, February 2020 to February 2021: insights and limitations from uneven sequencing efforts","The COVID-19 pandemic has already reached approximately 110 million people and it is associated with 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Brazil is the third worst-hit country, with approximately 10.2 million cases and 250 thousand deaths. Unprecedented international efforts have been established in order to share information about epidemiology, viral evolution and transmission dynamics. However, sequencing facilities and research investments are very heterogeneous across different regions and countries across the globe. The understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology is a vital part for the development of effective strategies for public health care and disease management. This work aims to analyze the available genomes sequenced in Brazil between February 2020 and February 2021, in order to identify mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the Brazilian territory by using phylogenetics and phylodynamics analyses from high-quality genomes. We describe heterogeneous and episodic sequencing efforts, the progression of the different lineages along time, evaluating mutational spectra and frequency oscillations derived from the prevalence of novel and specific lineages across different Brazilian regions. We found at least seven major (1-7) and two minor clades (4.2 and 5.3) related to the six most prevalent Brazilian lineages and described its distribution across the Brazilian territory. The emergence and recent frequency shift of lineages (P.1 and P.2) containing mutations of concern in the spike protein (e. g., E484K, N501Y) draws attention due to their association with immune evasion and enhanced receptor binding affinity. Improvements in genomic surveillance are of paramount importance and should be extended in Brazil to better inform policy makers and enable precise evidence-based decisions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.",Vinicius Bonetti Franceschi; Patricia Aline Grohs Ferrareze; Ricardo Ariel Zimerman; Gabriela Bettella Cybis; Claudia Elizabeth Thompson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253152,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253152,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
361,Forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic integrating symptom search behavior: an infodemiology study,"BackgroundPrevious studies have suggested associations between trends of web searches and COVID-19 traditional metrics. It remains unclear whether models incorporating trends of digital searches lead to better predictions.

MethodsAn open-access web application was developed to evaluate Google Trends and traditional COVID-19 metrics via an interactive framework based on principal components analysis (PCA) and time series modelling. The app facilitates the analysis of symptom search behavior associated with COVID-19 disease in 188 countries. In this study, we selected data of eight countries as case studies to represent all continents. PCA was used to perform data dimensionality reduction, and three different time series models (Error Trend Seasonality, Autoregressive integrated moving average, and feed-forward neural network autoregression) were used to predict COVID-19 metrics in the upcoming 14 days. The models were compared in terms of prediction ability using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the first principal component (PC1). Predictive ability of models generated with both Google Trends data and conventional COVID-19 metrics were compared with those fitted with conventional COVID-19 metrics only.

FindingsThe degree of correlation and the best time-lag varied as a function of the selected country and topic searched; in general, the optimal time-lag was within 15 days. Overall, predictions of PC1 based on both searched termed and COVID-19 traditional metrics performed better than those not including Google searches (median [IQR]: 1.43 [0.74-2.36] vs. 1.78 [0.95-2.88], respectively), but the improvement in prediction varied as a function of the selected country and timeframe. The best model varied as a function of country, time range, and period of time selected.

362,Outcome of Different Therapeutic Interventions in Mild COVID-19 Patients in a Single OPD Clinic of West Bengal: A Retrospective study,"IntroductionWith over 87,273,380 cases being reported and 1,899,440 deaths worldwide as of 9th January 2021, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the worst-hit pandemic till date. Every day clinicians are bombarded with many new treatment options that claim to be better than the others.

Materials and methodsAfter screening the electronic database of COVID-19 patients retrospectively, 56 patients with mild COVID-19 infection matched the inclusion criteria and were divided into the four following groups - group having used Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), group using doxycycline (DOX) + Ivermectin (IVR) combination, group receiving only azithromycin (AZ) and, group receiving only symptomatic treatment. The studys primary objective was to see Clinical response of well-being (CRWB) reporting time after initiating treatment onset between the four different treatment arms.

ResultsCRWB did not differ between the four groups receiving four different managements (p-value 0.846). There was significant correlation between blood levels of LDH (p-value 0.001), CRP (p-value 0.03) and D-dimer (p-value 0.04) with CRWB in IVR+DOX group and, between LDH (p-value 0.001), CRP (p-value 0.01) and age (p-value 0.035) with CRWB in the symptomatic management group.

363,SARS-CoV-2 seroassay optimization and performance in a population with high background reactivity in Mali,"Serological tests are an indispensable tool to understand the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in areas where molecular diagnostics are limited. Poor assay performance may hinder the utility of these tests, including high rates of false-positivity previously reported in sub-Saharan Africa. From 312 Malian samples collected prior to 2020, we measured antibodies to the commonly tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens and four other betacoronaviruses by ELISA, and assessed functional cross-reactivity in a subset by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. We then evaluated the performance of an ELISA developed in the US, using two-antigen SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain. To optimize test performance, we compared single and two-antigen approaches using existing assay cutoffs and population-specific cutoffs for Malian control samples (positive and negative). Background reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was common in pre-pandemic samples compared to US controls (43.4% (135/311) for spike protein, 22.8% (71/312) for RBD, and 33.9% (79/233) for nucleocapsid protein). SARS-CoV-2 reactivity correlated weakly with other betacoronavirus reactivity, varied between Malian communities, and increased with age. No pre-pandemic samples demonstrated functional activity. Regardless of the cutoffs applied, specificity improved using a two-antigen approach. Test performance was optimal using a two-antigen assay with population-specific cutoffs derived from ROC curve analysis [Sensitivity: 73.9% (51.6-89.8), Specificity: 99.4% (97.7-99.9)]. In the setting of high background reactivity, such as sub-Saharan Africa, SARS-CoV-2 serological assays need careful qualification is to characterize the epidemiology of disease, prevent unnecessary harm, and allocate resources for targeted control measures.",John Woodford; Issaka Sagara; Jennifer Kwan; Amatigue Zeguime; Irfan Zaidi; Oumar Attaher; Mamady Kone; Justin Y.A.

366,Evolutionary and phenotypic characterization of spike mutations in a new SARS-CoV-2 Lineage reveals two Variants of Interest,"Molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 aims to monitor the appearance of new variants with the potential to change the virulence or transmissibility of the virus. During the first year of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, numerous variants with possible public health impact have emerged. We have detected two mutations in the Spike protein at amino acid positions 1163 and 1167 that have appeared independently multiple times in different genetic backgrounds, indicating they may increase viral fitness. Interestingly, the majority of these sequences appear in transmission clusters, with the genotype encoding mutations at both positions increasing in frequency more than single-site mutants. This genetic outcome that we denote as Lineage B.1.177.637, belongs to clade 20E and includes 12 additional single nucleotide polymorphisms but no deletions with respect to the reference genome (first sequence in Wuhan). B.1.177.637 appeared after the first wave of the epidemic in Spain, and subsequently spread to eight additional countries, increasing in frequency among sequences in public databases. Positions 1163 and 1167 of the Spike protein are situated in the HR2 domain, which is implicated in the fusion of the host and viral membranes. To better understand the effect of these mutations on the virus, we examined whether B.1.177.637 altered infectivity, thermal stability, or antibody sensitivity. Unexpectedly, we observed reduced infectivity of this variant relative to the ancestral 20E variant in vitro while the levels of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs did not vary significantly. In addition, we found the mutations do not impact thermal stability or antibody susceptibility in vaccinated individuals but display a moderate reduction in sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent sera from early stages of the pandemic. Altogether, this lineage could be considered a Variant of Interest (VOI), we denote VOI1163.7. Finally, we detected a sub-cluster of sequences within VOI1163.7 that have acquired two additional changes previously associated with antibody escape and it could be identified as VOI1163.7.V2. Overall, we have detected the spread of a new Spike variant that may be advantageous to the virus and whose continuous transmission poses risks by the acquisition of additional mutations that could affect pre-existing immunity.",Paula Ruiz-Rodriguez; Clara Frances-Gomez; Álvaro Chiner-Oms; Mariana G.

367,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence and determinants of six ethnic groups living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands: a population-based cross-sectional study, June-October 2020","BackgroundEthnic minorities have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, but little is known about ethnic differences in past exposure. We aimed to determine whether prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied between six ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

MethodsParticipants aged 25-79 years enrolled in a population-based prospective cohort were randomly selected within ethnic groups and invited to test for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and answer COVID-19 related questions. We estimated prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure within ethnic groups using survey-weighted logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and calendar time.

ResultsBetween June 24-October 9, 2020, we included 2497 participants. Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was comparable between ethnic-Dutch (25/498; 5.5%, 95%CI=3.2-7.9), South-Asian Surinamese (22/451; 4.8%, 95%CI=2.1-7.5), African Surinamese (22/400; 8.2%, 95%CI=3.0-13.4), Turkish (30/408; 7.8%, 95%CI=4.3-11.2) and Moroccan (32/391; 7.0%, 95%CI=4.0-9.9) participants, but higher among Ghanaians (95/327; 26.5%, 95%CI=18.7-34.4). 57.1% of SARS-CoV-2-positive participants did not suspect or were unsure of being infected, which was lowest in African Surinamese (18.2%) and highest in Ghanaians (90.5%). Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied across ethnic groups, while the most common determinant was having a household member suspected of infection. In Ghanaians, seropositivity was associated with older age, larger household sizes, living with small children, leaving home to work and attending religious services.

ConclusionsNo remarkable differences in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were observed between the largest ethnic groups in Amsterdam after the first wave of infections. The higher infection seroprevalence observed among Ghanaians, which passed mostly unnoticed, warrants wider prevention efforts and opportunities for non-symptom-based testing.",Liza Coyer; Anders Boyd; Janke Schinkel; Charles Agyemang; Henrike Galenkamp; Anitra D.

The Universal rule requires that Herd immunity begin when just 25% of the population is vaccinated. With the anticipated 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of the Biden administration, Herd immunity may be imminent in the US.

The Universal rule promotes a temporary stasis with continuing infections and hospitalizations and becomes a barrier to runaway infections, making it practically impossible to reach Herd immunity, as Sweden discovered.

370,Process evaluation of the development and remote recruitment for Essential Coaching for Every Mother during COVID-19,"BackgroundWith the sudden decrease in in-person support and increase in perinatal mental health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, innovative strategies, such as mHealth, are more important than ever. This study has two objectives: (1) to describe the modification of Essential Coaching for Every Mother during the coronavirus pandemic, and (2) to describe the process evaluation of recruitment and retention of pregnant and postpartum women for a pre-post intervention study.

MethodsFor objective 1, modified messages were piloted with mothers and postpartum healthcare providers simultaneously. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of 10 participants from the original development study. For objective 2, three methods were used for recruitment: social media, posters in hospital, and media outreach. First time mothers were eligible for enrollment antenatally (37+ weeks) and postnatally (<3 weeks). Eligibility screening occurred remotely via text message with participants initiating contact. Data were collected via TextIt and REDCap. Outcomes were days to recruit 75 participants, eligibility vs. ineligibility rates, dropout and exclusion reasons, survey completion rates, perinatal timing of enrollment, and recruitment sources.

ResultsFor objective 1, three mothers (M age=30.67 years) and seven healthcare providers (M age = 46.0 years) participated in the modification of the messages. Participants felt the messages were appropriate and relevant related to changes in postpartum care during the coronavirus pandemic. Nine messages were modified related to coronavirus and five messages were added to the program. For objective 2, recruitment ran July 15th-September 19th (67 days) with 200 screened and 88 enrolled, 70% antenatally. It took 50 days to enroll 75 participants. Mothers recruited antenatally (n=53) were more likely to receive all intervention message (68% vs. 19%). Mothers recruited postnatally (n=35) missed more messages on average (13.8 vs. 6.4). Participants heard about the study through family/friends (31%), news (20%), Facebook groups (16%), Facebook ads (14%), posters (12%), or other ways (7%).

ConclusionAntenatal recruitment resulted in participants enrolling earlier and receiving more of the study messages.

371,"Evaluating the impacts of tiered restrictions introduced in England, during October and December 2020 on COVID-19 cases: A synthetic control study.","BackgroundIn 2020, a second wave of COVID-19 cases unevenly affected places in England leading to the introduction of a tiered system of controls with different geographical areas subject to different levels of restrictions. Whilst previous research has examined the impact of national lockdowns on transmission, there has been limited research examining the marginal effect of differences in localised restrictions or how these effects vary between socioeconomic contexts. We therefore examined how Tier 3 restrictions in England implemented between October-December 2020, which included additional restrictions on the hospitality sector and people meeting outdoors affected COVID-19 case rates, compared to Tier 2 restrictions, and how these effects varied by level of deprivation.

MethodsWe used data on weekly reported COVID-19 cases for 7201 neighbourhoods in England and adjusted these for changing case-detection rates to provide an estimate of weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in each neighbourhood. We identified those areas that entered Tier 3 restrictions at two time points in October and December, and constructed a synthetic control group of similar places that had entered Tier 2 restrictions, using calibration weights to match them on a wide range of covariates that may influence transmission. We then compared the change in weekly infections between those entering Tier 3 to the synthetic control group to estimate the proportional reduction of cases resulting from Tier 3 restrictions compared to Tier 2 restrictions, over a 4-week period. We further used interaction analysis to estimate whether this effect differed based on the level of socioeconomic deprivation in each neighbourhood and whether effects were modified by the prevalence of a new more infectious variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) in each area.

ResultsThe introduction of Tier 3 restrictions in October and December was associated with a 14% (95% CI 10% to 19%) and 20% (95% CI 13% to 29%) reduction in infections respectively, compared to the rates expected if only Tier 2 restrictions had been in place in those areas. We found that effects were similar across levels of deprivation and limited evidence that Tier 3 restrictions had a greater effect in areas where the new more infectious variant was more prevalent.

InterpretationAdditional restrictions on hospitality and meeting outdoors introduced in Tier 3 areas in England had a moderate effect on transmission and these restrictions did not appear to increase inequalities, having a similar impact across areas with differing levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Where transmission risks vary between geographical areas a tiered approach of local restrictions on outdoor mixing and hospitality can contribute to control of SARS-CoV-2 and is unlikely to increases inequalities in transmission.",Xingna Zhang; Gwilym Owen; Mark Green; Iain Buchan; Ben Barr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253165,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
372,Changes in eating habits and lifestyles in Peruvian population during social isolation by the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic caused that some governments have implemented house confinement measures with probable consequences on lifestyle, particularly affecting eating habits, physical activity, sleep quality, and mental health.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the frequency of lifestyles, physical activity and sleep characteristics, as well as changes in eating habits in the Peruvian population during COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA Cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. We analyzed adults from Peru between July to August 2020 based on an online self-administered questionnaire divided into sociodemographic, anthropometrics and COVID-19 diagnostic reported, lifestyle habits and frequency of consumption of foods.

FindingsDuring confinement by COVID-19, 1176 participants were studied, 39% were student, 37.5% were workers and 46% were assert not to work. The population asserted gain weight (1 to 3 Kg) and 35.7% were overweight. The lifestyles habits showed that 54.8% affirmed to doing physical activity and a large proportion (37.2%) asserted sleep less. The Peruvian population presented a main feeding patter of breakfast (95.7%), lunch (97.5%), dinner (89.1%) and brunch (44.9%). Likewise, feeding habits before and during COVID-19 pandemic showed that vegetables (OR:1.56, CI95% 1.21 - 200), fruit (OR: 1.42, CI95% 1.10 - 1.81), legumes (OR:1.67, CI95% 1.23 - 2.28) and eggs (OR: 2.00, CI95% 1.52 - 2.65) presented significantly consumption increase during social isolation, while bakery products (OR: 0.74, CI95% 0.56 - 0.97), meat, snack, refreshment and fast-food decrease consumption.

MethodsWe conducted a representative household-based cross-sectional serosurvey in Juba, South Sudan. We quantified IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain and estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model accounting for test performance.

ResultsWe recruited 2,214 participants from August 10 to September 11, 2020 and 22.3% had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers above levels in pre-pandemic samples. After accounting for waning antibody levels, age, and sex, we estimated that 38.5% (32.1 - 46.8) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. For each RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 case, 104 (87-126) infections were unreported. Background antibody reactivity was higher in pre-pandemic samples from Juba compared to Boston, where the serological test was validated. The estimated proportion of the population infected ranged from 30.1% to 60.6% depending on assumptions about test performance and prevalence of clinically severe infections.

375,Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins to viral pathogenicity in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, it is estimated that over 113 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 2.5 million human deaths have been recorded worldwide. Currently, three vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use only. However much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2, where we individually removed viral 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 ORF proteins, and characterized these recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF deficient ({Delta}ORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild-type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of {Delta}ORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the {Delta}ORF rSARS-CoV-2 identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while {Delta}ORF7a, {Delta}ORF7b and {Delta}ORF8 rSARS-CoV-2 induced comparable pathology to rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19.

IMPORTANCEDespite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remains elusive. Our study aims to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in viral pathogenesis and disease outcome, and develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse genetics system to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome.

377,Maximisation of open hospital capacity under shortage of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"MotiveThe Covid-19 pandemic has led to the novel situation that hospitals must prioritise staff for a vaccine rollout while there is acute shortage of the vaccine. In spite of the availability of guidelines from state agencies, there is partial confusion about what an optimal rollout plan is. This study investigates effects in a hospital model under different rollout schemes.

MethodsA simulation model is implemented in VBA and studied for parameter variation. The implemented code is available as open access supplement.

Main resultsA rollout scheme assigning vaccine doses to staff primarily by staffs pathogen exposure maximises the predicted open hospital capacity when compared to a rollout based on hierarchical prioritisation. The effect increases under resource scarcity and increasing disease activity. Nursing staff benefits most from an exposure focused rollout.

ConclusionsThe model employs SARS-CoV-2 parameters; nonetheless, effects observable in the model are transferable to other infectious diseases.

378,Quantified Flu: an individual-centered approach to gaining sickness-related insights from wearable data,"BackgroundWearables have been used widely for monitoring health in general and recent research results show that they can be used for predicting infections based on physiological symptoms. So far the evidence has been generated in large, population-based settings. In contrast, the Quantified Self and Personal Science communities are comprised of people interested in learning about themselves individually using their own data, often gathered via wearable devices.

ObjectiveWe explore how a co-creation process involving a heterogeneous community of personal science practitioners can develop a collective self-tracking system to monitor symptoms of infection alongside wearable sensor data.

MethodsWe engaged into a co-creation and design process with an existing community of personal science practitioners, jointly developing a working prototype of an online tool to perform symptom tracking. In addition to the iterative creation of the prototype (started on March 16, 2020), we performed a netnographic analysis, investigating the process of how this prototype was created in a decentralized and iterative fashion.

ResultsThe Quantified Flu prototype allows users to perform daily symptom reporting and is capable of visualizing those symptom reports on a timeline together with the resting heart rate, body temperature and respiratory rate as measured by wearable devices. We observe a high level of engagement, with over half of the 92 users that engaged in the symptom tracking becoming regular users, reporting over three months of data each. Furthermore, our netnographic analysis highlights how the current Quantified Flu prototype is a result of an interactive and continuous co-creation process in which new prototype releases spark further discussions of features and vice versa.

379,Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of respiratory Gram-negative bacterial isolates from COVID-19 patients in Switzerland,"BackgroundBacterial superinfections associated with COVID-19 are common in ventilated ICU patients and impact morbidity and lethality. However, the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to the manifestation of bacterial infections in these patients has yet to be elucidated.

MethodsWe collected 70 Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients in Zurich, Switzerland between March and May 2020. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF; antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by EUCAST disk diffusion and CLSI broth microdilution assays. Selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.

ResultsP. aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%) comprised the two largest etiologic groups. Drug resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates was high for piperacillin/tazobactam (65.6%), cefepime (56.3%), ceftazidime (46.9%) and meropenem (50.0%). Enterobacterales isolates showed slightly lower levels of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (32%), ceftriaxone (32%), and ceftazidime (36%). All P. aeruginosa isolates and 92% of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, with apramycin found to provide best-in-class coverage. Genotypic analysis of consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates in one patient revealed a frameshift mutation in the transcriptional regulator nalC that coincided with a phenotypic shift in susceptibility to {beta}-lactams and quinolones.

ConclusionsConsiderable levels of antimicrobial resistance may have contributed to the manifestation of bacterial superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients, and may in some cases mandate consecutive adaptation of antibiotic therapy. High susceptibility to amikacin and apramycin suggests that aminoglycosides may remain an effective second-line treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, provided efficacious drug exposure in lungs can be achieved.",Marina Gysin; Claudio Tirso Acevedo; Klara Haldimann; Elias Bodendoerfer; Frank Imkamp; Karl Bulut; Philipp Karl Buehler; Silvio Daniel Brugger; Katja Becker; Sven N.

380,The Value of Rapid Antigen Tests to Identify Carriers of Viable SARS-CoV-2.,"The search for effective methods to detect patients who excrete a viable virus is one of the urgent tasks of modern biomedicine. In the present study, we examined the diagnostic value of two antigen tests BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag (RapiGEN Inc., Korea) and SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag (Sugentech Inc., Korea) for their diagnostic value in identifying patients who excrete viable SARS-CoV-2. As part of the study, we examined samples from 106 patients who had just been admitted to the hospital, who had undergone quantitative RT-PCR and assessment of viability of SARS-CoV-2 using cell culture. Sensitivity was 0.786 (0.492-0.953) for SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag and 1 (0.768- 1) for Biocredit COVID-19 Ag. Specificity of rapid tests was significantly higher than that of RT-PCR and was 0.663 (0.557-0.758) and 0.674 (0.568-0.768) for SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag and Biocredit COVID-19 Ag versus 0.304 (0.213-0.409) obtained for PCR.

381,Higher viral load drives infrequent SARS-CoV-2 transmission between asymptomatic residence hall roommates,"In 2019-2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread to over 200 countries in less than six months. To understand the basis of this aggressive spread, it is essential to determine the transmission rate and define the factors that increase the risk of transmission. One complication is the large fraction of asymptomatic cases, particularly in young populations: these individuals have viral loads indistinguishable from symptomatic people and do transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they often go undetected. As university students living in residence halls commonly share a small living space with roommates, some schools established regular, high density testing programs to mitigate on-campus spread. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal testing data of residence hall students at the University of Colorado Boulder. We observed that students in single rooms were infected at a lower rate than students in multiple occupancy rooms. However, this was not due to high rates of transmission between roommates, which only occurred approximately 20% of the time. Since these cases were usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, this provides further evidence for asymptomatic transmission. Notably, individuals who likely transmitted to their roommates had an average viral load [~]6.5 times higher than individuals who did not. Although students were moved to separate isolation rooms after diagnosis, there was no difference in time to isolation between these cases with or without transmission. This analysis argues that inter-roommate transmission occurs in a minority of cases in university residence halls and provides strong correlative evidence that viral load can be proportional to the probability of transmission.",Kristen K Bjorkman; Tassa K Saldi; Erika Lasda; Leisha Conners Bauer; Jennifer Kovarik; Patrick K Gonzales; Morgan R Fink; Kimngang L Tat; Cole R Hager; Jack C Davis; Christopher D Ozeroff; Gloria R Brisson; Daniel B Larremore; Leslie A Leinwand; Matthew B McQueen; Roy Parker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253147,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253147,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
382,Global association of obesity and COVID-19 death rates,"ImportanceCOVID-19 was responsible for an enormous global death toll with large variation among countries.

ObjectiveTo examine the possible impact of obesity on COVID-19 death rates.

DesignMeasure associations between obesity rates in 2016 and COVID-19 deaths/million population through 2/25/2021, across countries.

SettingGlobal

Participants167 countries for which obesity and death data were available, grouped by population size, with multiples of 10 countries in each of 8 groups plus a group including all 57 countries with obesity rates <15%.

Outcome and measuresUsing Excel, COVID-19 deaths/million were regressed on the obesity rate for each country, based on obesity being a key factor in COVID hospitalizations and deaths. Using the least squares formula for the best fit for each model, R2, components of the formula, and the percentage of world population represented, were recorded for each group.

ResultsObesity rates ranged from 2.1% to 37.9% and death rates ranged from 0.4/million to 1,892/million for groups representing up to 91% of global population. Results for the 8 population groups had R2 from 0.30 to 0.90 with slopes of the fitted line ranging from 27.9-51.0. Countries with obesity rates <15% had consistently low death rates ([&le;]233/million), R2 of 0.003 and slope of the line=1.01.

ConclusionsFor most countries about one-third of the difference in COVID death rates was due to obesity while in countries with obesity <15%, consistently low death rates were not associated with obesity. Reduced obesity rates could potentially have lowered the COVID death toll.",Mary L Adams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253222,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253222,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
383,Analytical and clinical performances of a SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG assay: comparison with neutralization titers,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 serology presents an important role in understanding the virus epidemiology, in vaccine prioritization strategies and in convalescent plasma therapy. Immunoassays performances have to be accurately evaluated and correlated with neutralizing antibodies to be used as a surrogate measure of neutralizing activity. We investigate the analytical and clinical performance of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay, automated on a high throughput platform, and the correlation of the antibodies (Ab) levels with the plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT50) Ab titers.

MethodsA series of 546 samples were evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay (Snibe diagnostics), including 171 negative and 168 positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects and a further group of 207 subjects of the COVID-19 family clusters follow-up cohort.

ResultsAssay precision was acceptable at low and medium levels; linearity was excellent in all the measurement range. Considering specimens collected after 14 days post symptoms onset, overall sensitivity and specificity were 99.0% and 92.5%, respectively. A total of 281 leftover samples results of the PRNT50 test were available. An elevated correlation was obtained between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay and the PRNT50 titer at univariate (rho = 0.689) and multivariate (rho = 0.712) analyses.

384,An In-House ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 RBD uncovers elevatedimmune response at higher altitudes,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) first reported in Wuhan has caused a global pandemic with dramatic health and socioeconomic consequences. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated represents a challenge for health systems that had to quickly respond developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In the present work, we developed an ""In House"" ELISA with high sensitivity (92.2 %), specificity (100%) and precision (93.9%), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.991, rendering the assay as an excellent serological test to correctly discriminate between SARS-COv-2 infected and non-infected individuals and study population seroprevalence. Among 758 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the province of Tucuman, Argentina, we found a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5048 between antibodies elicited against the RBD and the nucleocapsid (N) antigen. Additionally, 33.6% of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 displayed mild levels of RBD-IgG antibodies, while 19% of the patients showed high antibody titers. Interestingly, patients with SARS-COV-2 infection over 60 years old elicited significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies against RBD compared to younger ones, while no difference was found between women and men. Surprisingly, individuals from a high altitude village displayed statistically significant higher and longer lasting anti-RBD antibodies compared to those from a city at a lower altitude, suggesting that a hypobaric hypoxia-adapted mechanism may act as a protective factor for COVID-19.

385,A Recovery Algorithm and Pooling Designs for One-Stage Noisy Group Testing under the Probabilistic Framework,"Group testing saves time and resources by testing each pre-assigned group instead of each individual, and one-stage group testing emerged as essential for cost-effectively controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the practical challenge of adjusting pooling designs based on infection rate has not been systematically addressed. In particular, there are both theoretical interests and practical motivation to analyze one-stage group testing at finite, practical problem sizes, rather than asymptotic ones, under noisy, rather than perfect tests, and when the number of positives is randomly distributed, rather than fixed.

Here, we study noisy group testing under the probabilistic framework by modeling the infection vector as a random vector with Bernoulli entries. Our main contributions include a practical one-stage group testing protocol guided by maximizing pool entropy and a maximum-likelihood recovery algorithm under the probabilistic framework. Our findings high-light the implications of introducing randomness to the infection vectors - we find that the combinatorial structure of the pooling designs plays a less important role than the parameters such as pool size and redundancy.",Yining Liu; Sachin Kadyan; Itsik Pe'er,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253193,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253193,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

While these studies have explored a variety of modeling techniques, all have relied on simulated data. Here, we use an empirical proximity network of college freshmen 10, ascertained using smartphone Bluetooth, to simulate the spread of the virus. We investigate the role of testing, isolation, mask wearing, and social distancing in the presence of implementation challenges and imperfect compliance. Here we show that while frequent testing can drastically reduce spread if mask wearing and social distancing are not widely adopted, testing has limited impact if they are ubiquitous. Furthermore, even moderate levels of immunity can significantly reduce new infections, especially when combined with other interventions. Our findings suggest that while testing and isolation are powerful tools, they have limited benefit if other interventions are widely adopted.

388,Rapid screening for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in clinical and environmental samples using nested RT-PCR assays targeting key mutations of the Spike protein,"New SARS-CoV-2 mutations are constantly emerging, raising concerns of increased transmissibility, virulence or escape from host immune response.

We describe a nested RT-PCR assay ([~]1500 bps) to detect multiple key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the three Variants of Concern (VOCs) 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20J/501Y.V3 (Brazil), as well as the 20E.EU1 variant (Spain), the CAL.20C recently identified in California, and the mink-associated variant (GR, lineage B.1.1.298). Prior to application to field samples, the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage, where the amplification of long fragments is problematic, two short nested RT-PCR assays ([~]300 bps) were also designed, targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay.

The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples, including 7 fully-sequenced viral isolates from swab samples and 34 urban wastewater samples, some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported.

The long assay successfully amplified all the previously characterized viral isolates, allowing the correct identification of variants 20I/501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs (UK and Brazilian variant) and of other variant (Spanish) were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20J/501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters, highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity.

The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest. This can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens. The assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost-effective detection of VOCs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater-based epidemiology. The approach proposed here can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity, geographic distribution and impact worldwide.",Giuseppina La Rosa; Pamela Mancini; Giusy Bonanno Ferraro; Carolina Veneri; Marcello Iaconelli; Luca Lucentini; Lucia Bonadonna; Silvio Brusaferro; David Brandtner; Antonio Fasanella; Lorenzo Pace; Antonio Parisi; Domenico Galante; Elisabetta Suffredini,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252450,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252450,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
389,Therapeutic Anticoagulation in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19-Preliminary Report,"BackgroundThrombosis may contribute to morbidity and mortality in Covid-19. We hypothesized that therapeutic anticoagulation would improve outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19.

MethodsWe conducted an open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized, clinical trial. Patients with severe Covid-19, defined as the requirement for organ support with high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, vasopressors, or inotropes, were randomized to receive therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin or pharmacological thromboprophylaxis as per local usual care. The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21.

ResultsTherapeutic anticoagulation met the pre-defined criteria for futility in patients with severe Covid-19. The primary outcome was available for 1,074 participants (529 randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation and 545 randomized to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis). Median organ support-free days were 3 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and 5 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio 0.87, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.70-1.08, posterior probability of futility [odds ratio<1.2] 99.8%). Hospital survival was comparable between groups (64.3% vs. 65.3%, adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% CrI 0.67-1.16). Major bleeding occurred in 3.1% of patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and 2.4% of patients assigned to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

ConclusionsIn patients with severe Covid-19, therapeutic anticoagulation did not improve hospital survival or days free of organ support compared to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

390,Model Based Estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 Immunization Level in Austria and Consequences for Herd Immunity Effects,"Several systemic factors indicate, that worldwide herd immunity against COVID-19 will probably not be achieved in 2021. Vaccination programs are limited by availability of doses, the number of people already infected is still too low to have a disease preventing impact and new emerging variants of the virus seem to partially neglect developed antibodies from previous infections. Nevertheless, after one year of COVID-19 observing high numbers of reported cases in most European countries, we might expect that the immunization level should have an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We used an agent-based simulation model to reproduce the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria to estimate the immunization level of the population as of February 2021. We ran several simulations of an uncontrolled epidemic wave with varying initial immunization scenarios to assess the effect on the effective reproduction number. We also used a classic differential equation SIR-model to cross-validate the simulation model. As of February 2021, 14.7% of the Austrian population has been affected by a SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes a 9% reduction of the effective reproduction number and a 24.7% reduction of the prevalence peak compared to a fully susceptible population. This estimation is now recomputed on a regular basis to publish model based analysis of immunization level in Austria also including the fast growing effects of vaccination programs. This provides substantial information for decision makers to evaluate the necessity of NPI-measures based on the estimated impact of natural and vaccinated immunization.",Martin Richard Bicher; Claire Rippinger; Günter Richard Schneckenreither; Nadine Weibrecht; Christoph Urach; Melanie Zechmeister; Dominik Brunmeir; Wolfgang Huf; Niki Popper,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253251,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253251,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
391,"Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated risk factors among frontline health care workers in Paris, France: the SEROCOV prospective cohort study","BackgroundWith the COVID-19 pandemic, documenting whether health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and identifying risk factors is of major concern.

MethodsIn this multicenter prospective cohort study, HCWs from frontline departments were included in March and April 2020 and followed for 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed at month 0 (M0), M1, and M3 and RT-PCR in case of symptoms. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Risk factors of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 were identified by multivariate logistic regression.

ResultsAmong 1,062 HCWs (median [interquartile range] age, 33 [28-42] years; 758 [71.4%] women; 321 [30.2%] physicians), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 was 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [12.5; 16.9]). Risk factors were the working department specialty, with increased risk for intensive care units (odds ratio 1.80, 95%CI [0.38; 8.58]), emergency departments (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and infectious diseases departments (4.22 [0.92; 18.28]); active smoking was associated with reduced risk (0.36 [0.21; 0.63]). Age, sex, professional category, number of years of experience in the job or department, and public transportation use were not significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3.

ConclusionThe rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in frontline HCWs was 14.6% at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in Paris and occurred mainly early. The study argues for an origin of professional in addition to private life contamination and therefore including HCWs in the first-line vaccination target population. It also highlights that smokers were at lower risk.

Here we show that, like other SARS-CoV-2 strains, lineage B.1.1.7 spread with greater transmission in colder and more densely populated parts of England. However, we also find evidence of B.1.1.7 having a transmission advantage at warmer temperatures compared to other strains. This implies that spring and summer conditions are unlikely to slow B.1.1.7s invasion in Europe and across the Northern hemisphere - an important consideration for public health interventions.",Thomas P Smith; Ilaria Dorigatti; Swapnil Mishra; Erik Volz; Patrick G T Walker; Manon Ragonnet-Cronin; Michael Tristem; William D Pearse,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253242,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253242,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
393,"Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Arab Emirates reveals novel virus mutation, patterns of co-infection and tissue specific host responses","BackgroundThe United Arab Emirates is a major business hub with substantial amount of international travel. Like many other countries, it was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic since late January 2020, with recurring waves of infection. This study aimed at combining genomic and epidemiological data to unravel the source of SARS-CoV-2 introduction, transmission and evolution in the country.

MethodsWe performed meta-transcriptomic sequencing of 1,067 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from qRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients in Abu Dhabi, UAE, between May 9th and June 29th 2020. We investigated the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of the viral population and analyzed the infection and transmission potential of novel genomic clusters. Within-host SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation was analyzed to determine the occurrence and prevalence of multiple infections. Finally, we evaluated innate host responses during the prolonged period of local infection.

ResultsAll globally known SARS-CoV-2 clades were identified within the UAE sequenced strains, with a higher occurrence of European and East Asian clades. We defined 5 subclades based on 11 unique genetic variants within the UAE strains, which were associated with no significantly different viral loads. Multiple infection of different SARS-CoV-2 strains was observed for at least 5% of the patients. We also discovered an enrichment of cytosine-to-uracil mutation among the viral population collected from the nasopharynx, that is different from the adenosine-to-inosine change previously observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. This observation is accompanied with an upregulation of APOBEC4, an under-studied putative cytidine-uridine editing enzyme in the infected nasopharynx.

ConclusionsThe genomic epidemiological and molecular biological knowledge obtained in the study provides new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission. We highlight the importance of sustained surveillance of the virus mutation using genomic sequencing as a public health strategy.",Rong Liu; Pei Wu; Pauline Ogrodzki; Sally Mahmoud; Ke Liang; Pengjuan Liu; Stephen S.

394,COVID-19: Optimal Allocation of Ventilator Supply under Uncertainty and Risk,"This study presents a new risk-averse multi-stage stochastic epidemics-ventilator-logistics compartmental model to address the resource allocation challenges of mitigating COVID-19. This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.",Xuecheng Yin; I.

395,Immune response during lactation after anti-SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine,"ImportanceData regarding efficacy and safety of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during lactation is needed to address vaccination guidelines, ease vaccine hesitancy concerns, and inform public health strategies for this population.

ObjectiveTo determine whether anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines administered during lactation illicit an immune response or the transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies into human milk.

DesignPlasma and milk samples were collected from a prospective cohort of lactating individuals who received the mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 and from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 infection.

SettingAmbulatory or during postpartum hospitalization.

ParticipantsWe report results from lactating participants who received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna, n=9) or the BNT162b2 (Pfizer, n=14) vaccine or recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=3).

Interventions and ExposuresAnti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273) or natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Plasma and milk samples were collected from lactating individuals before first vaccine dose, on the day of the second dose, and 4 weeks after the second dose. Maternal plasma was evaluated for vaccine-derived IgM and IgG antibodies. Human milk was evaluated by ELISA for vaccine-induced IgA antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsTwenty-three lactating individuals were recruited for this study. Levels of IgG and IgM were significantly increased in plasma samples on the day of the second vaccine dose (post vaccine 1), when compared to pre-vaccine samples. In addition, plasma IgG levels 4 weeks after second vaccine dose were significantly higher than plasma IgG levels pre-vaccine or on the day of the second dose. In addition, our results show transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgA antibodies to human milk, 3-4 weeks after each dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273). The levels of anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA antibody in milk of vaccinated individuals were not significantly different from levels among participants who experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions and RelevanceAdministration of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during lactation leads to increased anti-SARS-CoV2 IgM and IgG levels in the plasma of lactating mothers and increased anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA levels in human milk. Lactating women who receive the vaccine should continue breastfeeding their infant human milk to allow continuing transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies to the neonate. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of these vaccines on lactation outcomes and infant health.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the immunologic response to anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines during lactation and does vaccination induce secretion of IgA antibodies into human milk?

FindingsIn a cohort of 23 lactating individuals who were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found significantly increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgM antibodies in plasma, as well as anti-SARS-CoV2 IgA in human milk.

396,The impact of the UK's first COVID-19 lockdown on rates of violence and aggression on psychiatric inpatient wards,"AimsInpatient life in UK mental health hospitals was profoundly altered during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed whether these changes impacted the rate of violent and aggressive incidents across acute adult wards and psychiatric intensive care units in a South London NHS Mental Health Trust during the first UK lockdown.

MethodsWe used an interrupted time series analysis to assess whether the rate of violent and aggressive incidents changed during the lockdown period from 23rd March 2020 to 15th June 2020. We used a quasi-poisson general additive model to model the weekly rate of violent incidents as a function of a seasonal trend, time trend, and impact of lockdown, using data from 1st January 2017 to 27th September 2020.

ResultsThere was a 35% increase in the rate of incidents of violence and aggression [IR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.58, p < 0.001] between March 23rd 2020 and June 15th 2020. In addition, there was strong evidence of temporal (p < 0.001) and seasonal trends (p < 0.001).

397,Acceptability of contact management and care of simple cases of COVID-19 at home: a mixed-method study in Senegal,"IntroductionIn mid-2020, due to the health system challenges from increased COVID-19 cases, the Ministry of Health and Social Action in Senegal opted for contact management and care of simple cases at home. The studys objective was to determine the acceptability of contact management, home care of simple cases of COVID-19, and its associated factors.

MethodThis was a sequential mixed-method study. We collected data from June 11, 2020, to July 10, 2020, for the quantitative survey (N=813) and from August 24 to September 16, 2020, for the qualitative survey (N=30). We carried out a sampling strategy using marginal quotas at the national level. We collected data using a structured questionnaire in a telephone interview for the quantitative survey and using an interview guide formulated from the quantitative surveys initial results for the qualitative data. We assessed acceptability using binomial logistic regression combined with content analysis.

ResultsThe care of simple cases of COVID-19 at home was well accepted (78.5%). This result was justified for some (saturation of the health system) but not for others (risk of contamination). The use of home contact management was less accepted (51.4%), with risk limitation as the main reason given. The acceptability of home-based care for simple cases was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.55 [95%CI: 1.04,2.28]), regular research into COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.12 [95%CI: 1.45,3.12]), belief in the existence of treatment (ORaj: 1.82 [95%CI: 1.19,2.83]), and confidence in institutional information (ORaj: 2.10 [95%CI: 1.43,3.10]). The acceptability of home-based contact management was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.77 [95%CI: 1.27,2.48]), regular research for information on COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.39 [95%CI: 1.76,3.26]), and confidence in the government in the fight against the epidemic (ORaj: 1.51 [95%CI: 1.10,2.08]).

ConclusionRegular information on the disease, knowledge of its mode of transmission and trust in institutions are factors in accepting COVID-19 management at the community level.

398,An Extended COVID-19 Epidemiological Model with Vaccination and Multiple Interventions for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK,"There has been a second outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the UK in 2020. In this situation, the UK re-implemented the lockdown intervention strategy. Different from the first COVID outbreak, the second outbreak is accompanied by two new situations: 1) There are at least three new variant strains in the UK and they are more infectious than the original strain. The mutant strain considered in the experimental simulation accounts for the majority of all strains of the mutant infection in the UK. 2) The official start of a vaccination programme in the UK started in mid-December 2020. As the date for lifting the third lockdown approaches, what kind of intervention measures will the UK continue to take: curb the spread of the COVID epidemic, reduce medical needs and allow people to return to normal life and revitalize the national economy as quickly as possible. Targeting at this problem, this article conduct a feasibility study by defining the mathematical model SEMCVRD (Susceptible [S], Exposed [E] (infected but asymptomatic), Mild [M] and Critical [C] (mild cases, severe and critical cases), [V] (vaccinated), Recovered [R] and Deceased [D]), which is expanded the traditional SEIR (Susceptible [S], Exposed [E], Infectious [I], Recovered [R]) model by adding two key features: the mixed infection of the mutant strain and the original strain and the addition of a new group who have been vaccinated. The model uses a public data set for fitting and evaluation. The dataset contains daily new infections, new deaths and daily vaccination in the UK from February 2020 to February 2021. Based on the simulation results, the following content was found : 1) There are simulated the mixed infection of the new mutant virus and the original virus in the UK. Under the assumption that the vaccine is effective against the new virus, continuing to promote the injection of the vaccine in society can effectively inhibit the spread and infection of the new mutant virus. Predicting that if UK could continuously implement insensitive suppression, COVID-19 epidemic would be able to control by 9th April 2021 and would be nearly ended by 1st May 2020. 2) With the increasing number of people vaccinated and immunized against the virus, the lifting of the third lockdown in the UK is coming. Using a phased and progressive lifting intervention strategy with an intensity of 3 is our best choice at present. Under this strategy, on 30th June 2021, the total number of infections in the UK will be limited to 4.2 million and the total number of deaths in the UK is 135 thousand. If the lockdown is lifted directly, the total number of infections in the UK will increase to 8 million and the total number of deaths in the UK will be 279 thousand on 30th June 2021. It can be seen from the above that our strategy compared to directly lifting the lockdown can greatly reduce the total number of infections and deaths. People can return to normal life and social distancing after four months. The epidemic will nearly end in 6th June 2021 (The sign of the end: the number of new infections per day is less than 1,000 and the number of new deaths per day is less than 35). In addition, according to our prediction, under this kind of intervention, the UK will not experience a shortage of medical resources as it did in the first half of 2020. 3) In the case that it is possible to provide people with 600 thousand vaccinations(double the quantity now provided) every day, a higher intensity (intensity 5) Phase intervention strategy can be trying to nearly end the epidemic earlier (25th May 2021) and restore peoples normal life and social distance.",Shuhao Zhang; Gaoshan Bi; Yun Yang; Jun Qi; Shujun Li; Xuxin Mao; Ruoling Peng; Po Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252748,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252748,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
399,A phase 2 study of the inhaled pan-JAK inhibitor TD-0903 in severe COVID-19: Part 1,"BackgroundLung-targeted anti-inflammatory therapy could potentially improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The novel inhaled pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor TD-0903 was designed to optimise delivery to the lungs while limiting systemic exposure. Here, we report results from the completed Part 1 of a 2-part phase 2 trial (NCT04402866) in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19.

MethodsPart 1 explored 3 doses of TD-0903 (1, 3, and 10 mg once-daily for 7 days) and placebo in a randomised, double-blind, ascending-dose study. Each dose cohort comprised 8 hospitalized patients (6:2 TD-0903:placebo) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen and receiving background standard-of-care therapy. Key objectives included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; clinical outcomes were also explored. Data were summarised as descriptive statistics.

ResultsTwenty-five patients were randomised to receive TD-0903 1 mg (n = 6), 3 mg (n = 7), 10 mg (n = 6), or placebo (n = 6). Almost all patients (92%) received background dexamethasone; 3 (12%) received remdesivir. TD-0903 was generally well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. Low plasma concentrations of TD-0903 were observed at all doses. Clinically favourable numerical trends in patients receiving TD-0903 vs placebo included improved 8-point clinical status, shortened hospitalisation, improved oxygenation, and fewer deaths.

ConclusionsIn Part 1 of this phase 2 trial, the novel inhaled JAK inhibitor TD-0903 showed potential for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.

402,Development and validation of a clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of severe COVID-19,"Age, sex, and comorbidities are known risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are frequently considered independently and without accurate knowledge of the magnitude of their effects on risk. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk of severe COVID-19 have appeared in the literature, but their application in predictive risk testing has not been validated. Reliance on age and sex alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will fail to accurately quantify risk. Here, we report the development and validation of a clinical and genetic model to predict risk of severe COVID-19 using confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive participants from the UK Biobank. Our new model out-performed an age and sex model and had excellent discrimination and was well calibrated in the validation dataset. We also report validation studies of our prototype model and polygenic risk scores based on 8-SNP and 6-SNP panels identified in the literature.

Out of 1,751 total samples analyzed, 846 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with overall viral concentrations declining from April to May. Wastewater viral titers were consistent with, and appeared to precede, clinical COVID-19 surveillance indicators, including daily new cases. Wastewater surveillance had a high detection rate (>80%) of SARS-CoV-2 when the daily incidence exceeded 13 per 100,000 people. Detection rates were positively associated with wastewater treatment plant catchment size.

404,The BioNTech / Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 induces class-switched SARS-CoV-2-specific plasma cells and potential memory B cells as well as IgG and IgA serum and IgG saliva antibodies upon the first immunization,"To treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that enters the body through the respiratory tract, different vaccines in particular against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein have been developed or are in the development process. For the BioNTech / Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, which is injected twice, protection against COVID-19 has been described for the first weeks after the second vaccination. The underlying mechanisms of defense and the long-term effectiveness of this vaccine against COVID-19 are currently under investigation.

In addition to the induction of systemic antibodies (Abs), Ab responses in the respiratory tract would help to form a first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, protection depends on Fab-part-dependent neutralizing capacities, however, Fc-part-mediated effector mechanisms might also be important. Long-term defense would be based on the induction of long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells (PCs) and memory B cells.

Here, we established different assays to analyze anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG and IgA Abs in blood serum and saliva as well as SARS-CoV-2-S1-reactive IgG and IgA PCs and potential memory B cells in the blood of individuals upon their first immunization with BNT162b2.

We show that the vaccine induces in particular anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG1 and IgG3 as well as IgA1 and in some individuals also IgG2 and IgA2 serum Abs. In the saliva, we found no anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgA, but instead IgG Abs. Furthermore, we found SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgG+ blood PCs and potential memory B cells as well as SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgA+ PCs and/or potential memory B cells in some individuals.

Our data suggest that the vaccine induces a promising CD4+ T cell-dependent systemic IgG1 and IgG3 Ab response with IgG+ PCs and potential memory B cells.

405,Bayesian inference across multiple models suggests a strong increase in lethality of COVID-19 in late 2020 in the UK,"We apply Bayesian inference methods to a suite of distinct compartmental models of generalised SEIR type, in which diagnosis and quarantine are included via extra compartments. We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK, using age-structured, weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a (step-like or graded) change in infection fatality rate (IFR) have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover, they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However, the same models consistently infer that, most probably, the increase in IFR preceded the time window during which new variant B.1.1.7 became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore, according to our models, the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality of a new variant. We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France, which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period, despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant(s) may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020, other factors, such as seasonality, or pressure on health services, are likely to also have contributed.

SummaryO_ST_ABSModel structureC_ST_ABSWe study a family of non-geographic compartmented models structured by age, and by epidemiological and diagnostic state. They include stages within exposed (E) and infected (I) classes, and separation of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals; E and I classes are subdivided according to whether they have had a positive test.

Disease transmission between compartments is modelled by contact matrices derived from survey data and previous Bayesian inference [1]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are incorporated via time- and age-dependent transmission rates. This dependence is parameterised by functions that account for lockdowns, seasonal changes, etc., with parameters inferred from the data except where known a priori (e.g. lockdown dates).

The process of diagnosis is modelled explicitly through the subdivided compartments. The targeting of tests towards symptomatic individuals is controlled by a single inferred parameter. Tested individuals have reduced infectivity, as a model for self-isolation. The fraction of asymptomatic cases is presumed fixed. Most other parameters are inferred (including initial conditions in March 2020). Our models are stochastic at all stages, including the infection and the diagnosis processes.

Similar models are considered for Germany and France. All models are analysed with the same Bayesian methodology as outlined below.

DataWe analyse age-structured, weekly data for cases and mortalities for the UK, France and Germany starting in early March 2020. Our explicit modelling of diagnostic tests allows us to directly use data on the number of daily tests performed and their outcomes to inform parameter estimation. For the UK, the data we used are (i) ONS data for COVID deaths; (ii) PHE data for total numbers of tests; (iii) PHE data for numbers of positive tests. The time series analysed extends from March 2020 until January 2021.

MethodsIn line with the data used, we treat diagnosed cases and mortalities as the only observables; other compartments are treated as unobserved, with occupancies to be inferred from data. Parameters governing overdispersion for infection and death are likewise inferred.

We perform inference using a likelihood function that includes the stochasticity in all model transitions (infection, disease progression, testing, death). The likelihood of the observed data is computed in an approximation that becomes exact for large population sizes, taking into account all statistical dependencies in this limit. Inference is performed at the level of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. Using these MAP estimates we approximate the evidence for each model, allowing us to compare the credibility of different models given the same set of data.

We use the software package PyRoss to build all the models and run the inference procedure [2, 3].

Model specificationsWe compare several distinct models that differ primarily in how interventions and fluctuations are addressed. Some of these variants (Type 1) allow for a time-dependent infection fatality rate (IFR) and some do not (Type 0). Most of our Type 1 models assume a step change in IFR but a ramped (tanh) variation is also studied. In Type 1 models, the values of IFR before and after the change are parameterised in terms of their log-ratio, whose prior is normal distributed with mean zero and standard deviation log(3). The prior for the time of the change is normal with mean 2020-12-12 and standard deviation 2 weeks.

For both Type 0 and Type 1 models we consider several possibilities for the time-dependence of model parameters other than the IFR. For the UK, these are (A) no dependence; (B) changing infectivity; (C) changing overdispersion: (BC) changing infectivity and overdispersion.

FindingsType 1 models for the UK consistently attain a significantly higher model evidence than Type 0 models. (Specifically, they show systematically larger values of the log-posterior.) For each Type 1 model, we separately infer that in the UK, the IFR rose by a factor of about two in late October or early November 2020: the MAP values vary between 1.9-2.2 depending on the model chosen. A similar change is also inferred in Germany and France, but is somewhat less pronounced.

Among the France/Germany models, the ratios of inferred IFRs before/after the step are smaller than in UK but still indicate significant changes, around 1.4 for France and 1.8 for Germany.

The IFR changes in UK are inferred to take place significantly before the B.1.1.7 variant became the dominant UK strain. The significant inferred IFR change in Germany is (to our knowledge) not associated with any new variant.

InterpretationThese findings support the hypothesis [4-6] that the lethality of COVID-19 in the UK increased significantly in late autumn 2020. The MAP estimates further suggest that a larger increase than previously suggested [4, 5], of roughly a factor 2, arose with an onset time in early November. However, the fact that this onset time precedes the rise to dominance of new variant B.1.1.7 suggests that this rise is not solely responsible for the change in IFR. Other factors, such as seasonality and/or pressure on health services, may also be important. If these factors came into play significantly before the arrival of B.1.1.7, then the MAP-estimated onset time of early November could represent a compromise between two successive episodes of increasing IFR within models that, as so far implemented, allow only one.

Note that the IFR depends on the true number of infections (not just diagnosed cases as in the case fatality rate) which, in our model, is itself estimated from the data for cases and testing. Underestimation of this number can lead to an overestimate of the IFR. However, to explain the factor-two increase in fitted IFR this way would require implausible assumptions to be made concerning change in testing efficacy in late autumn 2020 (models TT0, TT1, P0).",Patrick Pietzonka; Erik Brorson; William Bankes; Michael E Cates; Robert L Jack; Ronojoy Adhikari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253311,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253311,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
406,Disulfiram associated with lower risk of Covid-19: a retrospective cohort study,"In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is a substantial need for effective, low-cost therapeutics. We investigated the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in an observational study in a large database of US Veterans Administration clinical records, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). The study is motivated by the unique properties of disulfiram, which has been used as an anti-alcoholism drug since 1948, is non-toxic, easy to manufacture and inexpensive. Disulfiram reduces hyperinflammation in mammalian cells by inhibition of the gasdermin D pore. In a mouse model of sepsis, disulfiram reduced inflammatory cytokines and mortality. Disulfiram also is a low micromolar inhibitor of the Mpro and PLpro viral proteases of SARS-CoV-2.

To investigate the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and severity of COVID-19, we carried out an epidemiological study in the CDW. The VA dataset used has 944,127 patients tested for SARS-Cov-2, 167,327 with a positive test, and 2,233 on disulfiram, of which 188 had a positive SARS-Cov-2 test. A multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorders, and Charlson comorbidity score revealed a reduced incidence of COVID-19 with disulfiram use with a hazard ratio of 0.66 and 95% confidence interval of 0.57 to 0.76 (P < 0.001). There were no deaths among the 188 SARS-Cov-2 positive patients treated with disulfiram. The expected number of deaths would have been 5-6 according to the 3% death rate among the untreated (P-value 0.03).

Our finding of a lower hazard ratio and less severe outcomes for COVID-19 in patients treated with disulfiram compared to those not treated is a statistical association and does not prove any causative effect of disulfiram. However, the results of this study suggest that there is a pharmacological contribution to the reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19 with the use of disulfiram. Given the known anti-inflammatory and viral anti-protease effects of disulfiram, it is reasonable and urgent to initiate accelerated clinical trials to assess whether disulfiram reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity and death.

STRUCTURED OUTLINEO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSIdentifying already approved medications with well characterized antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties supported by real world evidence as candidates for clinical trials for repurposing is an important strategy to manage the pandemic given the ongoing challenges with producing and administering vaccines, the emergence of more infectious viral mutants and the paucity of approved therapies.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe results of this study suggest that disulfiram use contributes to a reduced incidence of COVID-19.

407,Repeated Testing Necessary: Assessing Negative Predictive Value of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR in a Population of Young Adults,"Determining when individuals should be released from quarantine is critical for successfully managing a COVID-19 outbreak and local protocols frequently call for testing during the quarantine period, generally after a reasonable incubation period, which raises a question about the interpretation of test results during the quarantine period. We report the negative predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR tests based on a retrospective longitudinal analysis of 5349 qPCR tests collected from 1227 US service members infected with COVID-19 aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) aircraft carrier. In our retrospective evaluation of recovering qPCR-positive quarantined crew members undergoing repeated testing, the negative predictive value is 80% for tests occurring as late as seven weeks following an initial positive qPCR test result. Repeated qPCR testing is necessary to ensure that a once-infected person is no longer shedding viral RNA.

408,Spread and sources of information and misinformation about COVID-19 early during the pandemic in a U.S. national cohort study,"BackgroundEarly in the pandemic, misinformation about COVID-19 was spread on social media. The purpose of this study was to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information and claims seen and believed about COVID-19 early in the pandemic among U.S. adults. Then, we assessed the impact of believing such claims on engaging in personal protective actions (PPA).

MethodsWe used baseline data from the CHASING COVID Cohort (n = 7,070) collected March 28, 2020 to April 20, 2020 to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information as well as claims circulating on social media that had been seen and believed. We used Poisson regression to determine the association of believing certain claims with engaging in a higher number of PPA.

ResultsThe top three trusted sources of COVID-19 information were the CDC (67.9%), the WHO (53.7%), and State Health Departments (53.0%). Several COVID-19 claims circulated on social media had been seen, e.g., that the virus was created in a laboratory (54.8%). Moreover, substantial proportions of participants indicated agreement with some of these claims. In multivariable regression, we found that belief in certain claims was associated with engaging in a higher number of PPA. For example, believing that paper masks would prevent transmission of the virus was associated with engaging in a higher number of protective actions ({beta} = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.004 - 0.046).

409,The impact of headache disorders on COVID-19 survival: a world population-based analysis,"ImportanceCOVID-19 has not impacted people or countries uniformly. This disparity has prompted investigations to identify clinical and genetic predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Headache, a COVID-19 symptom, has been associated with positive disease prognosis. It is logical to consider whether primary headache disorders, among the most prevalent and disabling diseases globally, may also be associated with reduced viral mortality and thereby may have arisen as adaptive host defences

ObjectiveTo study the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and primary headache disorders.

Main outcome measureUsing a generalized additive model regression (GAM), we analysed data across 171 nations to identify variables which impact COVID-19 mortality rates (demographics, national wealth and government effectiveness, pandemic management indexes, latitude of the countrys capital, prevalence of headache disorders and other diseases). We performed similar analyses of seasonal influenza mortality. Separately, we meta-analysed studies of COVID-19 inpatient survival reporting headache, using PRISMA guidelines.

ResultsIn the global population-level analysis, we observed that a higher prevalence of headache disorders was associated with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate, and represented the main variable contributing to differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between countries (37.8%; F value=10.68). By contrast, we observed a negative trend between the prevalence of headache disorders and influenza death rates. Controversially, when considering headache as a symptom of COVID-19, in the 48 meta-analysed studies we observed a significantly higher risk ratio of survival (RR:2.178 [1.882-2.520], p<0.0001) among COVID-19 inpatients with headache.

Conclusions and RelevanceHeadache as a primary disorder is more prevalent in nations with higher COVID-19 mortality, whereas headache as a COVID-19 symptom is associated with enhanced survival. Further studies should clarify whether primary headache disorders represent a risk factor for mortality for COVID-19 or, rather, whether this association reflects evolutionary adaptive processes to enhance survival that, in the case of COVID-19, are insufficiently protective.",Robert E.

410,Mapping the human genetic architecture of COVID-19 by worldwide meta-analysis,"The genetic makeup of an individual contributes to susceptibility and response to viral infection. While environmental, clinical and social factors play a role in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease severity, host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors indicate biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprising 49,562 COVID-19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries worldwide. We reported 15 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. We further identified smoking and body mass index as causal risk factors for severe COVID-19. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19, with unprecedented speed, was enabled by prioritization of shared resources and analytical frameworks.

Our approach allows for rigorous confounding adjustment and provides highly spatio-temporally resolved effect estimates. We find that, with the exception of the Southwest, most of the US experienced increases in PM2.5 during lockdown, compared to the concentrations expected under business-as-usual. To investigate possible drivers of this phenomenon, we use regression to characterize the relationship of many environmental, geographical, meteorological, mobility, and socioeconomic factors with the lockdown-attributable changes in PM2.5.

412,Impact of close interpersonal contact on COVID-19 incidence: evidence from one year of mobile device data,"Close contact between people is the primary route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to quantify interpersonal contact at the population-level by using anonymized mobile device geolocation data. We computed the frequency of contact (within six feet) between people in Connecticut during February 2020 - January 2021. Then we aggregated counts of contact events by area of residence to obtain an estimate of the total intensity of interpersonal contact experienced by residents of each town for each day. When incorporated into a susceptible-exposed-infective-removed (SEIR) model of COVID-19 transmission, the contact rate accurately predicted COVID-19 cases in Connecticut towns during the timespan. The pattern of contact rate in Connecticut explains the large initial wave of infections during March-April, the subsequent drop in cases during June-August, local outbreaks during August-September, broad statewide resurgence during September-December, and decline in January 2021. Contact rate data can help guide public health messaging campaigns to encourage social distancing and in the allocation of testing resources to detect or prevent emerging local outbreaks more quickly than traditional case investigation.

413,"High household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States: living density, viral load, and disproportionate impact on communities of color","BackgroundFew prospective studies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households have been reported from the United States, where COVID-19 cases are the highest in the world and the pandemic has had disproportionate impact on communities of color.

Methods and FindingsThis is a prospective observational study. Between April-October 2020, the UNC CO-HOST study enrolled 102 COVID-positive persons and 213 of their household members across the Piedmont region of North Carolina, including 45% who identified as Hispanic/Latinx or non-white. Households were enrolled a median of 6 days from onset of symptoms in the index case. Secondary cases within the household were detected either by PCR of a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab on study day 1 and weekly nasal swabs (days 7, 14, 21) thereafter, or based on seroconversion by day 28. After excluding household contacts exposed at the same time as the index case, the secondary attack rate (SAR) among susceptible household contacts was 60% (106/176, 95% CI 53%-67%). The majority of secondary cases were already infected at study enrollment (73/106), while 33 were observed during study follow-up. Despite the potential for continuous exposure and sequential transmission over time, 93% (84/90, 95% CI 86%-97%) of PCR-positive secondary cases were detected within 14 days of symptom onset in the index case, while 83% were detected within 10 days. Index cases with high NP viral load (>10^6 viral copies/ul) at enrollment were more likely to transmit virus to household contacts during the study (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3-18 p=0.02). Furthermore, NP viral load was correlated within families (ICC=0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.60), meaning persons in the same household were more likely to have similar viral loads, suggesting an inoculum effect. High household living density was associated with a higher risk of secondary household transmission (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.3-55) for households with >3 persons occupying <6 rooms (SAR=91%, 95% CI 71-98%). Index cases who self-identified as Hispanic/Latinx or non-white were more likely to experience a high living density and transmit virus to a household member, translating into an SAR in minority households of 70%, versus 52% in white households (p=0.05).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 transmits early and often among household members. Risk for spread and subsequent disease is elevated in high-inoculum households with limited living space. Very high infection rates due to household crowding likely contribute to the increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and morbidity observed among racial and ethnic minorities in the US. Quarantine for 14 days from symptom onset of the first case in the household is appropriate to prevent onward transmission from the household. Ultimately, primary prevention through equitable distribution of effective vaccines is of paramount importance.

417,Specific allelic discrimination of N501Y and other SARS-CoV-2 mutations by ddPCR detects B.1.1.7 lineage in Washington State,"Real-time epidemiological tracking of variants of interest can help limit the spread of more contagious forms of SARS-CoV-2, such as those containing the N501Y mutation. Typically, genetic sequencing is required to be able to track variants of interest in real-time. However, sequencing can take time and may not be accessible in all laboratories. Genotyping by RT-ddPCR offers an alternative to sequencing to rapidly detect variants of concern through discrimination of specific mutations such as N501Y that is associated with increased transmissibility. Here we describe the first cases of the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Washington State by using a combination of RT-PCR, RT-ddPCR, and next-generation sequencing. We screened 1,035 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by our CDC-based laboratory developed assay using ThermoFishers multiplex RT-PCR COVID-19 assay over four weeks from late December 2020 to early January 2021. S gene dropout candidates were subsequently assayed by RT-ddPCR to confirm four mutations within the S gene associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage: a deletion at amino acid (AA) 69-70 (ACATGT), deletion at AA 145, (TTA), N501Y mutation (TAT), and S982A mutation (GCA). All four targets were detected in two specimens, and follow-up sequencing revealed a total of 10 mutations in the S gene and phylogenetic clustering within the B.1.1.7 lineage. As variants of concern become increasingly prevalent, molecular diagnostic tools like RT-ddPCR can be utilized to quickly, accurately, and sensitively distinguish more contagious lineages of SARS-CoV-2.",Garrett A.

418,SARS-CoV-2 Serology Status Detected by Commercialized Platforms Distinguishes Previous Infection and Vaccination Adaptive Immune Responses,"BackgroundThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 110 million individuals and led to 2.5 million deaths worldwide. As more individuals are vaccinated, the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms needs to be evaluated.

MethodsThe ability of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms to detect previous infection or vaccination were evaluated using a cohort of 53 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, 89 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated healthcare workers (Pfizer or Moderna), and 127 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Serology results were compared to a cell based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) neutralizing antibodies assay.

ResultsThe Roche S-(spike) antibody and Diazyme neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) assays detected adaptive immune response in 100.0% and 90.1% of vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of vaccine (initial and booster), respectively. The Roche N-(nucleocapsid) antibody assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect adaptive immune response in vaccinated individuals. The Diazyme Nabs assay correlated with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 neutralization titers (R2= 0.70), while correlation of the Roche S-antibody assay was weaker (R2= 0.39). Median PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 titers more than doubled in vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of the Moderna vaccine (ID50: 597) compared to individuals that received a single dose (ID50: 284).

ConclusionsThe Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays robustly detected adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The Diazyme NAbs assay strongly correlates with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in vaccinated individuals. Understanding the reactivity of commercially available serology platforms is important when distinguishing vaccination response versus natural infection.

SummaryThe Roche S (spike protein)-antibody and Diazyme neutralizing-antibodies (NAbs) assays were evaluated for their clinical utility in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 related adaptive immune responses by testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed patients, SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated individuals, and SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. Commercial serology results were compared to results generated using a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) NAbs assay and previously validated SARS-CoV-2 commercial serology assays (Roche N (nucleocapsid protein) antibody and Diazyme IgG). We demonstrate that the Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays detected adaptive immune response in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 PSV NAbs. The Roche S-antibody assay had an observed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100% for individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. By contrast, the Roche N assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect vaccine adaptive immune responses. Our findings also indicate that the Diazyme NAbs assay correlates strongly with the levels of SARS-CoV-2 ID50 neutralization titers using the PSV Nab assay in vaccinated individuals.",Raymond T Suhandynata; Nicholas J Bevins; Jenny T Tran; Deli Huang; Melissa A Hoffman; Kyle Lund; Michael J Kelner; Ronald W McLawhon; Steven L Gonias; David Nemazee; Robert L Fitzgerald,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253299,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253299,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
419,A tale of three SARS-CoV-2 variants with independently acquired P681H mutations in New York State,"Several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have independently acquired some of the same Spike protein mutations - notably E484K, N501Y, S477N, and K417T - associated with increased viral transmission and/or reduced sensitivity to neutralization by antibodies. Repeated evolution of the same mutations, particularly in variants that are now rapidly spreading in various regions of the world, suggests a fitness advantage. Mutations at position P681 in Spike - possibly affecting viral transmission - have also evolved multiple times, including in two variants of concern. Here, we describe three variants circulating in New York State that have independently acquired a P681H mutation and the different trajectories they have taken. While one variant rose to high prevalence since later summer 2020 it appears to be in decline. The other two variants were more recently detected in New York and harbor additional Spike mutations that might be cause for continued monitoring. The latter two P681H variants have shown moderate increases in prevalence but ultimately all might be subject to the same fate as more competitive variants come to dominate the scene.",Erica Lasek-Nesselquist; Janice Pata; Erasmus Schneider; Kirsten St. George,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253285,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253285,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

We found that the intention to get vaccinated or intake of the COVID-19 vaccine were positively related to the perceptions of becoming infected, perceptions of the severity of the potential long-term effects, the vaccines efficacy, and the benefits of vaccination. Meanwhile, the intention to get the vaccine or vaccine intake were decreased by perceptions of the negative side-effects and the general impediments to vaccination.",Marta Malesza; Erich Wittmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253346,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253346,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
421,"Risk, clinical course and outcome of ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a multicenter cohort study","Background and purposeThe frequency of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 varies in the current literature, and risk factors are unknown. We assessed the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

MethodsWe included patients with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in 16 hospitals participating in the international CAPACITY-COVID registry between March 1st and August 1st, 2020. Patients were screened for the occurrence of acute ischemic stroke. We calculated the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke and compared risk factors, cardiovascular complications, and in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ischemic stroke.

ResultsWe included 2147 patients with COVID-19, of whom 586 (27.3%) needed treatment at an intensive care unit (ICU). Thirty-eight patients (1.8%) had an ischemic stroke. Patients with stroke were older, but did not differ in sex or cardiovascular risk factors. Median time between onset of COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of stroke was two weeks. The incidence of ischemic stroke was higher among patients who were treated at an ICU (16/586; 2.7% versus 22/1561; 1.4%; p=0.039). Pulmonary embolism was more common in patients with (8/38; 21.1%) than in those without stroke (160/2109; 7.6%; adjusted RR: 2.08; 95%CI:1.52-2.84). Twenty-seven patients with ischemic stroke (71.1%) died during admission or were functional dependent at discharge and in-hospital mortality. Patients with ischemic stroke were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted RR 1.56; 95%CI:1.13-2.15) than patients without stroke.

ConclusionsIn this multicenter cohort study, the cumulative incidence of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was approximately 2%, with a higher risk in patients treated at an ICU. The majority of stroke patients had a poor outcome.

422,Are vaccines safe in patients with Long COVID? A prospective observational study.,"IntroductionAlthough the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 is well established, there are no published studies on the impact on symptoms in patients with Long Covid. Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals.

MethodsPatients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression.

ResultsForty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache).

When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.

ConclusionsReceipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing.

423,Reducing the Cost of Rapid Antigen Tests through Swab Pooling and Extraction in a Device,"The COVID-19 pandemic places a significant stress on the viral testing capabilities of many countries. The value of rapid point-of-care (PoC) antigen tests is becoming increasingly clear, but implementing frequent large scale testing is costly. We have developed an inexpensive device for pooling swabs, extracting specimens, and detecting viral antigens with a commercial lateral flow assay detecting the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen. The holder of the device can be produced locally through 3D printing. The extraction and the elution can be performed with the entire set-up encapsulated in a transparent bag, minimizing the risk of infection for the operator. With 6 swabs holding approx. 0.1 mL specimen each and 0.35 mL extraction buffer, 43{+/-}6 % (n= 8) of the signal for an individual extraction of a positive control standard was obtained. Image analysis still showed a signal-to-noise ratio of [&ge;] 7 upon further eight-fold dilution. Our current total cost of materials is below $ 2 per tested person or 20% of our cost for an individual PoC test. These findings suggest that pooling can make frequent testing more affordable for schools, universities and other institutions, without decreasing sensitivity to an unacceptable level. Further validation of the method is required.",Tim Berking; Sabrina G Lorenz; Alexander Ulrich; Joachim Greiner; Clemens Richert,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21252969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21252969,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
424,Analysis of Accumulated SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion in North Carolina: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 Community Research Partnership is a population-based longitudinal syndromic and sero-surveillance study. The study includes over 17,000 participants from six healthcare systems in North Carolina who submitted over 49,000 serology results. The purpose of this study is to use these serology data to estimate the cumulative proportion of the North Carolina population that has either been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or developed a measurable humoral response to vaccination.

MethodsAdult community residents were invited to participate in the study between April 2020 and February 2021. Demographic information was collected and daily symptom screen was completed using a secure, HIPPA-compliant, online portal. A portion of participants were mailed kits containing a lateral flow assay to be used in-home to test for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. The cumulative proportion of participants who tested positive at least once during the study was calculated. A standard Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to illustrate the probability of seroconversion over time up to December 20, 2020 (before vaccines available). A separate analysis was performed to describe the influence of vaccines during an extended period through February 15, 2021.

Results17,688 participants contributed at least one serology result. Approximately two-thirds of the population were female and almost three-quarters were between 30 and 64 years of age. The average number of serology test results submitted per participant was 3.0 ({+/-}1.9). At December 20, 2020, the overall probability of seropositivity in the CCRP population was 32.6%. At February 15, 2021 the probability among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers was 83% and 49%, respectively. An inflection upward in the probability of seropositivity was demonstrated around the end of December, suggesting an influence of vaccinations, especially for healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers, those in the oldest age category (60+ years) were 38% less likely to have seroconverted by February 15, 2021.

ConclusionsResults of this study suggest more North Carolina residents may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the number of documented cases as determined by positive RNA or antigen tests. The influence of vaccinations on seropositivity among North Carolina residents is also demonstrated. Additional research is needed to fully characterize the impact of seropositivity on immunity and the ultimate course of the pandemic.",John C Williamson; Thomas F Wierzba; Michele Santacatterina; Iqra Munawar; Austin L Seals; Christine Ann Pittman Ballard; Martha Alexander-Miller; Michael S Runyon; Lewis H McCurdy; Michael A Gibbs; Amina Ahmed; William H Lagarde; Patrick D Maguire; Robin King-Thiele; Terri Hamrick; Abdalla Ihmeidan; Shakira Henderson; Diane Uschner; David M Herrington; John W Sanders,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253226,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253226,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
425,Optimal vaccination strategies for COVID-19 based on dynamical social networks with real-time updating,"Vaccination strategy is crucial in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the supply is limited, contact network-based interventions can be most powerful to set an optimal strategy by identifying high-risk individuals or communities. However, due to the high dimension, only partial and noisy network information can be available in practice, especially for dynamical systems where the contact networks are highly time-variant. Furthermore, numerous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 impact considerably the current infectious probability, requiring real-time network updating algorithms. In this study, we propose a sequential network updating approach based on data assimilation techniques to combine different sources of temporal information. We then prioritise the individuals with high-degree or high-centrality, obtained from the assimilated networks, for vaccination. The assimilation-based approach is compared with the standard method (based on partially observed networks) and a random selection strategy in terms of vaccination effectiveness in a SIR model. The numerical comparison is first carried out using real-world face-to-face dynamical networks collected in a high school, following by sequential multi-layer networks, generated relying on the Barabasi-Albert model emulating the department of Computing at Imperial College London in the UK as an example.",Sibo Cheng; Rossella Arcucci; Christopher Pain; Yike Guo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253356,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253356,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
426,Efficient maternofetal transplacental transfer of anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies after antenatal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy and early infancy can result in severe disease. Evaluating the serologic response after maternal vaccination during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer has important implications for maternal care and vaccination strategies.

ObjectiveTo assess maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after antenatal mRNA vaccination.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study took place at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel in February 2021. Maternal and cord blood sera were collected for antibody measurement from mother/newborn dyads following antenatal vaccination.

ExposureSARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination.

Main outcome and measuresSpike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) - specific, IgG levels were evaluated in maternal and cord blood sera.

ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 20 parturients, with a median maternal age of 32 y ears and a median gestational age of 393/7 weeks at the time of delivery. The median time lapsed from the first and second doses of vaccine administration until delivery was 33 [IQR 30-37] and 11 [IQR 9-15] days, respectively. Of the 20 dyads, all women an d infants were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG levels in maternal sera were positively correlated to their respective concentrations in cord blood ({rho}s= 0.72; P<0.001 and {rho}s= 0.72; P <0.001, respectively). Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG titers in cord blood were directly correlated with time lapsed since the administration of the first vaccine dose ({rho}s= 0.71; P =0.001 and {rho}s= 0.63; P=0.004, respectively).

MethodsA chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) was offered to all participants in the first three rounds (Abbott; anti-nucleocapsid IgG). In the fourth round we offered this test and a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) (Beckman; anti-RBD IgG) to i) a randomly selected sub-cohort, ii) participants who were IgG-positive in any of the three first rounds; and iii) participants who were IgG-positive in the fourth round by point-of-care immunochromatography.

ResultsImmunoassays involving 10,153 participants (82.2% of people invited to donate samples) were performed in the fourth round. A total of 2595 participants (35.1% of participants with immunoassay results in the four rounds) were positive for anti-nucleocapsid IgG in at least one round. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG became undetectable in 43.3% of participants with positive first-round results. Pneumonia was more frequent in participants with anti-nucleocapsid IgG in all four rounds (11.2%) than those in which IgG became undetectable (2.4%).

In fourth round, anti-nucleocapsid and anti-RBD IgG were detected in 5.5% and 5.4% participants of the randomly selected sub-cohort, and in 26.6% and 25.9% participants with at least one previous positive result, respectively. Agreement between techniques was 90.3% (kappa: 0.72).

428,Characterizing the COVID-19 illness experience to inform the study of post-acute sequalae and recovery: a qualitative study,"We aimed to characterize the variability in the illness experience and recovery process from COVID-19. We conducted 24 in-depth individual interviews with participants enrolled in the Long-term Immunological Impact of Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort study in San Francisco, California from June through October of 2020. Participants were adults who had a previously confirmed positive SARV-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result, had recovered or were recovering from acute infection, and underwent serial evaluations at our clinical research center. We purposefully sampled 24 English- and Spanish-speaking adults with asymptomatic, mild and severe symptomatic infection, including those who were hospitalized, and those with HIV co-infection. Half of our sample (50.0%) identified as Latinx/Hispanic and most of the participants were men (62.5%). We used thematic analysis to characterize the illness experience, recovery process, and mental health impact of experiencing COVID-19 and present clinical data for each participant. Emergent themes were: (1) across symptom profiles and severity, experiencing COVID-19 was associated with psychological distress, (2) among participants with symptomatic infection, the illness experience was characterized by uncertainty in terms of managing symptoms and recovery, and (3) despite wide-ranging illness experiences, participants shared many common characteristics, including health information-seeking behavior facilitated by access to medical care, and uncertainty regarding the course of their illness and recovery.

429,Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients in outbreak on a cruise ship,"BackgroundA few studies on antibody testing have focused on asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with low initial anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-testing performance was evaluated using blood samples from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples were collected from 143 COVID-19 patients during an outbreak on a cruise ship 3 weeks after diagnosis. Simultaneously, a second SARS-CoV-2 genetic test was performed. Samples stored before the COVID-19 pandemic were also used to evaluate the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare false-negative- with positive-result samples.

ResultsSensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive values of LFA-detected IgM antibodies were 0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.613, respectively; those of LFA-detected IgG antibodies were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972, and 0.601, respectively; and those of ECLIA-detected total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.848, respectively. IgM-, IgG-, and total-antibody positivity rates in the patients with negative results from the second genetic testing were 22.9%, 47.6%, and 72.4%, respectively. All antibody titers, especially those of the IgG antibody against nucleocapsid protein, were significantly lower in blood samples with false-negative results than in those with positive results.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has lower performance in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients than required in the guidelines, and situations in which it is useful are limited.

With the elderly and front line workers first in line, the vaccination strategy for the general population remains unclear. In this study we identified 690,000 patients infected with COVID-19 with commercial health insurance coverage across the country between April 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020. From prior health care claims, we determined each persons pre-existing diseases among 26 common chronic diseases. Across age-sex strata we determined the relationships between these conditions and severe COVID-19 infections: ICU admission and extended in-patient stay. We classify disease according to risk, develop multivariable models to predict infection outcomes, and created an online risk assessment tool to estimate risk of ICU admission based on pre-existing health conditions.

432,An international comparison of age and sex dependency of COVID-19 Deaths in 2020 - a descriptive analysis,"COVID-19 mortality, the number of reported COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 persons observed so far, is described in 15 European countries and the USA depending on age groups and sex for the full year 2020. It is contrasted to the corresponding historic all-cause mortality per year depending on age and sex observed in these countries. Although there are substantial differences in the age and sex dependency of COVID-19 mortality between countries, there are some common features: Exponential increase with age is a good model to describe and analyse both COVID-19 and all-cause mortality above an age of 40 years, where almost all COVID-19 death occur. Age dependency is stronger for COVID-19 mortality than for all-cause mortality, males have an excess risk compared to women which flattens off with increasing age. Also with regard to calendar time, there were differences in the age and sex dependency between countries with the common tendency that male excess risk of COVID-19 mortality was smaller in the second half of the year.",Peter Bauer; Jonas Brugger; Franz Koenig; Martin Posch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253420,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253420,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
433,"Clinical presentation, disease course and outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with and without pre-existing cardiac disease: a cohort study across sixteen countries","AimsPatients with cardiac disease are considered high risk for poor outcomes following hospitalization with COVID-19. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate heterogeneity in associations between various heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality.

Method and resultsWe used data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry and LEOSS study. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between different types of pre-existent heart disease and in-hospital mortality. 10,481 patients with COVID-19 were included (22.4% aged 66 - 75 years; 38.7% female) of which 30.5% had a history of cardiac disease. Patients with heart disease were older, predominantly male and more likely to have other comorbid conditions when compared to those without. COVID-19 symptoms at presentation did not differ between these groups. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease (30.3%; n=968 versus 15.7%; n=1143). However, following multivariable adjustment this difference was not significant (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.06 [95% CI 0.98 - 1.15, p-value 0.13]). Associations with in-hospital mortality by heart disease subtypes differed considerably, with the strongest association for NYHA III/IV heart failure (aRR 1.43 [95% CI 1.22 - 1.68, p-value <0.001]) and atrial fibrillation (aRR 1.14 [95% CI 1.04 - 1.24, p-value 0.01]). None of the other heart disease subtypes, including ischemic heart disease, remained significant after multivariable adjustment.

ConclusionThere is considerable heterogeneity in the strength of association between heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality. Of all patients with heart disease, those with severe heart failure are at greatest risk of death when hospitalized with COVID-19.",Marijke Linschoten; Folkert W.

434,Day Camp in the Time of COVID-19: What Went Right?,"ObjectiveTo evaluate whether a successful camp experience can be achieved with implementation of COVID-19 education, screening and hygiene protocols, and designated cohorts during the summer of 2020.

Study DesignA survey study of summer day camp directors in the metro-New York area was conducted in September, 2020. The survey inquired about camper demographics, COVID-10 related policies, and the number of COVID-19 cases and exposures at each camp.

ResultsResponses were received from 77% (23/30) of camp directors at the completion of the 2020 summer. There were 8,480 camper children and 3,698 staff across the 23 camps surveyed. A variety of precautions were taken to limit COVID-19 incidence among campers and staff, most often including COVID-19 screening at entry, cohorting campers, maximizing outdoor activities, mandating mask use when indoors, and frequent hand sanitizing. Six staff and one camper tested positive for COVID-19. There was no secondary spread within the staff or campers in any of the camps.

ConclusionCamps successfully stayed open in the summer of 2020. The low level of COVID-19 in the community was critical to the initial success of camp opening.

435,Oxygen provision to severely ill COVID-19 patients at the peak of the 2020 pandemic in a Swedish district hospital: medical records-based cohort study,"Oxygen is a low-cost and life-saving therapy for patients with COVID-19. Yet, it is a limited resource in many hospitals in low income countries and in the 2020 pandemic even hospitals in richer countries reported oxygen shortages. An accurate understanding of oxygen requirements is needed for capacity planning. The World Health Organization estimates the average flow-rate of oxygen to severe COVID-19-patients to be 10 l/min. However, there is a lack of empirical data about the oxygen provision to patients. This study aimed to estimate the oxygen provision to COVID-19 patients with severe disease in a Swedish district hospital. A retrospective, medical records-based cohort study was conducted in March to May 2020 in a Swedish district hospital. All adult patients with severe COVID-19, those who received oxygen in the ward and had no ICU-admission during their hospital stay, were included. Data were collected on the oxygen flow-rates provided to the patients throughout their hospital stay, and summary measures of oxygen provision calculated. One-hundred and twenty six patients were included, median age was 70 years and 43% were female. On admission, 27% had a peripheral oxygen saturation of <=91% and 54% had a respiratory rate of >=25/min. The mean oxygen flow-rate to patients while receiving oxygen therapy was 3.0 l/min (SD 2.9) and the mean total volume of oxygen provided per patient admission was 16,000 l (SD 23,000). In conclusion, the provision of oxygen to severely ill COVID-19-patients was lower than previously estimated.

436,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cincinnati Ohio USA from August to December 2020,"The world is currently in a pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) caused by a novel positive-sense, single-stranded RNA {beta}-coronavirus referred to as SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately, most infected individuals recover and are then resistant to re-infection for a period, indicating that a vaccination approach can be successful. Elucidation of rates of past SARS-CoV-2 infection within select regions across the United States of America (USA) will help direct vaccination efforts and together will inform our approach towards achieving herd immunity. Here we investigated rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, USA metropolitan area from August to December 2020, just prior to initiation of the national vaccination program. Examination of 9,550 adult blood donor volunteers for serum IgG antibody positivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein showed an overall prevalence of 8.40%, measured as 7.56% in the first 58 days of this time frame, versus a significant increase to 9.24% in the last 58 days, and a final rate of 12.86% in December 2020. Approximately 56% of Spike seropositive individuals also had immunoreactivity against the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the Spike protein, which is associated with viral neutralization. Males and females in the Cincinnati area showed nearly identical rates of past infection, and rates among Hispanics, African Americans and Caucasians were not significantly different. Interestingly, donors under 30 years of age had the highest rates of past infection, while those over 60 had the lowest. Geographic analysis showed that the West side of Cincinnati had a rate of 9.63% versus 8.13% on the East side (demarcated by Interstate-75), while the adjoining area of Kentucky was 7.04% (as demarcated by the Ohio River). These results among healthy blood donors will be critical in calculating the time needed to achieve regional herd immunity in conjunction with the national vaccination campaign.",Greg Davis; Allen J York; Willis Clark Bacon; Suh-Chin Lin; Monica Malone McNeal; Alexander E Yarawsky; Joseph J Maciag; Jeanette L.C.

437,Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 and Mitigation Using Box Fan Air Cleaners in a Poorly Ventilated Classroom,"Many indoor places, including aged classrooms and offices, prisons, homeless shelters, etc., are poorly ventilated but resource-limited to afford expensive ventilation upgrade or commercial air purification systems, raising concerns on the safety of opening activities in these places in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation. Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space. The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient. However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards. In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone. The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain its efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient associated with human thermal plume and hot ventilation air during cold seasons. Overall, our study shows that box fan air cleaners can serve as an effective low-cost alternative for mitigating airborne transmission risks in poorly ventilated spaces.",Ruichen He; Wanjiao Liu; John Elson; Rainer Vogt; Clay Maranville; Jiarong Hong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253395,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253395,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
438,Acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among health care workers in Ghana,"The acceptance or otherwise of the COVID-19 vaccine by health care workers can influence the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among the general population as they are a reliable source of health information. In this study, we sought to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among health care workers in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected data from 234 health care workers through a self-administered online survey from 16 January to 15 February 2021. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses using binary logistic regression were performed using STATA version 15. The results showed that 39.3% of health care workers had the intention of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors such as sex, category of health care workers, relative being diagnosed with COVID-19, and trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government in the fight against COVID-19 proved to be significant predictors of the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns about the safety of vaccines and the adverse side effects of the vaccine were identified as the main reasons why health care workers would decline uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. The self-reported low intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana requires the urgent call of the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders to critically address health care workers concerns about the safety and adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as this would increase vaccine uptake.

439,COVID-19 and Medical Education in Ghana: Assessing the Impact,"Medical education in Ghana has been affected in many ways by the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the pandemic has affected both preclinical and clinical segments of medical education, the effect has been felt more at the clinical stage. Medical students on vacation who started their clinical training abroad could not return to their destination of study to complete their programme because of COVID-19 linked travel restrictions. This qualitative study examined how COVID-19 impacted on teaching and learning at a public higher education institution offering clinical medical education in Ghana for over 200 medical students. These medical students were from three different higher education institutions with varied curriculum outcomes. Thus, for them to be considered as a single group required innovativeness on the part of administrators. Open-ended interviews were held with administrators and the outcome indicated that salient aspects of the clinical training process had been impacted. These included administration of clinical education, curriculum, student learning, student assessment and code of practice. As a result of the pandemic, student learning shifted from traditional face to face interaction to online learning at the beginning. Some of the administrative challenges that ensued included the need for reduced number of students per tutor and introduction of afternoon sessions with a limited budget. The paper concludes that COVID-19 has been disruptive to traditional medical education in Ghana. However, the novel learning processes may provide opportunities to increase access to medical education using a phased system of learning. The findings from this study should have implications for policy and contribute to the discourse on blended learning in medical education in Ghana while ensuring that quality is maintained in all instances.",Edward Asumanu; Linda Tsevi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253306,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253306,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
440,Automated Production of Research Data Marts from a Canonical Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Data Repository: Applications to COVID-19 Research,"ObjectiveObjective: The COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the need for timely real-world data (RWD) for research. To meet this need, several large clinical consortia have developed networks for access to RWD from electronic health records (EHR), each with its own common data model (CDM) and custom pipeline for extraction, transformation, and load operations for production and incremental updating. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely RWD (e.g., 2-week delay) make this less feasible.

Methods and MaterialsWe describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical model for representation of clinical data for automated transformation to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs and the near automated production of linked clinical data repositories (CDRs) for COVID-19 research using the FHIR subscription standard. The approach was applied to healthcare data from a large academic institution and was evaluated using published quality assessment tools.

ResultsSix years of data (1.07M patients, 10.1M encounters, 137M laboratory results), were loaded into the FHIR CDR producing 3 linked real-time linked repositories: FHIR, PCORnet, and OMOP. PCORnet and OMOP databases were refined in subsequent post processing steps into production releases and met published quality standards. The approach greatly reduced CDM production efforts.

ConclusionsFHIR and FHIR CDRs can play an important role in enhancing the availability of RWD from EHR systems. The above approach leverages 21st Century Cures Act mandated standards and could greatly enhance the availability of datasets for research.",Leslie A Lenert; Adnrey V.

441,A rapid review of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization in the U.S.: alignment between Federal guidance and State practice,"BackgroundPopulation groups to be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. have been determined at the Federal level. Evidence suggests that there is variation in how States have implemented this guidance. This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice.

MethodsAn online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group.

ResultsHealthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Of the 37 States including frontline essential workers, 12 assigned them to a lower priority than recommended. Almost all States included the 65-74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by many States.

ConclusionsAcross the U.S, the prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable. Essential workers were the most often excluded or less highly prioritised group compared to Federal guidance. Some socially vulnerable groups were highly prioritized in State plans, whilst others were mentioned in only a few States. Future guidance must be relevant to local needs and values, to minimise any unwarranted heterogeneity in vaccine access across populations.",Vageesh Jain; Lara Schwarz; Paula Lorgelly,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253411,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
442,Immunodominant B cell epitope in SARS-CoV-2 RBD comprises a B.1.351 and P.1 mutation hotspot: implications for viral spread and antibody escape,"Recent SARS-CoV-2 variants pose important concerns due to their higher transmissibility (1) and escape (2) from previous infections or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (nAb). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein is a major nAb target (3), but data on its B cell epitopes are still lacking. Using a peptide microarray, we identified an immunodominant epitope (S415-429) recognized by 68% of sera from 71 convalescent Brazilians infected with the ancestral variant. In contrast with previous studies, we have identified a linear IgG and IgA antibody binding epitope within the RBD. IgG and IgA antibody levels for this epitope positively correlated with nAb titers, suggesting a potential target of antibody neutralizing activity. Interestingly, this immunodominant RBD region harbors the mutation hotspot site K417 present in P.1 (K417T) and B.1.351 (K417N) variants. In silico simulation analyses indicate impaired RBD binding to nAb in both variants and that a glycosylation in the B.1.351 417N could further hinder antibody binding as compared to the K417T mutation in P.1. This is in line with published data showing that nAb from either convalescents or anti-CoV-2 vaccinees are less effective towards B.1.351 than for P.1. Our data support the occurrence of immune pressure and selection involving this immunodominant epitope that may have critically contributed to the recent COVID-19 marked rise in Brazil and South Africa, and pinpoint a potential additional immune escape mechanism for SARS-CoV-2.",Keity Souza Santos; Jamille R Oliveira; Rafael RG Machado; Jhosiene Y Magawa; Isabela P Daher; Alysson H Urbanski; Gabriela JH Schmitz; Roberto Carlos V Silva Jr.; Edison L Durigon; Silvia B Boscardin; Daniela S Rosa; Deborah Schechtman; Helder I Nakaya; Edecio Cunha-Neto; Gabriele Gadermaier; Veronica Coelho; Jorge Kalil,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253399,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253399,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

Using a direct RT-PCR method with the Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene), the clinical sensitivity of the gargle was 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2 to 98.3%) and was similar to the sensitivity of the ONPS (93.8%; 95% CI, 88.2 to 97.3%), despite significantly lower viral RNA concentration in gargles, as reflected by higher cycle threshold values. No single specimen type detected all COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable in gargles at room temperature for at least 7 days.

444,Using translational in vitro-in vivo modeling to improve drug repurposing outcomes for inhaled COVID-19 therapeutics,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for antiviral treatments that can be deployed rapidly. Drug repurposing represents a promising means of achieving this objective, but repurposing efforts are often unsuccessful. A common hurdle to effective drug repurposing is a failure to achieve a sufficient therapeutic window in the new indication. A clear example is the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, where the approved dose (administered orally) fails to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lungs. Our proposed solution to the problem of ineffective drug repurposing for COVID-19 antivirals is two-fold: to broaden the therapeutic window by reformulating therapeutics for the pulmonary route, and to select drug repurposing candidates based on their model-predicted therapeutic index for inhalation. In this article, we propose a two-stage model-driven screening and validation process for selecting inhaled antiviral drug repurposing candidates. While we have applied this approach in the specific context of COVID-19, this in vitro-in vivo translational methodology is also broadly applicable to repurposing drugs for diseases of the lower respiratory tract.",Madison Stoddard; Lin Yuan; Arijit Chakravarty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253375,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253375,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

446,An observational cohort study on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and B.1.1.7 variant infection in healthcare workers by antibody and vaccination status,"BackgroundNatural and vaccine-induced immunity will play a key role in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 variants have the potential to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity.

MethodsIn a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing.

Results13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7.

ConclusionNatural infection resulting in detectable anti-spike antibodies and two vaccine doses both provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including against the B.1.1.7 variant.

447,Recovered not restored: Long-term health consequences after mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients,"BackgroundWhile the leading symptoms during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are acute and the majority of patients fully recover, a significant fraction of patients now increasingly experience long-term health consequences. However, most data available focus on health-related events after severe infection and hospitalization. We present a longitudinal, prospective analysis of health consequences in patients who initially presented with no or minor symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hence we focus on mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients.

MethodsWe included 958 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in this study. Patients were observed for seven months from April 6th to December 2nd 2020 for long-term symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We identified anosmia, ageusia, fatigue or shortness of breath as most common, persisting symptoms at month 4 and 7 and summarized presence of such long-term health consequences as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Predictors of long-term symptoms were assessed using an uni- and multivariable logistic regression model.

FindingsWe observed 442 and 353 patients over four and seven months after symptom onset, respectively. Four months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8.6% (38/442) of patients presented with shortness of breath, 12.4% (55/442) with anosmia, 11.1% (49/442) with ageusia and 9.7% (43/442) with fatigue. At least one of these characteristic symptoms was present in 27.8% (123/442) and 34.8% (123/353) at month 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. This corresponds to 12.8% patients with long-lasting symptoms relative to the initial total cohort (123/958). A lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk to develop long-term symptoms.

InterpretationThe on-going presence of either shortness of breath, anosmia, ageusia or fatigue as long-lasting symptoms even in non-hospitalized patients was observed at four and seven months post-infection and summarized as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). The continued assessment of patients with PCS will become a major task to define and mitigate the socioeconomic and medical long-term effects of COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSData about long-term health consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 is scarce and most available data describe health consequences in hospitalized patients during acute COVID-19. However, these studies do not take into account the vast majority of patients with a milder course of infection (WHO score1-3).

Added value of this studyOur cohort consists of mostly mild COVID-19 cases that have been prospectively followed for a median time of 6.8 months. At least one trained physician critically reviewed the patients reported symptoms at each visit. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG at each visit to correlate reported symptoms with serological data. At 4 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, shortness of breath occurred in 8.6% (38/442), anosmia in 12.4% (55/442), ageusia in 11.1% (49/442), and fatigue in 9.7% (43/442) of patients. At least one characteristic symptom was present in 27.8% (123/442) and 34.8% (123/353) at months 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. Symptoms were summarized as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Relative to our initial total cohort (123/958), this corresponds to 12.8% patients with long-lasting symptoms. Lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk of developing long-term symptoms.

Implications of all available evidenceWe believe that our findings have important implications for the fields of infectious diseases and public health, because we show long-term health consequences may occur even after very mild COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. As up to 81% of all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients present with mild disease, it can be expected that PCS will affect a larger number of individuals than initially assumed, posing major medical, social and economic challenges.",Max Augustin; Philipp Schommers; Melanie Stecher; Felix Dewald; Lutz Gieselmann; Henning Gruell; Carola Horn; Kanika Vanshylla; Veronica Di Cristianziano; Luise Osebold; Maria Roventa; Toqeer Riaz; Nikolai Tschernoster; Janine Altmueller; Leonard Rose; Susanne Salomon; Vanessa Priesner; Jan Christoffer Luers; Christian Albus; Stephan Rosenkranz; Birgit Gathof; Gerd Faetkenheuer; Michael Hallek; Florian Klein; Isabelle Suarez; Clara Lehmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253207,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253207,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
448,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection in Saliva by real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF Methods,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the need for rapid implementation of diagnostic assays for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens. While multiple molecular methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, supply chain constraints and need for easier and safer specimen collection warrant alternative specimen types, particularly saliva. Although saliva has been found to be a comparable clinical matrix for detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of diagnostic and analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we compared two methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva: the Roche cobas(R) 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test and the Agena Biosciences MassARRAY(R) SARS-CoV-2 Panel/MassARRAY(R) System. Overall, both systems had high agreement with one another, and both demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of each platform and determined the limit of detection of the Roche assay was four times lower than that of Agena for saliva specimens (390.6 v. 1,562.5 copies/mL). Furthermore, across individual target components of each assay, T2 and N2 targets had the lowest limits of detection for each platform, respectively. Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection in two technologies that have high agreement and differ in analytical sensitivities overall and across individual component targets. The addition of saliva as an acceptable specimen and understanding the sensitivity for testing on these platforms can further inform public health measures for screening and detection to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",Matthew M.

Methods20 medical professionals performed standard manual chest compression followed by leg-heel chest compression after a brief instruction on a manikin. We compared percentage of correct chest compression position, percentage of full chest recoil, percentage of correct compression depth, average compression depth, percentage of correct compression rate and average compression rate between both methods. In a second approach, potential aerosol spread during chest compression was visualized.

ResultsThere was no significant difference between manual and leg-heel compression. The distance to potential aerosol spread could have been increased by leg-heel method.

450,"Comparing COVID-19 risk factors in Brazil using machine learning: the importance of socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on Brazil. Brazils social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities and persisting political disarray. This complex scenario motivates careful study of the clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors contributing to increased risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil specifically.

MethodsWe consider the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe catalog, a very rich respiratory infection dataset which allows us to estimate the importance of several non-laboratorial and socio-geographic factors on COVID-19 mortality. We analyze the catalog using machine learning algorithms to account for likely complex interdependence between metrics.

FindingsThe XGBoost algorithm achieved excellent performance, producing an AUC-ROC of 0.813 (95%CI 0.810-0.817), and outperforming logistic regression. Using our model we found that, in Brazil, socioeconomic, geographical and structural factors are more important than individual comorbidities. Particularly important factors were: The state of residence and its development index; the distance to the hospital (especially for rural and less developed areas); the level of education; hospital funding model and strain. Ethnicity is also confirmed to be more important than comorbidities but less than the aforementioned factors.

InterpretationSocioeconomic and structural factors are as important as biological factors in determining the outcome of COVID-19. This has important consequences for policy making, especially on vaccination/non-pharmacological preventative measures, hospital management and healthcare network organization.

451,Mean Vitamin D levels in 19 European Countries & COVID-19 Mortality over 10 months,"ObjectivesReports early in the epidemic linking low mean national Vitamin D level with increased COVID-19 death, and until recently little research on the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on severity of COVID-19, led to this update of the initial report studying mortality up to the end of January 2021.

Methods, Design and SettingCoronavirus pandemic data for 19 European countries were downloaded from Our World in Data, which was last updated on January 24, 2021. Data from March 21, 2020 to January 22, 2021 were included in the statistical analysis. Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean data were collected by literature review. Poisson mixed-effect model was used to model the data.

ResultsEuropean countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID-19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean greater than 50, relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068 - 4.347, p-value = 0.032). A statistically significant negative moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean and the number of COVID-19 deaths for each 14-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic time period.

ConclusionsThe observation of the significantly lower COVID-19 mortality rates in countries with lowest annual sun exposure but highest mean Vitamin-D (25)-HD levels provides support for more awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy due to emergence of large number of COVID-19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these observations.

Strengths of this studyLarge number of different European populations studied with different policies of food fortification and different population Vitamin D levels

Ten months of longitudinal study during rise and fall and rise again of the epidemic

Limitations of this studyBased on population Vitamin D levels published before the beginning of the pandemic. Though there hasnt been a pan-European national/international health education initiative about Vitamin D and COVID-19 infection, it has been well covered in the media and could have resulted in changes, though probably minor, at the national level.

452,Quantifying Contact Patterns in Response to COVID-19 Public Health Measures in Canada,"BackgroundA variety of public health measures have been implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada to reduce contact between individuals.

ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to construct contact patterns to evaluate the degree to which social contacts rebounded to normal levels, as well as direct public health efforts toward age- and location-specific settings.

DesignFour population-based cross-sectional surveys.

SettingCanada.

ParticipantsMembers of a paid panel representative of Canadian adults by age, gender, official language, and region of residence.

MethodsRespondents provided information about the age and setting for each direct contact made in a 24-hour period. Contact matrices were constructed and contacts for those under the age of 18 years imputed. The next generation matrix approach was used to estimate the reproduction number (Rt) for each survey. Respondents with children estimated the number of contacts their children made in school and extracurricular settings.

ResultsEstimated Rt values were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.69) for May, 0.48 (95% CI: 0.29-0.68) for July, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.63-1.52) for September, and 0.81 (0.47-1.17) for December. The highest proportion of reported contacts occurred within the home (51.3% in May), in  other locations (49.2% in July) and at work (66.3% and 65.4% in September and December). Respondents with children reported an average of 22.7 (95% CI: 21.1-24.3) (September) and 19.0 (95% CI 17.7-20.4) (December) contacts at school per day per child in attendance.

453,Comprehensive evaluation of the impact of sociodemographic inequalities on adverse outcomes and excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City has been sharp, as several social inequalities coexist with chronic comorbidities. Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of social, municipal, and individual factors on the COVID-19 pandemic in working-age population living in Mexico City. To this end, we used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System; furthermore, we used a multidimensional metric, the social lag index (DISLI), to evaluate its interaction with mean urban population density (MUPD) and its impact on COVID-19 rates. Influence DISLI and MUPD on the effect of vehicular mobility policies on COVID-19 rates were also tested. Finally, we assessed the influence of MUPD and DISLI on discrepancies of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality compared with death certificates from the General Civil Registry. We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically active sectors and who experienced increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The impact of social inequalities transcends individuals and has significant effects at a municipality level, with and interaction between DISLI and MUPD. Marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced an accentuated risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts across marginalized municipalities. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths and significant excess mortality associated with non-COVID-19 deaths closely related to MUPD/DISLI in an ambulatory setting, which could be a negative externality of hospital reconversion.

454,Dynamic versus Continuous Interventions: Optimizing Lockdown Policies for COVID-19,"In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while millions of people await the administration of a vaccine, social distancing remains the leading approach towards the effect commonly known as ""flattening the curve"" of infections. Over the last year, governmental administrations throughout the globe have implemented various lockdown policies in hopes of slowing down the transmission of the disease. However, the current lack of consensus on when and how these policies should be implemented reflects the need for further studies regarding these questions. In this paper, we tackle the issue of lockdown policy management, in particular in terms of lockdown placement (how often, when, and how long these periods should be), in order to minimize the peak of infections in a specific population. We introduce a novel combination of classic mathematical disease modelling using the equation-based SEIR model, and Evolutionary Strategies (ES) for optimizing the peak of infections. The method is evaluated using data collected in different countries, and a particular focus is placed on the study of the effect of specific model parameters on lockdown optimization, such as the transmission rate ({beta}), of which 4 alternative modelling functions have been proposed and analyzed. Our results indicate that this transmission rate parameter significantly influences the resulting optimal strategies. In particular, the presence of a gradual decay of the rate of transmission during lockdown leads to longer, more sparsely placed confinement periods while an abrupt, instantaneous drop in the amount of contacts per person favors shorter but more frequent lockdowns. Although these results are limited by the scope of action provided by the simplicity of the SEIR model, they suggest that the influence of the evolution of the rate of transmission along the disease should be assessed in further studies with alternative optimization strategies (agent-based) and models (SEIRSHUD).",Kaan Akinci; Javier Fdez; Elena Pena-Tapia; Olaf Witkowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253324,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253324,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
455,Analysis of severe outcomes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England using ICNARC Case Mix Programme and QResearch databases.,"BackgroundA new, more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in the UK. We estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in critical ill patients, and overall mortality associated with VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant. We also compare clinical outcomes between these variants   groups.

MethodsWe linked a large primary care (QResearch), the national critical care (ICNARC CMP) and the COVID-19 testing (PHE) database and extracted two cohorts. The first was used to explore the association between VOC B.1.1.7 and critical care admission and 28-day mortality. The second to determine the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with VOC B.1.1.7 compared to those without. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, region, other socio-demographics and comorbidities (asthma, COPD, type I and II, hypertension). We reported information on types and duration of organ supports for the two variants   groups.

FindingsThe first cohort included 198,420 patients. Of these, 80,494 had VOC B.1.1.7, 712 were critically ill and 630 died by 28 days. The second cohort included 3432 critically ill patients. Of these, 2019 had VOC B.1.1.7 and 822 died at the end of critical care. Using the first cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios for critical care admission and mortality to be 1.99 (95% CI: 1.59, 2.49) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.25-2.03) for VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant group, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in critical care, estimated using the second cohort, was 0.93 (95% CI 0.76-1.15) for patients with VOC B.1.1.7, compared to those without.

InterpretationVOC B.1.1.7 appears to be more severe. Patients with VOC B.1.1.7 are at increased risk of critical care admission and mortality compared with patients without. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appears independent of virus strain.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01, or lineage B.1.1.7, was detected in England in September 2020. The characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with VOC B.1.1.7 are not yet known. VOC B.1.1.7 has been associated with increased transmissibility. Early analyses have suggested infection with VOC B.1.1.7 may be associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with infection with other virus variants, but these analyses had either limited ability to adjust for key confounding variables or did not consider critical care admission. The effects of VOC B.1.1.7 on severe COVID-19 outcomes remain unclear.

Added value of this studyThis study found a 60% higher risk of 28-day mortality associated with infection with VOC B.1.1.7 in patients tested in the community in comparison with the original variant, when adjusted for key confounding variables. The risk of critical care admission for those with VOC B.1.1.7 is double the risk associated with the original variant. For patients receiving critical care, the infecting variant is not associated with the risk of mortality at the end of critical care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe higher mortality and rate of critical care admission associated with VOC B.1.1.7, combined with its known increased transmissibility, are likely to put health care systems under further stress.

All variants either retained or improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Brazil) spike variants showed reduced binding to neutralizing NTD and RBD antibodies, respectively, while the B.1.351 (SA) variant showed reduced binding to both NTD- and RBD-directed antibodies.

458,"Prediction of severe COVID-19 cases requiring a ventilator in Tokyo, Japan","BackgroundTo avoid exhaustion of medical resources by COVID-19, policy-makers must predict care needs, specifically the proportion of severe cases likely to need ventilator care.

ObjectiveThis study was designed to use a statistical model to elucidate dynamics of severe cases in Tokyo and to discuss the timing of effective policy activation.

MethodsThe study extended from April 27 through October 18, 2020 in Japans Tokyo Metropolitan area. Medical exhaustion was defined as use of more than half of the ventilator capacity available before the COVID-19 outbreak. We regressed the number of severe cases on the newly onset patients of more than 14 days prior. As earlier research indicated, the COVID-19 severity changed at the end of May. Therefore, we added dummy variables to reflect changing severity from June and its product with newly onset patients as the explanatory variable. Then we calculated the threshold using R(t): R(t)=0.99 for the number of patients 14 days prior was used as a threshold at which strong countermeasures should be activated to keep to avoid medical exhaustion.

ResultsThe critical number signaling medical exhaustion in Tokyo was defined as 655 cases. We selected 15, 30, 60 and 90 days prior as explanatory variables for explaining the number of severe cases. A coefficient of determination larger than 0.95 was inferred as indicating good fit. The threshold was estimated as more than 4500 cases for R(t)=1.1 and monotonically decreasing by R(t) to be 600 cases for R(t)=2.5.

Discussion and ConclusionResults showed that newly onset patients reported more than 14 days prior can explain the number of severe cases very well. We also confirmed the threshold number of patients 14 days prior by R(t) for which strong countermeasures should be activated to avoid medical exhaustion with R(t)=0.99.

459,Google Trends as a method to predict new COVID-19 cases,"In this paper, we develop a method that can detect and predict the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 at an early stage. With this method, we try to lay the empirical basis for the development of the model of digital monitoring and prediction of the occurrence of new cases of COVID-19 in Croatia, relying on the analytical tool Google Trends (GT).

ResultsIn Croatia search activities using GT for terms such as   PCR +Covid"", ""PCR + test"", and symptoms ""cough + corona"", ""pneumonia + corona""; ""muscle pain + corona"" correlate strongly with officially reported cases of the disease. Google Trends tools are suitable for predicting the emergence of new COVID-19 cases in Croatia, and that the data collected by this method correlate with official data.

The benefit of this method is reliable estimates that can enable public health officials to prepare and better respond to the possible return of a pandemic in certain parts of the country. If a region experiences an early, sharp increase in Covid-19-like-illness Google searches, it may be possible to focus additional resources on that region to identify the etiology of the outbreak, providing extra medical capacity or raising local media awareness as necessary.

Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with Covid-19 symptoms, this method can serve as an early alarm to predict the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 in the specific area in Croatia.",Tado Juric,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253452,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253452,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
460,Negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR or rapid antigen test result and the subsequent risk of being infectious: a mathematical simulation study,"BackgroundA considerable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Therefore, different polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or rapid antigen test (RAT)-based approaches are being discussed and applied to identify infectious cases that would have gone undetected (e.g., in nursing homes). In this article, we provide a framework to estimate the time-dependent risk of being infectious after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test and we simulate the number of expected cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested negative.

MethodsA Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate infections that occurred over a one-week period in populations with 1,000 individuals following a negative SARS-Cov-2 test. Parameters representing the application of PCR tests or RATs are utilized, and SARS-CoV-2 7-day incidences between 25 and 200 per 100,000 people are considered. Simulation results are compared to case numbers predicted via a mathematical equation.

ResultsThe simulations showed a linear increase in cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. The different false negative rates of PCR tests and RATs have a strong impact on the number of simulated cases. The simulated and the mathematically predicted case numbers were comparable. However, Monte Carlo simulations highlight that, due to random effects, infectious cases can exceed predicted case numbers even shortly after a test was conducted.

ConclusionsThe analysis demonstrates that the number of infectious cases in a population can be effectively reduced by the screening of asymptomatic individuals.

461,A simplified SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay,"COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the highly infectious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is engaging worldwide scientific research to find a timely and effective eradication strategy. Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemy, it is necessary to quantify the neutralizing antibodies induction by vaccination, since they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, have been minimized in term of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays. Further this assay can be easily adapted to different coronaviruses variants by simply modifying the pseudotyping vector.",Gaetano Donofrio; Valentina Franceschi; Francesca Macchi; Luca Russo; Anna Rocci; Valentina Marchica; Federica Costa; Nicola Giuliani; Carlo Ferrari; Gabriele Missale,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253435,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253435,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
462,Qualification of the UniBw protection concept in different rooms of the Obermenzinger high school,"Current research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne particles. These particles are generated when infected persons exhale and they spread throughout the room, resulting in a high concentration and thus a high risk of infection of non-infected persons. One way to reduce the concentration of particles is to filter them using mobile room air cleaners, which can be easily set up and reduce the concentration of viruses or keep them at a low level. Since many studies are conducted in generic rooms, the question of the cleaning performance of such room air cleaners in real rooms arises. In order to investigate this, measurements of the effectiveness were carried out in a total of 4 different rooms of the ""Obermenzinger Gymnasium"" (Obermenzinger high school) in Munich. It can be shown that good effects of the room air cleaners are achieved even under realistic conditions.

463,Prevalence of COVID-19 in Iran: Results of the first survey of the Iranian COVID-19 Serological Surveillance program,"BackgroundThis study aims to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population of Iran.

MethodsThe target population was all Iranian people aged six years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28,314 subjects from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias, and sampling design.

ResultsOf the 28,314 Iranians selected, 11,256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male, and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until August 20, 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 13.3%, 15.2%), which was equal to 11,958,346 (95% confidence interval: 11,211,011-12,746,776) individuals. The prevalence of infection was 14.6%, 13.8%, 16.6%, 11.7%, and 19.4% among men, women, urban population, rural population, and individuals [&ge;]60 years of age, respectively. Ardabil, Golestan, and Khuzestan provinces had the highest prevalence, and Alborz, Hormozgan, and Kerman provinces had the lowest.

464,Sars-CoV-2 attack rate in reception and accommodation centres for asylum seekers: systematic review of outbreak media reports in Germany,"ObjectivesDespite concerns about the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (Sars-CoV-2) in refugee camps, data on attack rates and effectiveness of containment measures are lacking. We aimed to (1) quantify the attack rate of Sars-CoV-2 during outbreaks in reception and accommodation centres in Germany, (2) assess differences in the attack rate based on containment measures, and (3) provide an overview of testing strategies, communication, conflicts, and protection measures for refugees with special needs.

MethodsSystematic web-based review of outbreak media reports (until June 2020) on confirmed Sars-CoV-2 cases in reception centers for asylum seekers in Germany using the google search engine. Reports were screened for pre-defined inclusion criteria and complemented by snowball searches. Data on facility name, location, confirmed cases, containment measures, communication, protection strategies, and conflicts was extracted for each outbreak and reporting date. Evidence synthesis: meta-analysis and negative binomial regression.

FindingsWe identified 337 media reports on 101 Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks in 99 reception and accommodation centers in Germany. The pooled Sars-CoV-2 attack rate was 13.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 9.8-16.7). Outbreak sites implementing mass quarantine (n=76) showed higher rates (15.7; 95% CI: 11.6 - 20.2) compared to sites using conventional strategies (6.6; 95%CI: 3.1 - 11.2), yielding a rate ratio of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.27-0.72) adjusted for testing strategies, type and size of accommodation. Conflicts occurred in at least 11.8% of all outbreaks. Few sites reported specific measures to protect refugees with special needs.

ConclusionMass quarantine is associated with higher attack rates, and appears to be a counter-productive containment measure in overcrowded camps. Although further research with individual-level data is required to rule out residual confounding, reception centers and refugee camps should follow the available guidelines on Covid-19 response and refrain from mass quarantine if physical distancing cannot be guaranteed.",Rosa Jahn; Maren Hintermeier; Kayvan Bozorgmehr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21249641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21249641,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
465,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among undergraduate medical students: results from a nationwide survey in India,"COVID-19 vaccine was launched in India on 16 January 2021, prioritizing health care workers which included medical students. We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among undergraduate medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February - 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, hurried testing of vaccines prior to launch and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Risk perception regarding contracting COVID-19 vaccine reduced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitation in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers. Prior adult vaccination didnt have an effect upon COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted awareness campaigns, regulatory oversight of vaccine trials and public release of safety and efficacy data and trust building activities could further reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students.",Jyoti Jain; Suman Saurabh; Akhil Dhanesh Goel; Manoj Kumar Gupta; Pankaj Bhardwaj; Pankaja Ravi Raghav,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253444,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253444,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
466,"Modelling, prediction and design of national COVID-19 lockdowns by stringency and duration","The implementation of lockdowns has been a key policy to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to keep under control the number of infections. However, quantitatively predicting in advance the effects of lockdowns based on their stringency and duration is a complex task, in turn making it difficult for governments to design effective strategies to stop the disease. Leveraging a novel mathematical ""hybrid"" approach, we propose a new epidemic model that is able to predict the future number of active cases and deaths when lockdowns with different stringency levels or durations are enforced. The key observation is that lockdown-induced modifications of social habits may not be captured by traditional mean-field compartmental models because these models assume uniformity of social interactions among the population, which fails during lockdown. Our model is able to capture the abrupt social habit changes caused by lockdowns. The results are validated on the data of Israel and Germany by predicting past lockdowns and providing predictions in alternative lockdown scenarios (different stringency and duration). The findings show that our model can effectively support the design of lockdown strategies by stringency and duration, and quantitatively forecast the course of the epidemic during lockdown.",Alberto Mellone; Zilong Gong; Giordano Scarciotti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253454,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
467,SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase: a retrospective cohort study,"ObjectiveClinical sequelae have not been well characterized during the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 among adults 18 to 65 years old, and this study sought to fill that gap by evaluating excess risk and relative hazards for developing incident clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase.

DesignRetrospective cohort study including three propensity-matched groups.

SettingThis study merged three data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient lab testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database.

ParticipantsIndividuals 18 to 65 years old with continuous health plan enrollment from January 2019 to date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Three comparator groups were identified and propensity-score matched to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, a historical 2019 comparator group and a historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness (vLRTI).

Main outcome measuresOver 50 clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase (index date + 21 days) were ascertained using ICD-10 codes. Excess risk due to SARS-CoV-2 during the 4 months following the acute phase of illness and hazard ratios with 95% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals were calculated.

ResultsThis study found 14% of adults [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had at least one new clinical sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. When considering risk for specific sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection during the post-acute phase, clinical outcomes including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue were significantly elevated compared to the three propensity-matched comparator groups (2020, 2019, vLRTI). Significant risk differences due to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 when compared to the 2020 comparator group.

ConclusionsOur results confirm excess risk for developing clinical sequelae due to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen among other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults ([&le;]50 years), adults who did not have pre-existing conditions or adults who were not hospitalized due to COVID-19 were still at elevated risk for developing new clinical sequelae. The elevated risk for incident sequelae during the post-acute phase is relevant for healthcare planning.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSmall observational studies and case reports of hospitalized patients have shown some COVID-19 survivors suffer from short- and long-term sequelae. Few studies have characterized the excess risk of clinical sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase among adults [&le;]65 years of age in a large generalizable sample.

What this study addsThis study found 14% of individuals [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had a diagnosis of at least one new sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. Elevated risk for specific clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase of illness was noted across a range of organ systems including cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, respiratory, and mental health complications. The risk for incident sequelae increases with age, pre-existing conditions, and hospitalization for COVID-19; however, even among adults [&le;] 50 years of age and individuals without pre-existing conditions or hospitalization due to COVID-19, risk for some clinical sequelae is still elevated.

468,Impact of Vaccine Prioritization Strategies on Mitigating COVID-19: An Agent-Based Simulation Study using an Urban Region in the United States,"BackgroundApproval of novel vaccines for COVID-19 has brought hope and expectations, but not without additional challenges. One central challenge is how to appropriately prioritize the use of limited supply of vaccines. This study evaluates various prioritization strategies and the efficacy of the vaccination campaign underway in the U.S.

MethodsThe study develops a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under various social interventions including full and partial closures, isolation and quarantine, use of face mask and contact tracing, and vaccination. The model is populated with demographic and societal data for an urban community in the U.S. with 2.8 million residents as well as viral parameters. The model tracks daily numbers of infected, hospitalized, and deaths for all census age-groups. Model is calibrated using parameters for viral transmission and level of community circulation of individuals. Published data from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard is used to validate the model. Vaccination strategies are compared using hypothesis test for pairwise comparisons.

ResultsThree prioritization strategies examined are: a close variant of the CDC recommendation, an age-stratified strategy, and a random strategy. The impact of vaccination is also contrasted with a no vaccination scenario. The comparison shows that the ongoing campaign in the U.S. using vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is expected to 1) reduce the cumulative number of infection by 10% and 2) help the pandemic to subside below a small threshold of 100 daily new reported cases sooner by approximately a month. The prioritization strategies when compared with each other showed no significant difference in their impacts on pandemic mitigation.

ConclusionsRecent explosive growth of the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to shrink the susceptible population. This, we believe, will likely limit the expected number of people that could be prevented from getting infected due to vaccination. A shrinking susceptible pool may also be an attributable reason for the observed lack of statistical difference among the outcomes of the prioritization strategies. However, the invariance of the strategies should give more latitude for decision makers in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.",Hanisha Anand Tatapudi; Rachita Das; Tapas K Das,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253447,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

Using structure-guided chimeric spike designs and multiplexed immunizations, we demonstrate protection against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and bat CoV (BtCoV) RsSHC014 challenge in highly vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike mRNAs containing N-terminal domain (NTD), and receptor binding domains (RBD) induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against three high-risk sarbecoviruses: SARS-CoV, RsSHC014, and WIV-1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a 10 to >500-fold reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous sarbecovirus strains, but SARS-CoV challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infection including measurable lung pathology. Importantly, chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized both the D614G and the South African B.1.351 variants of concern despite some reduction in neutralization activity. Thus, multiplexed-chimeric spikes may provide a novel strategy to prevent pandemic and SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections, while revealing the limited efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccines against other sarbecoviruses.",David R.

472,An Innovative antibody-based Plug-and-Play strategy for SARS-CoV-2,"The novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) remains a public health threat worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 enters human host lung cells via its spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a process critical dependent on host protease-mediated fusion event. Thus, effective targeted therapies blocking the first step of viral fusion and cellular entry remains a critical unmet medical need to overcome disease pathology. Here we engineered and describe an antibody-based novel and targeted plug-and-play strategy, which directly competes with the proteolytic activation function of SAR-CoV-2 spike protein. The described strategy involves the engineering of furin substrate residues in IgG1 Fc-extended flexible region of spike targeting antibody. Our results with spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeting CR3022 antibody support blockade of the viral function using proof of concept ACE2 overexpressing cells.

The 2-O methylation of the first nucleotide converts the status of mRNA cap from Cap-0 to Cap-1, and thus, helps the virus evade immune surveillance in the host cell. Here, we report two structures of nsp16/nsp10 representing pre- and post-release states of the RNA product (Cap-1). We observe overall widening of the enzyme upon product formation, and an inward twisting motion in the substrate binding region upon product release. These conformational changes reset the enzyme for the next round of catalysis. The structures also identify a unique binding mode and the importance of a divalent metal ion for 2-O methylation.

474,Spike vs nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection: application in nasopharyngeal swab specimens,"Public health experts emphasize the need for quick, point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection as an effective strategy for controlling virus spread. To this end, many ""antigen"" detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2s nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprised of four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spikes S1 subunit. The assays performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike-assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct<25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct<25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being out-performed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results.

476,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are detectable in saliva,"Vaccines are critical for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within [~]1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5).

477,SARS-CoV-2 comprehensive receptor profiling: mechanistic insight to drive new therapeutic strategies,"Here we describe a hypothesis free approach to screen for interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with human cell surface receptors. We used a library screening approach to detect binding interactions across one of the largest known panels of membrane-bound and soluble receptors, comprising 5845 targets, expressed recombinantly in human cells. We were able confirm and replicate SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 and other putative coreceptors such as CD209 and CLEC4M. More significantly, we identified interactions with a number of novel SARS-CoV-2 S binding proteins. Three of these novel receptors, NID1, CNTN1 and APOA4 were specific to SARS-CoV-2, and not SARS-COV, with APOA4 binding the S-protein with equal affinity as ACE2. With this knowledge we may further understand the disease pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients and how infection by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to differences in pathology in specific organs or indeed the virulence observed in different ethnicities. Importantly we illustrate a methodology which can be used for rapid, unbiassed identification of cell surface receptors, to support drug screening and drug repurposing approaches for this and future pandemics.",Sarah MV Brockbank; Raquel Faba-Rodriguez; Lyn Rosenbrier Ribeiro; Catherine Geh; Helen Thomas; Jenni Delight; Lucy Coverley; W Mark Abbott; Jo Soden; Jim Freeth,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434937,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434937,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
478,Novel inhibition mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 main protease by ebselen and its derivatives,"The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has triggered numerous efforts to develop therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), which is a critical enzyme for transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2, is a key target for therapeutic development against COVID-19. An organoselenium drug called ebselen has recently been demonstrated to have strong inhibition against Mpro and antiviral activity but its molecular mode of action is unknown preventing further development. We have examined the binding modes of ebselen and its derivative in Mpro via high resolution co-crystallography and investigated their chemical reactivity via mass spectrometry. Stronger Mpro inhibition than ebselen and potent ability to rescue infected cells were observed for a number of ebselen derivatives. A free selenium atom bound with cysteine 145 of Mpro catalytic dyad has been revealed by crystallographic studies of Mpro with ebselen and MR6-31-2 suggesting hydrolysis of the enzyme bound organoselenium covalent adduct, formation of a phenolic by-product is confirmed by mass spectrometry. The target engagement of these compounds with an unprecedented mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition suggests wider therapeutic applications of organo-selenium compounds in SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic beta-corona viruses.",Kangsa Amporndanai; Xiaoli Meng; Haitao Yang; Zhie-Jie Liu; Leike Zhang; Yao Zhao; Samar Hasnain; Zihe Rao; Zhenming Jin; Weijuan Shang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434764,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434764,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
479,Determining the risk of developing symptomatic covid-19 infection after attending hospital for radiological examinations: controlled cohort study,"OBJECTIVETo determine whether brief attendance for outpatient radiological investigations is associated with increased risk of clinically significant coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection.

DESIGNObservational cohort study with a historical control.

SETTING2 large UK University Hospitals located in Nottingham and Cardiff.

PARTICIPANTSAll 47,340 patients who attended an outpatient radiology appointment at Nottingham University Hospitals and University Hospital of Wales during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, and 70,655 patients that comprised the control cohort who attended for outpatient radiology the same period in 2019.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe risk of developing clinically significant covid-19 infection within 28-days of attending a radiological examination. Covid-19 infection rates for the 2020 cohort were compared against a control group who attended in 2019.

RESULTS84 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were temporally associated with 47,340 radiological examinations across two hospitals in 2020. This low infection rate was higher than the 2019 control cohort; OR 2.507 (1.766 - 3.559) and equates to an approximate 1 positive covid-19 infection per 1000 radiology investigations.

CONCLUSIONSOur data suggests that attending hospitals for outpatient radiological investigations during the pandemic is associated with a very small absolute risk of acquiring clinically significant covid-19 infection. It is unlikely that this risk is directly attributable to radiology attendance, considering the reasons leading individuals to attend hospitals during the pandemic, the true attributable risk will likely be even lower.

Our preliminary findings point towards an association between higher case rates and deprivation with implications for health inequalities. Furthermore, we also observed an association between higher case rates and lower rates of vaccination.

481,Tiled-ClickSeq for targeted sequencing of complete coronavirus genomes with simultaneous capture of RNA recombination and minority variants,"High-throughput genomics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to characterize virus evolution and to identify adaptations that affect pathogenicity or transmission. While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called  Tiled-ClickSeq. Tiled-ClickSeq uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, obviating the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction using Illumina adaptors generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5UTR, at high depth and specificity to virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.",Andrew Laurence Routh; Elizabeth Jaworski; Rose M Langsjoen; Barbara Judy; Patrick Newman; Yiyang Zhou; Daniele Swetnam; Aaron L Miller; Jessica A Plante; Kenneth S Plante; Jianli Dong; Ping Ren; Thomas Ksiazek; Vineet D Menachery; Scott Weaver,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434828,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434828,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
482,Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies causal links between blood proteins and severe COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic death toll now surpasses two million individuals and there is a need for early identification of individuals at increased risk of mortality. Host genetic variation partially drives the immune and biochemical responses to COVID-19 that lead to risk of mortality. We identify and prioritise blood proteins and biomarkers that may indicate increased risk for severe COVID-19, via a proteome Mendelian randomization approach by collecting genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for >4,000 blood proteins. After multiple testing correction, troponin I3, cardiac type (TNNI3) had the strongest effect (odds ratio (O.R.) of 6.86 per standard deviation increase in protein level), with proteinase 3 (PRTN3) (O.R.=2.48), major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 2 (HLA-DQA2) (O.R.=2.29), the C4A-C4B heterodimer (O.R.=1.76) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1 (LRPAP1) (O.R.=1.73) also being associated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. Conversely, major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MHC1A) (O.R.=0.6) and natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3 (NCR3) (O.R.=0.46) were associated with lower odds. These proteins are involved in heart muscle contraction, natural killer and antigen presenting cells, and the major histocompatibility complex.

483,Functional Antibodies in COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma,"In the absence of an effective vaccine or monoclonal therapeutic, transfer of convalescent plasma (CCP) was proposed early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as an easily accessible therapy. However, despite the global excitement around this historically valuable therapeutic approach, results from CCP trials have been mixed and highly debated. Unlike other therapeutic interventions, CCP represents a heterogeneous drug. Each CCP unit is unique and collected from an individual recovered COVID-19 patient, making the interpretation of therapeutic benefit more complicated. While the prevailing view in the field would suggest that it is administration of neutralizing antibodies via CCP that centrally provides therapeutic benefit to newly infected COVID-19 patients, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients already possess neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of antibodies can extend far beyond their simple ability to bind and block infection, especially related to their ability to interact with the innate immune system. In our work we deeply profiled the SARS-CoV-2-specific Fc-response in CCP donors, along with the recipients prior to and after CCP transfer, revealing striking SARS-CoV-2 specific Fc-heterogeneity across CCP units and their recipients. However, CCP units possessed more functional antibodies than acute COVID-19 patients, that shaped the evolution of COVID-19 patient humoral profiles via distinct immunomodulatory effects that varied by pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG titers in the patients. Our analysis identified surprising influence of both S and Nucleocapsid (N) specific antibody functions not only in direct antiviral activity but also in anti-inflammatory effects. These findings offer insights for more comprehensive interpretation of correlates of immunity in ongoing large scale CCP trials and for the design of next generation therapeutic design.",Jonathan D Herman; Chuangqi Wang; Carolin Loos; Hyun ah Yoon; Johanna Rivera; M.

484,Point-of-care ultrasonography for risk stratification of non-critical suspected COVID-19 patients on admission (POCUSCO): a prospective binational study,"BackgroundLung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is highly effective in detecting pulmonary peripheral patterns and may allow early identification of patients who are likely to develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that L-POCUS performed during the initial examination would identify non-severe COVID-19 patients with a high risk of getting worse.

MethodsPOCUSCO was a prospective, multicenter study. Non-critical adult patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included and had L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following admission. The severity of lung damage was assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. The primary outcome was the rate of patients requiring intubation or who died within 14 days following inclusion.

ResultsAmong 296 participating patients, 8 (2.7%) had primary outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic of L-POCUS was 0.80 [95%CI:0.60-0.94]. The score values which achieved a sensibility > 95% in defining low-risk patients and a specificity > 95% in defining high-risk patients were <1 and [&ge;]16, respectively. The rate of patients with an unfavorable outcome was 0/95 (0%[95%CI:0-3.9]) for low-risk patients (score=0) versus 4/184 (2.17%[95%CI:0.8-5.5]) for intermediate-risk patients (score 1-15) and 4/17 (23.5%[95%CI:11.4-42.4]) for high-risk patients (score [&ge;]16). In patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n=58), the AUC of L-POCUS was 0.97 [95%CI:0.92-1.00].

ConclusionsL-POCUS allows risk-stratification of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. These results should be confirmed in a population with a higher risk of an unfavorable outcome.

485,Exploring the short-term role of particulate matter in the COVID-19 outbreak in USA cities,"The role of particulate matter (PM) in the COVID-19 pandemic is currently being discussed by the scientific community. Long-term (years) exposure to PM is known to affect human health by increasing susceptibility to viral infections as well as to the development of respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. In the short-term (days to months), PM has been suggested to assist airborne viral transmission. However, confounding factors such as urban mobility prevent causal conclusions. In this study, we explore short-term relationships between PM concentrations and the evolution of COVID-19 cases in a number of cities in the United States of America. We focus on the role of PM in facilitating viral transmission in early stages of the pandemic. We analyzed PM concentrations in two particle size ranges, < 2.5 {micro}m, and between 10 and 2.5 {micro}m (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Granger causality analysis was employed to identify instantaneous and lagged effects of pollution in peaks of COVID-19 new daily cases in each location. The effect of pollution in shaping the disease spread was evaluated by correlating the logistic growth rate of accumulated cases with pollutants concentrations for a range of time lags and accumulation windows. PM2.5 shows the most significant results in Granger causality tests in comparison with the other pollutants. We found a strong and significant association between PM2.5 concentrations and the growth rate of accumulated cases between the 1st and 18th days after the report of the infection, peaking at the 8th day. By comparing results of PM2.5 with PM10, CO and NO2 we rule out confounding effects associated with mobility. We conclude that PM2.5 is not a first order effect in the cities considered; however, it plays a significant role in facilitating the COVID-19 transmission. We estimate that the growth rate of COVID-19 cases would be risen by 12.5% if PM2.5 is increased from 25 to 35 {micro}g m-3.",Leonardo Yoshiaki Kamigauti; Gabriel Martins Palma Perez; Carlos Eduardo Souto-Oliveira; Elizabeth Cowdery; Paulo Hilario Nascimento Saldiva; Maria de Fatima Andrade,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253212,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253212,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
486,High-resolution epigenome analysis in nasal samples derived from children with respiratory viral infections reveals striking changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundDNA methylation patterns of the human genome can be modified by environmental stimuli and provide dense information on gene regulatory circuitries. We studied genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal samples from infants (<6 months) applying whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize epigenome response to 10 different respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsWe identified virus-specific differentially methylated regions (vDMR) with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2 followed by Influenza B (Flu B) causing the weakest vs. strongest epigenome response with 496 vs. 78541 and 14361 vDMR, respectively. We found a strong replication rate of FluB (52%) and SARS-CoV-2 (42%) vDMR in independent samples indicating robust epigenome perturbation upon infection. Among the FluB and SARS-CoV-2 vDMRs, around 70% were hypomethylated and significantly enriched among epithelial cell-specific regulatory elements whereas the hypermethylated vDMRs for these viruses mapped more frequently to immune cell regulatory elements, especially those of the myeloid lineage. The hypermethylated vDMRs were also enriched among genes and genetic loci in monocyte activation pathways and monocyte count. Finally, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing characterization of nasal mucosa in response to these two viruses to functionally analyze the epigenome perturbations. Which supports the trends we identified in methylation data and highlights and important role for monocytes.

ConclusionsAll together, we find evidence indicating genetic predisposition to innate immune response upon a respiratory viral infection.

487,Predicting the Efficacy of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donor Units with the Lumit Dx anti-Receptor Binding Domain Assay.,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 that causes COVID-19 has resulted in the death of more than 2.5 million people, but no cure exists. Although passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable therapeutic option, the selection of optimal units for therapy in a timely fashion remains a barrier.

Study design and methodsSince virus neutralization is a necessary characteristic of plasma that can benefit recipients, the neutralizing titers of plasma samples were measured using a retroviral-pseudotype assay. Binding antibody titers to the spike (S) protein were also determined by a clinically available serological assay (Ortho-Vitros total IG), and an in-house ELISA. The results of these assays were compared to a measurement of antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 S protein (Promega Lumit Dx).

ResultsAll measures of antibodies were highly variable, but correlated, to different degrees, with each other. However, the anti-RBD antibodies correlated with viral neutralizing titers to a greater extent than the other antibody assays.

488,What level of neutralising antibody protects from COVID-19? .,"Both previous infection and vaccination have been shown to provide potent protection from COVID-19. However, there are concerns that waning immunity and viral variation may lead to a loss of protection over time. Predictive models of immune protection are urgently needed to identify immune correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we modelled the relationship between in vitro neutralisation levels and observed protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection using data from seven current vaccines as well as convalescent cohorts. Here we show that neutralisation level is highly predictive of immune protection. The 50% protective neutralisation level was estimated to be approximately 20% of the average convalescent level (95% CI = 14-28%). The estimated neutralisation level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level (CI = 0.7-13%, p = 0.0004). Given the relationship between in vitro neutralization titer and protection, we then used this to investigate how waning immunity and antigenic variation might affect vaccine efficacy. We found that the decay of neutralising titre in vaccinated subjects over the first 3-4 months after vaccination was at least as rapid as the decay observed in convalescent subjects. Modelling the decay of neutralisation titre over the first 250 days after immunisation predicts a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralisation titres against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared to the vaccine strain and our model predicts the relationship between neutralisation and efficacy against viral variants. Our analyses provide an evidence-based prediction of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.",David S Khoury; Deborah Cromer; Arnold Reynaldi; Timothy E Schlub; Adam K Wheatley; Jennifer A Juno; Kanta Subbarao; Stephen J Kent; James A Triccas; Miles P Davenport,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252641,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
489,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is extremely vivacious in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic calls for rapid actions, now principally oriented to a world-wide vaccination campaign.

In this study we verified if, in individuals with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single dose of mRNA vaccine would be immunologically equivalent to a full vaccine schedule in naive individuals.

MethodsHealth care workers (184) with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were sampled soon before the second dose of vaccine and between 7 and 10 days after the second dose, the last sampling time was applied to SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals, too.

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay.

The study was powered for non-inferiority. We used non parametric tests and Pearson correlation test to perform inferential analysis.

ResultsAfter a single vaccine injection, the median titer of specific antibodies in individuals with previous COVID-19 was 30,527 U/ml (IQR 19,992-39,288) and in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection was 19,367.5 U/ml (IQR 14,688-31,353) (P=0.032). Both results were far above the median titer in naive individuals after a full vaccination schedule: 1,974.5 U/ml (IQR 895-3,455) (P<0.0001). Adverse events after vaccine injection were more frequent after the second dose of vaccine (mean 0.95, 95%CI from 0.75 to 1.14 versus mean 1.91, 95%CI from 1.63 to 2.19)(P<0.0001) and in exposed compared to naive (mean 1.63; 95%CI from 1.28 to 1.98 versus mean 2.35; 95%CI from 1.87 to 2.82)(P=0.015).

490,"Bromodomain and Extraterminal Protein Inhibitor, Apabetalone (RVX-208), Reduces ACE2 Expression and Attenuates SARS-CoV-2 Infection in vitro","Effective therapeutics are urgently needed to counter infection and improve outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19 and to combat this pandemic. Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells. Moreover, we show that apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to antiviral agents. Taken together, our study supports further evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19, either alone or in combination with emerging therapeutics.

491,Low ozone concentration and negative ions for rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation,"Ozone is a powerful anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral agent, yet exposure to high levels of ozone can pose risks to human/animal health and, in the long term, corrode certain objects. In order to overcome these risks, we evaluated the potential of using a relatively short exposure of a low concentration of ozone to disinfect an indoor environment in the absence of individuals and animals. ICON3 by O3ZONO/M2L, a new disinfection device generating both ozone and negative ions, was selected to assess the potential of this strategy to inactivate different viral isolates of SARS-CoV-2.

Tests under controlled laboratory conditions were performed in a system consisting of an ozone-proof airtight plastic box inside a biological safety cabinet, where suspensions of two strains of SARS-CoV-2 were exposed to ozone and negative ions and virucidal activity was measured by means of two complementary methodologies: viral replication capacity and viral titer determination.

These studies revealed that low concentration ozone (average 3.18 ppm after the peak) inactivated up to >99% of SARS-CoV-2 within 20 minutes of exposure. Under controlled conditions, similar ozone exposure was recreated with ICON3 in different volume rooms (15, 30, 60 m3) where a linear relationship was observed between the room volume and the time of continuous ozone/ions flow required to reach and maintain the desired ozone levels used in the laboratory studies.

These studies suggest that ICON3 may have the potential for use in the disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments in the absence of individuals and animals, under properly controlled and monitored safety conditions.",Davide De Forni; Barbara Poddesu; Giulia Cugia; Giovanni Gallizia; Massimo La Licata; Julianna Lisziewicz; James G.

As rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of minor virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in nature or identified from preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies and in the clinic. This study demonstrates that a combination of noncompeting antibodies not only provides full coverage against currently circulating variants but also protects against emergence of new such variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical setting.",Richard Copin; Alina Baum; Elzbieta Wloga; Kristen E Pascal; Stephanie Giordano; Benjamin O Fulton; Anbo Zhou; Nicole Negron; Kathryn Lanza; Newton Chan; Angel Coppola; Joyce Chiu; Min Ni; Gurinder S Atwal; Annabel Romero Hernandez; Kei Saotome; Yi Zhou; Matthew C Franklin; Andrea T Hooper; Shane McCarthy; Sara Hamon; Jennifer D Hamilton; Hilary M Staples; Kendra Alfson; Ricardo Carrion Jr.; Shazia Ali; Thomas Norton; Selin Somersan-Karakaya; Sumathi Sivapalasingam; Gary A Herman; David M Weinreich; Leah Lipsich; Neil Stahl; Andrew J Murphy; George D Yancopoulos; Christos A Kyratsous,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434834,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434834,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
493,Phodopus roborovskii SH101 as a systemic infection model of SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide threat with its unusually high transmission rates and rapid evolution into diverse strains. Unlike typical respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes systemic infection by breaking the boundaries of the respiratory systems. The development of animal models recapitulating the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of utmost importance not only for the development of vaccines and antivirals but also for understanding the pathogenesis. However, there has not been developed an animal model for systemic infection of SARS-CoV-2 representing most aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with systemic symptoms. Here we report that a hamster strain of Phodopus roborovskii SH101, a laboratory inbred hamster strain of P. roborovskii, displayed most symptoms of systemic infection upon SARS-CoV-2 infection as in the case of the human counterpart, unlike current COVID-19 animal models. P. roborovskii SH101 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2 represented most clinical symptoms of COVID-19 such as snuffling, dyspnea, cough, labored breathing, hunched posture, progressive weight loss, and ruffled fur, in addition to high fever following shaking chills. Histological examinations also revealed a serious right-predominated pneumonia as well as slight organ damages in the brain and liver, manifesting systemic COVID-19 cases. Considering the merit of a small animal as well as its clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, this hamster model seems to provide an ideal tool to investigate COVID-19.

Author summaryAlthough the current animal models supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed varying degrees of illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infections of SARS-CoV-2 were mainly limited to the respiratory systems of these animals, including hACE2 transgenic mice, hamsters, ferrets, fruit bats, guinea pigs, African green monkey, Rhesus macaques, and Cynomolgus macaques. While these animal models can be a modest model for the respiratory infection, there is a clear limit for use them in the study of COVID-19 that also displays multiple systemic symptoms. Therefore, the development of an animal model recapitulating COVID-19-specific symptoms such as the right-predominated pneumonia would be the utmost need to overcome the imminent threat posed by COVID-19. We identified a very interesting hamster strain, Phodopus roborovskii SH101, which mimics almost all aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike the current animal models, SARS-CoV-2-infected P. roborovskii SH101 not only displayed the symptoms of respiratory infection but also clinical manifestations specific to human COVID-19 such as high fever following shaking chills, serious right-predominated pneumonia, and minor organ damages in the brain and liver.",Chongkai Zhai; Mingda Wang; Hea-Jong Chung; Md.

494,Emerging variants of concern in SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein: a highly conserved target with potential pathological and therapeutic implications,"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) gene are relatively uncommon. The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulfate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. The rapid emergence of this sub-B.1 clade with recurrent I82T mutation suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434758,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434758,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False

We previously showed protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease and pneumonia in hamsters vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Here, we observed a 9.5-fold reduction of virus neutralizing antibody titer in vaccinated hamster sera against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 did not lose weight compared to control animals. In contrast to control animals, the lungs of vaccinated animals did not show any gross lesions. Minimal to no viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and no infectious virus was detected in lungs of vaccinated animals. Histopathological evaluation showed extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 replication in the control animals, but none in the vaccinated animals.

496,Prediction of COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients in Sudan,"BackgroundCOVID-19 was primarily reported in China. The mortality rate across countries had ranged from 1% up to more than 10% and it is underestimated in some countries. Advanced age is the most frequently reported factor associated to mortality. Other factors were the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. Several models for mortality prediction had been developed to assist in improving the prognosis. The aim of our study was to assess the factors related to mortality among COVID-19 patients and develop a prediction model based on these factors.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study assessed the factors related to the mortality among COVID-19 patients who attended Imperial Hospital isolation centre on November-December, 2020, Khartoum, Sudan. Statistical tests performed were chi-square test, odds ratio and regression to develop the prediction model. Tests were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

Results105 patients were studied. 29% of the patients were deceased, while, 71% were discharged alive. A statistically significant association was found between the age and severity with regards to mortality rate (p=0.034, 0.018 respectively). The model equation for mortality prediction: Mortality = -14.724+ (1.387* Age) + (-0.323* Gender) + (1.814* Admission) + (0.193* Ischemic Heart Disease) + (-0.369* Fever) + (1.595* Cough) + (1.953* Complications) + (0.149* Duration of hospitalization) + (0.999* Enoxaparin dose).

ConclusionsAge, admission ward, cough and enoxaparin dose were statistically significant predictors for COVID-19 mortality (p= 0.014, 0.011, 0.015, 0.006 respectively).",Ghada Omer Hamad Abd El-Raheem; Maysoun Ahmed Awad Yousif; Doaa Salih Ibrahim Mohamed,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253179,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253179,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
497,Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to baseline antibody status in staff and residents of 100 Long Term Care Facilities (VIVALDI study),"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection represents a major challenge for Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) and many residents and staff are now sero-positive following persistent outbreaks. We investigated the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and subsequent infection in this population.

MethodsProspective cohort study of infection in staff and residents in 100 LTCFs in England between October 2020 and February 2021. Blood samples were collected at baseline (June 2020), 2 and 4 months and tested for IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken weekly in staff and monthly in residents. The primary analysis estimated the relative hazard of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, from Cox regression adjusted for age and gender, and stratified by LTCF.

FindingsStudy inclusion criteria were met by 682 residents and 1429 staff. Baseline IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 residents (33%) and 408 staff (29%). A total of 93 antibody-negative residents had a PCR-positive test (0.054 per month at risk) compared to 4 antibody-positive residents (0.007 per month at risk). There were 111 PCR-positive tests in antibody-negative staff (0.042 per month at risk) compared to 10 in antibody-positive staff (0.009 per month at risk). The adjusted hazard ratios for reinfection in staff and residents with a baseline positive versus negative antibody test were 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.40) and 0.39 ((95% CI: 0.19-0.77) respectively. Of 12 reinfected participants with data on symptoms, 11 were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases.

InterpretationThe presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid) and MedRxiv on 18 January 2021 for studies in LTCFs that described the risk of infection in individuals who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to individuals who were seronegative. Search terms were deliberately broad to improve capture of relevant literature and included ""SARS-CoV-2""OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""coronavirus"" AND ""care home"" OR ""nursing home"" OR ""long term care facility"" with no date or language restrictions. We did not identify any publications that focussed on risk of reinfection in seropositive individuals, but subsequent to our search one study has been published using data from two LTCFs in London, UK. This study reported a 96% reduction in the odds of reinfection in individuals who were seropositive compared to those who were seronegative based on 4-month follow-up in 161 participants. We found 10 studies that performed seroprevalence surveys in either staff or staff and residents in LTCFs in 8 cohorts. Five of these were carried out in response to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within the care homes, either as part of the subsequent investigation or as post-infection surveillance. The largest of these, which enrolled both staff and residents, was performed in 6 LTCFs and performed longitudinal antibody testing.

Added value of this studyWe undertook a cohort study in staff and residents from 100 LTCFs in England to investigate whether individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection could be infected twice. Staff and residents were offered up to three rounds of antibody testing and antibody results were linked to PCR test results which were obtained weekly from staff and monthly from residents through the national SARS-CoV-2 testing programme. This study, which was conducted in >2000 staff and residents, suggests that antibodies provide high levels of protection against reinfection for up to 10 months. Almost all cases of reinfection were symptomatic, but no cases required hospital treatment. Amongst those with detectable baseline antibodies, quantitative antibody titres against spike protein and nucleocapsid were comparable between cases of reinfection and those who did not become reinfected.

Implications of all available evidenceDespite high background rates of infection in LTCFs, the overall risk of reinfection was low in this population. This is broadly consistent with findings from large cohort studies of hospital staff, but, importantly, extends the evidence of substantial protection to frail elderly, who are vulnerable to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 due to age-related changes in immunity (immune-senescence) and high levels of comorbidity. The low risk of reinfection in our study suggests identification of immune correlates of protection in this population will require pooling of data across multiple cohorts.

As vaccination coverage in residents approaches 100% in England, it will be important to understand whether vaccination and natural infection provide comparable levels of protection against infection. Such insights will inform future policy decisions regarding re-vaccination schedules in LTCF, and the longer-term need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as asymptomatic testing and visitor restrictions.",Maria Krutikov; Tom Palmer; Gokhan Tut; Chris Fuller; Madhumita Shrotri; Haydn Williams; Daniel Davies; Aidan Irwin-Singer; James Robson; Andrew Hayward; Paul Moss; Andrew Copas; Laura J Shallcross,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253110,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253110,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,True
498,Detection of autoimmune antibodies in severe but not in moderate or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients,"The heterogeneity of COVID-19 lies within its diverse symptoms and severity, ranging from mild to lethal. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients, characterized by a hyper cytokine storm. Autoimmunity is proposed to occur as a result of COVID-19, given the high similarity of the immune responses observed in COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. Here, we investigate the level of autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients with different severities. Initial screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) IgG revealed that 1.6% (2/126) and 4% (5/126) of ICU COVID-19 cases developed strong and moderate ANA levels, respectively. However, all the non-ICU cases (n=273) were ANA negative. The high ANA level was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IFA) and large-scale autoantibody screening by phage immunoprecipitation-sequencing (PhIP-Seq). Indeed, the majority of the samples showed ""speckled"" ANA pattern by microscopy, and we demonstrate that samples of ICU patients with strong and moderate ANA levels contain autoantibody specificities that predominantly targeted proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, apoptotic processes, and cell death; further denoting reactivity to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. In conclusion, our results further support the notion of routine screening for autoimmune responses in COVID-19 patients, which might help improve disease prognosis and patient management. Further, results provide compelling evidence that ANA-positive individuals should be excluded from being donors for convalescent plasma therapy in the context of Covid-19.",Aisha D.

499,Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vaccinated individuals,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus is consistently evolving with mutations within the receptor binding domain (RBD)1 being of particular concern2-4. To date, there is little research into protection offered following vaccination or infection against RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern (UK3, South African5, Mink6 and Southern California7). To investigate this, serum and saliva samples were obtained from groups of vaccinated (Pfizer BNT-162b28), infected and uninfected individuals. Antibody responses among groups, including salivary antibody response and antibody binding to RBD mutant strains were examined. The neutralization capacity of the antibody response against a patient-isolated South African variant was tested by viral neutralization tests and further verified by an ACE2 competition assay. We found that humoral responses in vaccinated individuals showed a robust response after the second dose. Interestingly, IgG antibodies were detected in large titers in the saliva of vaccinated subjects. Antibody responses showed considerable differences in binding to RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern. A substantial reduction in RBD binding and neutralization was detected for the South African variant. Taken together our data reinforces the importance of administering the second dose of Pfizer BNT-162b2 to acquire high levels of neutralizing antibodies. High antibody titers in saliva suggest that vaccinated individuals may have reduced transmission potential. Substantially reduced neutralization for the South African variant highlights importance of surveillance strategies to detect new variants and targeting these in future vaccines.",Matthias Becker; Alex Dulovic; Daniel Junker; Natalia Ruetalo; Philipp Kaiser; Yudi Pinilla; Constanze Heinzel; Julia Haering; Bjoern Traenkle; Teresa Wagner; Mirjam Layer; Martin Mehrlaender; Valbona Mirakaj; Jana Held; Hannes Planatscher; Katja Schenke-Layland; Gerard Krause; Monika Strengert; Tamam Bakchoul; Karina Althaus; Rolf Fendel; Andrea Kreidenweiss; Michael Koeppen; Ulrich Rothbauer; Michael Schindler; Nicole Schneiderhan-Marra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252958,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252958,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,True
500,Agreement between commercially available ELISA and in-house Luminex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSerological diagnostic of the severe respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a valuable tool for the determination of immunity and surveillance of exposure to the virus. In the context of an ongoing pandemic, it is essential to externally validate widely used tests to assure correct diagnostics and epidemiological estimations. We evaluated the performance of the COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM/A (Vircell, S.L.) against a highly specific and sensitive in-house Luminex immunoassay in a set of samples from pregnant women and cord blood. The agreement between both assays was moderate to high for IgG but low for IgM/A. Considering seropositivity by either IgG and/or IgM/A, the technical performance of the ELISA was highly imbalanced, with 96% sensitivity at the expense of 22% specificity. As for the clinical performance, the negative predictive value reached 87% while the positive predictive value was 51%.

501,High levels of common cold coronavirus antibodies in convalescent plasma are associated with improved survival in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundCOVID-19 Convalescent plasma (CCP) is safe and effective, particularly if given at an early stage of the disease. Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP.

Patients and MethodsPatients [&ge;]18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed.

ResultsCCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex.

SettingUS Veterans Affairs national healthcare system.

ParticipantsEnrollees in the VA healthcare system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 2/28/2020 and 9/30/2020 (n=55,952).

OutcomesDeath, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation within 30 days of testing positive.The incidence of these outcomes was examined among patients infected each month and trends were evaluated using an interrupted time-series analysis.

ResultsBetween February and July 2020, during the first wave of the US pandemic, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), with subsequent stabilization between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and documented symptoms and after additional adjustment for laboratory test results among hospitalized patients, including among subgroups admitted to the ICU and treated with mechanical ventilation. Among hospitalized patients, use of hydroxychloroquine (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%) vasopressors (20.6% to 8.7%), and dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) decreased while use of dexamethasone (3.4% to 53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%) and remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%) increased from February to September.

503,Plasma ACE2 levels predict outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enabling entrance of the virus into cells and causing the infection termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a disease with a very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic and subclinical infection to severe hyperinflammatory syndrome and death.

MethodsThis study used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort with Olink Proteomics). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 outcomes scale. The samples were run on the Olink(R) Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein.

FindingsHigh baseline levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were associated with worse WHOmax category at 28 days with OR=0.56, 95%-CI: 0.44-0.71 (P < 0.0001). This association was significant in regression models with correction for baseline characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and laboratory test results. High levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were also significantly associated with worse WHO category at the time of blood sampling at both day 0, day 3, and day 7 (P = 0.0004, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001, respectively). The levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly higher compared to patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). The plasma ACE2 levels were also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). There was no difference in plasma ACE2 levels comparing patients with or without pre-existing lung disease, diabetes, or immunosuppressive conditions (P = 0.953, P = 0.291, and P = 0.237, respectively). The associations between high plasma levels of ACE2 and worse WHOmax category during 28 days were more pronounced in COVID-19 positive patients compared with COVID-19 negative patients but the difference was not significant in the two-way ANOVA analysis.

InterpretationThis study suggests that measuring ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Further, ACE2 levels could be a link between severe COVID-19 disease and its risk factors, namely hypertension, pre-existing heart disease and pre-existing kidney disease. The design of the data analysis using the Olink platform does not allow assessment of quantitative differences. However, previous studies have described a positive correlation between plasma ACE2 and ACE1 activity. This is interesting because ACE1 (serum ACE) analysis is a standardized test in most hospital laboratories. Therefore, our study encourages quantitative investigations of both plasma ACE 1 and 2 in COVID-19.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) several possible treatments are being compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to receive either usual care plus high titre convalescent plasma or usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.

FindingsBetween 28 May 2020 and 15 January 2021, 5795 patients were randomly allocated to receive convalescent plasma and 5763 to usual care alone. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1398 (24%) of 5795 patients allocated convalescent plasma and 1408 (24%) of 5763 patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 1{middle dot}00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}93 to 1{middle dot}07; p=0{middle dot}93). The 28-day mortality rate ratio was similar in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including in those patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at randomisation. Allocation to convalescent plasma had no significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days (66% vs. 67%; rate ratio 0{middle dot}98; 95% CI 0{middle dot}94-1{middle dot}03, p=0{middle dot}50). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death (28% vs. 29%; rate ratio 0{middle dot}99; 95% CI 0{middle dot}93-1{middle dot}05, p=0{middle dot}79).

InterpretationAmong patients hospitalised with COVID-19, high-titre convalescent plasma did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes.

505,Population-based estimates of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) prevalence and characteristics: A cross-sectional study,"ImportanceEmerging evidence suggests many people have persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 illness.

ObjectiveTo estimate the prevalence and correlates of persistent COVID-19 symptoms 30 and 60 days post onset using a population-based sample.

Design & SettingThe Michigan COVID-19 Recovery Surveillance Study is a population-based cross-sectional survey of a probability sample of adults with confirmed COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). Respondents completed a survey online or via telephone in English, Spanish, or Arabic between June - December 2020.

ParticipantsLiving non-institutionalized adults (aged 18+) in MDSS with COVID-19 onset through mid-April 2020 were eligible for selection (n=28,000). Among 2,000 adults selected, 629 completed the survey. We excluded 79 cases during data collection due to ineligibility, 6 asymptomatic cases, 7 proxy reports, and 24 cases missing outcome data, resulting in a sample size of 593. The sample was predominantly female (56.1%), aged 45 and older (68.2%), and Non-Hispanic White (46.3%) or Black (34.8%).

ExposuresDemographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and annual household income) and clinical factors (smoking status, body mass index, diagnosed comorbidities, and illness severity).

Main outcomes and MeasuresWe defined post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) as persistent symptoms 30+ days (30-day COVID-19) or 60+ days (60-day COVID-19) post COVID-19 onset.

Results30- and 60-day COVID-19 were highly prevalent (52.5% and 35.0%), even among respondents reporting mild symptoms (29.2% and 24.5%) and non-hospitalized respondents (43.7% and 26.9%, respectively). Low income was statistically significantly associated with 30-day COVID-19 in adjusted models. Respondents reporting very severe (vs. mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30-day COVID-19 (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.46-3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.71, 95% 1.02-2.88). Hospitalized (vs. non-hospitalized) respondents had about 40% higher prevalence of both 30-day (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) and 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.93).

Conclusions and RelevancePASC is highly prevalent among cases with severe initial symptoms, and, to a lesser extent, cases with mild and moderate symptoms.",Jana L. Hirschtick; Andrea R.

506,Increased mortality among individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 during the second wave in South Africa,"IntroductionSouth Africa experienced its first wave of COVID-19 peaking in mid-July 2020 and a larger second wave peaking in January 2021, in which the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 lineage predominated. We aimed to compare in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves of COVID-19.

MethodsWe analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 hospitalisations. We defined four wave periods using incidence risk for hospitalisation, pre-wave 1, wave 1, pre-wave 2 and wave 2. We compared the characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 cases in wave 1 and wave 2, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality accounting for wave period using multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsPeak rates of COVID-19 cases, admissions and in-hospital deaths in the second wave exceeded the rates in the first wave (138.1 versus 240.1; 16.7 versus 28.9; and 3.3 versus 7.1 respectively per 100,000 persons). The weekly average incidence risk increase in hospitalisation was 22% in wave 1 and 28% in wave 2 [ratio of growth rate in wave two compared to wave one: 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05]. On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 20% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave (adjusted OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3). In-hospital case fatality-risk (CFR) increased in weeks of peak hospital occupancy, from 17.9% in weeks of low occupancy (<3,500 admissions) to 29.6% in weeks of very high occupancy (>12,500 admissions) (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.5).

Compared to the first wave, individuals hospitalised in the second wave, were more likely to be older, 40-64 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.1] and [&ge;]65 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.1] compared to <40 years; and admitted in the public sector [OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.8]; and less likely to have comorbidities [OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5-0.5].

ConclusionsIn South Africa, the second wave was associated with higher incidence and more rapid increase in hospitalisations, and increased in-hospital mortality. While some of this is explained by increasing pressure on the health system, a residual increase in mortality of hospitalised patients beyond this, could be related to the new lineage 501Y.V2.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT O_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyMost countries have reported higher numbers of COVID-19 cases in the second wave but lower case-fatality risk (CFR), in part due to new therapeutic interventions, increased testing and better prepared health systems. South Africa experienced its second wave which peaked in January 2021, in which the variant of concern, SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 predominated. New variants have been shown to be more transmissible and in the United Kingdom, to be associated with increased hospitalisation and mortality rates in people infected with variant B.1.1.7 compared to infection with non-B.1.1.7 viruses. There are currently limited data on the severity of lineage 501Y.V2.

Added value of this studyWe analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 hospitalisations, comparing in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves of COVID-19. The study revealed that after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 20% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave. Our study also describes the demographic shift from the first to the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa, and quantifies the impact of overwhelmed hospital capacity on in-hospital mortality.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur data suggest that the new lineage (501Y.V2) in South Africa may be associated with increased in-hospital mortality during the second wave. Our data should be interpreted with caution however as our analysis is based on a comparison of mortality in the first and second wave as a proxy for dominant lineage and we did not have individual-level data on lineage. Individual level studies comparing outcomes of people with and without the new lineage based on sequencing data are needed. To prevent high mortality in a potential third wave, we require a combination of strategies to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, to spread out the peak of the epidemic, which would prevent hospital capacity from being breached.

507,A High Rate of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Arabs: Results of a Large-scale Survey,"In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study (36,220 participants) that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects. Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness.

508,COVID-19 is associated with multiple sclerosis exacerbations that are prevented by disease modifying therapies,"BackgroundInfections can trigger exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS). The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on MS are not known. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on new and pre-existing symptoms of MS.

MethodsThe COVID-19 and MS study is an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort study conducted as part of the United Kingdom MS Register. People with MS and COVID-19 were invited by email to complete a questionnaire about their MS symptoms during the infection. An MS exacerbation was defined as developing new MS symptoms and/or worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms.

ResultsFifty-seven percent (230/404) of participants had an MS exacerbation during their infection; 82 developed new MS symptoms, 207 experienced worsened pre-existing MS symptoms, and 59 reported both. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) reduced the likelihood of developing new MS symptoms during the infection (OR 0.556, 95%CI 0.316-0.978). Participants with a higher pre-COVID-19 webEDSS (web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale) score (OR 1.251, 95%CI 1.060-1.478) and longer MS duration (OR 1.042, 95%CI 1.009-1.076) were more likely to experience worsening of their pre-existing MS symptoms during the infection.

509,Efficacy of remdesivir in Japanese patients hospitalised with COVID-19: A large observational study using the COVID-19 Registry Japan,"SynopsisO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSResults from several randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of remdesivir with placebo have been reported. Data on the efficacy of remdesivir in Asian populations are limited, and conflicting results have been reported. The aim of the present study is to examine whether remdesivir is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 or not.

MethodsWe evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir from data acquired from the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of Japanese patients hospitalised with COVID-19, using five-to-one propensity score (PS) matching. Primary outcomes were overall risk of fatality, risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV/ECMO) and length of stay (LoS) in healthcare facilities.

ResultsIn total, 1907 of 15,225 patients met our inclusion criteria. After PS matching, 74 patients were assigned to the remdesivir case group and 195 patients to the non-remdesivir control group. In a PS-matched cohort, fatality risk (12.2% vs 13.3%; P = 1.0); risk of IMV/ECMO (5.4% vs 4.6%; P = 0.757); length of intensive care unit stay (6 vs 6 days; P = 0.473) and length of IMV (13 vs 5 days; P = 0.509) were not different between the case and control groups. LoS in the case group was longer than in the control group (14 vs 11 days; P < 0.001).
