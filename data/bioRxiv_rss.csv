0,Epidemiological and Genomic analysis of a Sydney Hospital COVID-19 Outbreak,"Early COVID-19 experience in Australia involved clusters in northern Sydney, including hospital and aged-care facility (ACF) outbreaks. We explore transmission dynamics, drivers and outcomes of a metropolitan hospital COVID-19 outbreak that occurred in the context of established local community transmission. A retrospective cohort analysis is presented, with integration of viral genome sequencing, clinical and epidemiological data. We demonstrate using genomic epidemiology that the hospital outbreak (n=23) was linked to a concurrent outbreak at a local aged care facility, but was phylogenetically distinct from other community clusters. Thirty day survival was 50% for hospitalised patients (an elderly cohort with significant comorbidities) and 100% for staff. Staff who acquired infection were unable to attend work for a median of 26.5 days (range 14-191); an additional 140 staff were furloughed for quarantine. Transmission from index cases showed a wide dispersion (mean 3.5 persons infected for every patient case and 0.6 persons infected for every staff case). One patient, who received regular nebulised medication prior to their diagnosis being known, acted as an apparent superspreader. No secondary transmissions occurred from isolated cases or contacts who were quarantined prior to becoming infectious. This analysis elaborates the wide-ranging impacts on patients and staff of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission and highlights the utility of genomic analysis as an adjunct to traditional epidemiological investigations. Delayed case recognition resulted in nosocomial transmission but once recognised, prompt action by the outbreak management team and isolation with contact and droplet (without airborne) precautions were sufficient to prevent transmission within this cohort. Our findings support current PPE recommendations in Australia but demonstrate the risk of administering nebulised medications when COVID-19 is circulating locally.",Elaine Tennant; Mel Figtree; Jo Tallon; Rowena Bull; Malinna Yeung; Ira W Deveson; James M Ferguson; Thiruni Adikari; Edward C Holmes; Sebastian Van Hal; Jillian Hammond; Igor Stevanovski; Katerina Mitsakos; Drew Hilditch-Roberts; William D Rawlinson; Bernard Hudson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251943,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
1,Early Antibody Responses Associated with Survival in COVID19 Patients,"Neutralizing antibodies to the SARS CoV-2 spike proteins have been issued Emergency Use Authorizations and are a likely mechanism of vaccines to prevent COVID-19. However, benefit of treatment with monoclonal antibodies has only been observed in clinical trials in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 but not in patients who are hospitalized and/or have advanced disease. To address this observation, we evaluated the timing of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody production in hospitalized patients with the use of a highly sensitive multiplexed bead-based immunoassay allowing for early detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We found that significantly lower levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the first week after symptom onset were associated with patients who expired as compared to patients who were discharged. We also developed a model, based on antibody level trajectory, to predict COVID 19 outcome that is compatible with greater antibody benefit earlier in COVID 19 disease.",Zhao-hua Zhou; Sai Dharmarajan; Mari Lehtimaki; Susan L Kirshner; Steven Kozlowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.21252168,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.21252168,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
2,Hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients quarantined at home: The first interim analysis of a remotely conducted randomized clinical trial,"ABSTRACT Background Older patients are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 disease due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There are few effective treatments for outpatients with COVID-19. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to reduce time in quarantine for symptomatic [&ge;]40 years-old COVID-19 patients. Design A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting Outpatients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 at a University of Pennsylvania affiliated testing center between April 15, 2020 and, July 14, 2020. Participants Out of 5511 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 1072 met initial eligibility criteria for telephonebased recruitment, but only 34 subjects were able to be randomized. Interventions Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg per twice daily (n=17) or matching placebo (n=17), taken orally for up to 14 days. Measurements The primary outcome was the time to release from quarantine. Secondary outcomes included the participant-reported secondary infection of co-inhabitants, hospitalization, treatment-related adverse events, time to symptom improvement, and incidence of cardiac arrhythmia. Results Amaravadi et al - Trial of hydroxychloroquine for outpatient treatment of COVID-19 3 The median time to release from quarantine for HCQ-treated vs. placebo-treated participants was 8 days (range 4-19 days) vs. 11 days (4-18 days); z-score +0.58, p=n.s. This did not meet the pre-specified criteria for early termination, however, this study was terminated early due to lack of feasibility. There was no mortality in either study arm. Limitation Since this study was terminated early due to a lack of feasibility, no conclusion can be made about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients 40 years of age or older quarantined at home. Conclusion The design of this remotely conducted study could guide testing of other more promising agents during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Ravi Amaravadi; Lydia Giles; Mary Carberry; Matthew Craig Hyman; Ian Frank; Sunita Nasta; Jennifer Walsh; E.

3,"Laboratory-Developed Test for SARS-CoV-2 Using Saliva Samples at the University of California, Riverside","Here we describe a relatively quick, simple, economical and accurate laboratory developed test (LDT) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in heated and diluted saliva samples without RNA extraction. Our protocol is a variation of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign SHIELD LDT. Differences include chilling of the samples during dilution and using a reduced volume for the qRT-PCR reactions. The level of detection for our LDT is 3125 copies/ml, which compares favorably with other saliva-based tests. Initial validation studies with a limited number of patient samples have demonstrated excellent agreement between results using our LDT and those obtained from external laboratories. The cost of consumables for our test is under $8 and a throughput of 1000 tests/day can be achieved with 3-4 personnel.",Rong Hai; Matthew Collin; Sophia Tsau; Daniel Raygoza; Juliet Morrison; Alexander J.

4,Risk of death among teachers in England and Wales during the Covid19 pandemic,"Objectives: To use publicly available data on mortality in England and Wales to estimate the extent of occupation risk from Covid19 among teachers and others working in schools. Design: Analysis of national death registration data from the Office for National Statistics. Setting: England and Wales from March 20th to 28th December 2020, during the Covid19 pandemic. Participants: We compared mortality rates among teachers and other school workers to all working aged people and all professional occupations. Primary and Secondary outcomes: Deaths with Covid19 was our primary outcome and death from all causes was our secondary outcome. Results: We found that the absolute mortality rates for deaths with Covid19 were generally low amongst teachers ([&le;]39 per 100,000); they were also low relative to many other occupations. However, both male and female secondary school teachers had slightly higher risks of dying with Covid19 relative to all working aged people and greater risk compared to all professionals, primary school teachers did not have an elevated risk. The mortality risk for all causes was also higher in teachers compared to the working aged population. Excess deaths from all causes were higher among those aged over 65 who were working in schools compared to all over 65s who were currently working and compared to all professionals in this age group. Conclusion: There is weak evidence that secondary school teachers (in particular females) may have a slightly higher risk of Covid19 mortality, but compared to many other occupations their risk is low. Further research is needed to determine why there is a high proportion of excess of deaths which were apparently not due to Covid19 among over 65 year-olds working in schools.",Sarah J Lewis; Kyle Dack; Caroline L Relton; Marcus R Munafo; George Davey Smith,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252143,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
5,Self-reported Memory Problems Eight Months after Non-Hospitalized COVID-19 in a Large Cohort,"Background: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 range from ageusia and anosmia, experienced by most patients, to altered consciousness and rare and severe encephalopathy. A direct affection of the central nervous system (CNS) in the disease has been supported by animal models and MRI findings in patients with mild and severe symptoms. Here we report eight-month data on memory problems for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and untested volunteers. Objective: To explore the association between non-hospitalized COVID-19 eight months previously and self-reported memory problems. Methods: We followed a cohort of 13156 participants that was invited after (1) being tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a combined oropharyngeal- and nasopharyngeal swab or (2) randomly selected from the Norwegian population (untested). Participants completed online baseline- and follow-up questionnaires detailing underlying medical conditions, demographics, symptoms, and items from the RAND-36 questionnaire on health-related quality of life and known confounders for memory problems. Results: After repeated invitations, the participation rate was 40% (N=794) of SARS-CoV-2 positive, 26% (N=7993) of negative, and 22% (N=4369) of untested randomly selected invitees. All participants completed the baseline questionnaire as a part of inclusion. The follow-up period was 248 days (SD=18) from baseline, and the follow-up questionnaire was completed by 75% of SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, 65% of negative participants, and 73% of untested randomly selected participants. At follow-up, 49 (11.5%) of the SARS-CoV-2 positive participants reported memory problems in contrast to 173 (4.1%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative participants and 65 (2.4%) of the untested randomly selected participants. In a multivariate model, SARS-CoV-2 positivity remained strongly associated with reporting memory problems at eight months follow-up compared to the SARS-CoV-2 negative group (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-5.2) and the untested group (OR 4.9, 95% CI 3.4-7.2). Compared to the other groups, SARS-CoV-2 positive participants also reported more concentration problems and a significant worsening of health compared to one year ago at follow-up. Feeling depressed, less energy, or pain were reported relatively equally by the different groups. Summary: We find that 11.5% of COVID-19 patients experience memory problems eight months after the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, and the long-term consequences of infections are therefore unknown. Our results show that a relatively high proportion of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients report memory problems eight months after the disease.",Arne Soraas; Ragnhild Ro; Karl T Kalleberg; Merete Ellingjord-Dale; Nils I Landro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252151,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252151,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
6,Bamlanivimab does not neutralize two SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying E484K in vitro,"The IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) prevents viral attachment and entry into human cells by blocking attachment to the ACE2 receptor. However, whether bamlanivimab is equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants of concern (VOC) is not fully known. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine whether bamlanivimab is equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 emerging VOC. The ability of bamlanivimab to neutralize five SARS-CoV-2 variants including B.1.1.7 (mutations include N501Y and del69/70), B.1.351 (mutations include E484K and N501Y) and P.2 (mutations include E484K in the absence of a N501Y mutation) was analyzed in infectious cell culture using CaCo2 cells. Additionally, we analyzed vaccine-elicited sera after immunization with BNT162b2, and convalescent sera for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. We found that the variant B.1.1.7, as well as two isolates from early 2020 (FFM1 and FFM7) could be efficiently neutralized by bamlanivimab (titer 1/1280, respectively), however, no neutralization effect could be detected against either B.1.135 or P.2, both harboring the E484K substitution. Vaccine-elicited sera showed slightly decreased neutralizing activity against B1.1.7, B.1.135 and P.2 Our in vitro findings indicate that, in contrast to vaccine-elicited sera, bamlanivimab may not provide efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring the E484K substitution. Confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, including screening for E484K, may be needed before initiating mAb treatment with bamlanivimab to ensure both efficacious and efficient use of the antibody product. Hence, variant-specific mAb agents may be required to treat emerging VOC.",Marek Widera; Alexander Wilhelm; Sebastian Hoehl; Christiane Pallas; Niko Kohmer; Timo Wolf; Holger F Rabenau; Victor M Corman; Christian Drosten; Maria JGT Vehreschild; Udo Goetsch; Rene Gottschalk; Sandra Ciesek,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252372,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252372,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
7,COVID-19 symptom frequency comparison: non-hospitalised positively and negatively tested persons with flu-like symptoms in Austria,"Background A large number of studies report COVID-19 symptom frequencies but most studies focus on hospitalized patients. Therefore reported symptom frequencies vary and their applicability to the general population is limited. Here we report COVID-19 symptom frequencies for the general population of a central European country. Methods In a collaboration between the Vienna Social Fund (FSW) and the AI-biotech company Symptoma we report symptom frequencies based on the COVID-19 chatbot of the city government of Vienna and corresponding PCR-test results. Chatbot users answered 13 yes/no questions about symptoms and provided information about age and sex. Subsequently a medically trained professional came to their address to take a sample and PCR results were obtained. Findings Between November 2 and January 5, a total of 3011 persons experiencing flu-like symptoms had a PCR-test by a medical professional at home and completed the chatbot session prior to the test, 816 (27.1%) of them were COVID-19 positive. We compared the symptom frequencies between COVID-19 positive and negative users, and between male and female users. The symptoms (sorted by frequency) of users with positive PCR-test are malaise (81.1%), fatigue (72.9%), headache (64.1%), cough (57.7%), fever (50.7%), sore throat (40.7%), close contact with COVID-19 cases (34.9%), rhinorrhea (31.0%), sneezing (28.4%), dysgeusia (27.1%), hyposmia (26.5%), dyspnea (11.4%) and diarrhea (10.9%). Among these, cough, fever, hyposmia, dysgeusia, malaise, headache, close contact with COVID-19 case and fatigue are significantly (P < 0.01) increased in COVID-19 positive persons while dyspnea, diarrhea and sore throat are significantly (P < 0.01) decreased in COVID-19 positive persons. There was no significant difference for rhinorrhea and sneezing.",Nicolas Munsch; Stefanie Gruarin; Alistair Martin; Jama Nateqi; Thomas Lutz; Judith Aberle; Bernhard Knapp,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252426,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252426,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
8,Longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence using multiple serology platforms,"Serological tests are important tools helping to determine previous infection with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to monitor immune responses. The current tests are based on spike (S), the receptor binding domain (RBD), or the nucleoprotein (NP) as substrate. Here, we used samples from a high seroprevalence cohort of health care workers (HCWs) to perform a longitudinal analysis of the antibody responses using three distinct serological assays. 501 serum samples were tested using: a) a research-grade RBD and spike based tandem enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MS-RBD ELISA, MS-spike ELISA), b) a commercial RBD and spike based tandem ELISA (Kantaro-RBD, -spike), and c) a commercial NP-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA, Abbott Architect). Seroprevalence ranged around 28% during the early stage of the pandemic (a: 28.4% positives; b: 28.1%; c: 27.3%). Good correlation was observed between the MS and Kantaro RBD ELISAs and between the MS and Kantaro spike ELISAs. By contrast, modest correlations were observed between the Abbott Architect and both RBD and spike-based assays. A proportion of HCWs (n=178) were sampled again 3-5 months after the first time point. Although antibody levels declined in most of the positive individuals, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD-spike based assays remained unchanged. However the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined. Lastly, we tested six samples of individuals who received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and found that seroconversion was detected by the RBD-spike assays but, of course as expected, not the NP based assay. In summary, our results consolidate the strength of different serological assays to assess the magnitude and duration of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.",Juan Manuel Carreno; Damodara Rao Mendu; Viviana Simon; Masood A Shariff; Gagandeep Singh; Vidya Menon; Florian Krammer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252340,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252340,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
9,Control of COVID-19 transmission on an urban university campus during a second wave of the pandemic,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic had a wide-ranging impact on educational institutions across the United States. Given potential financial challenges and adverse psychosocial effects of campus closure, as done in the spring of 2020 in response to the first wave, many institutions of higher education developed strategies to allow campuses to reopen and operate in the fall despite the ongoing threat of COVID-19. Many however opted to have limited campus re-opening in order to minimize potential risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2. Objective: To analyze how Boston University (BU) fully reopened its campus in the fall of 2020 and controlled COVID-19 transmission despite worsening transmission in the city of Boston. Design: Multi-faceted intervention case study. Setting: Large urban university campus. Interventions: The BU response included a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing facility with capacity to delivery results in less than 24 hours; routine asymptomatic screening for COVID-19; daily health attestations; compliance monitoring and feedback; robust contact tracing, quarantine and isolation in on campus facilities; face mask use; enhanced hand hygiene; social distancing recommendations; de-densification of classrooms and public places; and enhancement of all building air systems. Main Outcomes and Measures: Between August and December 2020, BU conducted >500,000 COVID-19 tests and identified 719 individuals with COVID-19: 627 (87.2%) students, 11 (1.5%) faculty, and 212 (25.5%) staff. Overall, about 1.8% of the BU community tested positive. Infections among faculty and staff were mostly acquired off campus, while undergraduate infections were more likely acquired in non-classroom campus settings. Of 837 close contacts traced, 86 (10.3%) tested positive for COVID-19. BU contact tracers identified a source of transmission for 51.5% of cases with 55.7% identifying a source outside of BU. Among infected faculty and staff with a known source of infection, the majority reported a transmission source outside of BU (100% for faculty and 79.8% for staff). Conclusions and Relevance: BU was successful in containing COVID-19 transmission on campus while minimizing off campus acquisition of COVID-19 from the greater Boston area. A coordinated strategy of testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, with robust management and oversight, can control COVID-19 transmission, even in an urban university setting.",Davidson H Hamer; Laura White; Helen E Jenkins; christopher J gill; Hannah N.

10,The Public Health Impact of Delaying a Second Dose of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccine,"Objectives: To estimate population health outcomes under delayed-second-dose versus standard schedule SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Design: Agent-based modeling on a simulated population of 100,000 based on a real-world US county. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. To test the robustness of these findings, simulations were performed under different estimates for single-dose efficacy and vaccine administration rates, and under the possibility that a vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread. Setting: population level simulation. Participants: 100,000 agents are included in the simulation, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts are established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions Interventions: we simulate standard Covid-19 vaccination, versus delayed-second-dose vaccination prioritizing first dose. Sensitivity analyses include first-dose vaccine efficacy of 70%, 80% and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread; and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed-second-dose only for those under 65 years of age. Main outcome measures: cumulative Covid-19 mortality over 180 days, cumulative infections and hospitalizations. Results: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100,000 for standard versus delayed second dose was 226 vs 179; 233 vs 207; and 235 vs 236; for 90%, 80% and 70% first-dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed-second-dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80%, and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% population per day, both under sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100,000. The delayed-second-dose for those under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested. Conclusions: A delayed-second-dose vaccination strategy, at least for those under 65, could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions.",Santiago Romero-Brufau; Ayush Chopra; Alex J Ryu; Esma Gel; Ramesh Raskar; Walter Kremers; Karen Anderson; Jayakumar Subramanian; Balaji Krishnamurthy; Abhishek Singh; Kalyan Pasupathy; Yue Dong; John C O'Horo; Walter R Wilson; Oscar Mitchell; Thomas C Kingsley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252299,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252299,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
11,Virtual handover of patients in the pediatric intensive care unit during COVID-19 crisis,"Objectives: A key measure to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been social distancing. Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians' experience of using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: qualitative content analysis Setting: PICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Subjects: PICU Physicians Interventions: Due to the pandemic, the hospital's PICU used Zoom as a remote conferencing application, instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review board approval, data were collected over two weeks (July 1, 2020 to July 14, 2020). Measurements: Demographic data and narrative descriptions of the perceived efficacy of remote handover were collected using open-ended questions through a created online link. The analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. Main Results: All 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. They had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were comfortable conducting a remote endorsement. Most found that Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings. Conclusions: Video-conferencing applications used for online handovers could supplement traditional face-to-face intensive care unit patient endorsement during outbreaks of infectious diseases. The use of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be encouraged to optimize the users' experience.",Mohamad-Hani Temsah; Noura Abouammoh; Ahmad Ashry; Ayman Al-Eyadhy; Ali Alhaboob; Fahad Alsohime; Mohammed Almazyad; Majed Alabdulhafid; Reem Temsah; Fadi Aljamaan; Amr Jamal; Rabih Halwani; Khalid Alhasan; Jafar A.

12,Obesity may hamper SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity,"Background: The first goal of the study was to analyse the antibody titre 7 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of 248 healthcare workers (HCW). The second goal was to analyse how the antibody titre changes in correlation with age, gender and BMI. Methods: Participants were assigned to receive the priming dose at baseline and booster dose at day 21. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and 7 days after second dose of vaccine. A questionnaire was used to collect data on health characteristics of participants. Results: 248 HWCs were analysed, 158 women (63.7%) and 90 men (36.3%). After the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, 99.5% of participants developed a humoral immune response. The geometric mean concentration of antibodies among the vaccinated subjects after booster dose (285.9 AU/mL 95% CI: 249.5-327.7); was higher than that of human convalescent sera (39.4 AU/mL, 95% CI: 33.1-46.9), with p<0.0001. The antibody titre was found to be more elevated in young and female participants. A strong correlation of BMI classes with antibody titres was noticed: humoral response was more efficient in the group with under- and normal-weight vs the group with pre- and obesity participants (p<0.0001 at T1). Conclusions: These findings imply that females, lean and young people have an increased capacity to mount humoral immune responses compared to males, overweight and the older population. Although further studies are needed, this data may have important implications for the development of vaccination strategies for COVID-19, particularly in obese people.",Raul Pellini; Aldo Venuti; Fulvia Pimpinelli; Elva Abril; GIovanni Blandino; Flaminia Campo; Laura Conti; Armando De Virgilio; Federico De Marco; Enea GIno Di Domenico; Ornella Di Bella; Simona Di Martino; Fabrizio Ensoli; Diana Giannarelli; Chiara Mandoj; Valentina Manciocco; Paolo Marchesi; Francesco Mazzola; Silvia Moretto; Gerardo Petruzzi; Fabrizio Petrone; Barbara Pichi; Martina Pontone; Jacopo Zocchi; Antonello Vidiri; Branka Vujovic; GIulia Piaggio; Aldo Morrone; Gennaro Ciliberto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21251664,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21251664,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
13,Longitudinal protection following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and early vaccine responses: insights from a cohort of community based dental health care professionals,"Abstract Background The threshold of protection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies and their longevity are not known. Interpretation of serological results in with respect to international reference material can inform this essential question. Methods 1,507 West Midlands dental care professionals were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was determined and the cohort was followed longitudinally for 6 months until January/February 2021 through the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, and commencement of vaccination. Results Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3% in this cohort, compared to estimates in the general population of between 6-7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3 and 6-month follow up and conferred a 74% reduced risk of infection. During follow-up, no PCR-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. Post-vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in individuals with who were seropositive at baseline. Conclusion Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6 months after initial sampling and 9 months from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory.

14,Epidemiological Philosophy of Pandemics,"Objectives: Currents estimates of total cases of COVID-19 are largely based on previously determined case fatality rates (CFR)s. The background theory in this study is based on two: There is no evidence that during epidemics CFR is fixed throughout time or place and there is evidence that viral load (dense of infection) leads to more fatalities. Study Design: This study was done to look for any relationship between mortality rate (MR) presented as deaths/ million (M) population with both of the total cases / (M) population (density of infection) and of CFR. We chose 31 countries with testing coverage > 400,0000 tests /M and with> 1 million population. Methods: We used ANOVA regression analyses for testing the associations. Results: CRF is not a fixed ratio as it changed with a change in (MR). The COVID-19 deaths / million data were fit to calculate the total cases through the equation: total deaths /M =0.006593 X (total cases to the power 1.016959) with a too highly significant correlation between total deaths / 1M and total cases (P-value 0.0000). There was a high positive influence of COVID-19 MR on the CFR (P-value = 0.0002) by non-linear regression (power model), through the equation: CFR = (0.093200) X (total deaths/ M.) to the power 0.366580 Conclusions: There is new evidence of using MR for estimation of CFR and total cases through uniform formulas applicable during this pandemic and possibly for every epidemic. This evidence gives us an understandable idea about epidemics' behavior.",Tareef Fadhil Raham,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252304,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252304,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
15,Scalable Epidemiological Workflows to Support COVID-19 Planning and Response,"The COVID-19 global outbreak represents the most significant epidemic event since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Simulations have played a crucial role in supporting COVID-19 planning and response efforts. Developing scalable workflows to provide policymakers quick responses to important questions pertaining to logistics, resource allocation, epidemic forecasts and intervention analysis remains a challenging computational problem. In this work, we present scalable high performance computing-enabled workflows for COVID-19 pandemic planning and response. The scalability of our methodology allows us to run fine-grained simulations daily, and to generate county-level forecasts and other counter-factual analysis for each of the 50 states (and DC), 3140 counties across the USA. Our workflows use a hybrid cloud/cluster system utilizing a combination of local and remote cluster computing facilities, and using over 20,000 CPU cores running for 6--9 hours every day to meet this objective. Our state (Virginia), state hospital network, our university, the DOD and the CDC use our models to guide their COVID-19 planning and response efforts.

16,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices towards SARS-COV-2 Infection in the United Arab Emirates Population: a Cross-sectional Survey-based Study","In the current situation involving the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the disease containment depends mainly on the populations preventive practices and self-isolation. In this study, we explored the adult populations approach towards COVID-19 in UAE between the 4th and 14th of April 2020. We used a community-based, cross-sectional study using a self-administered electronic questionnaire covering five different aspects: demographics, knowledge, practice, attitude, source and trust of information, and a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2) for depression screening. A total of 1,867 people responded to the survey. Knowledge results were better in people with higher education levels, non-UAE nationals, those with a higher PHQ-2 score, or with a positive contact history with a SARS-COV-2 infected patient. The best practice scores were shown by participants with high knowledge scores and education levels. Depression risk was significantly higher in men, non-UAE nationals, in those with lower knowledge scores, and younger ages. The most followed practices were staying home, handwashing, avoiding social gatherings, limiting three people per vehicle, and avoiding public transportation. The least practiced measures were covering the face while sneezing or coughing and wearing masks. Although staying home was reported by 92.5% of participants, 22.6% mentioned that they were visited by more than 2 people and visited others in 18.4% during the last week. Social media was the source of information for 82.1% of the participants, and most trusted doctors and healthcare providers. A depression risk was present in 18.9% of the participants and the majority of respondents agreed that SARS-COV-2 infection will finally be successfully controlled. The obtained results on knowledge and practices, although satisfactory, could be insufficient to prevent this pandemic from being contained.

17,Association between Functional Inhibitors of Acid Sphingomyelinase and Reduced Risk of Intubation or Death in Individuals Hospitalized for Severe COVID-19: results from an observational multicenter study,"Several medications commonly used for a number of medical conditions share a property of functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), or FIASMA. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that the (ASM)/ceramide system may be central to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA use among patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 in an observational multicenter retrospective study conducted at Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 2,846 adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 277 (9.7%) were taking a FIASMA medication at the time of their hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation and/or death. We compared this endpoint between patients taking vs. not taking a FIASMA medication in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and medical comorbidities. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 days (SD=12.5), the primary endpoint occurred in 104 patients (37.5%) who were taking a FIASMA medication, and 1,060 patients (41.4%) who were not. Taking a FIASMA medication was associated with reduced likelihood of intubation or death in both crude (HR=0.71; 95%CI=0.58-0.87; p<0.001) and the primary IPW (HR=0.58; 95%CI=0.46-0.72; p<0.001) analyses. This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses and was not specific to one FIASMA class or medication. These results show the potential importance of the ASM/ceramide system as a treatment target in COVID-19.

18,The neurology and neuropsychiatry of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the early literature reveals frequent CNS manifestations and key emerging narratives,"Objectives There is accumulating evidence of the neurological and neuropsychiatric features of infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to describe the characteristics of the early literature and estimate point prevalences for neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL up to 18 July 2020 for randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and case series. Studies reporting prevalences of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms were synthesised into meta-analyses to estimate pooled prevalence. Results 13,292 records were screened by at least two authors to identify 215 included studies, of which there were 37 cohort studies, 15 case-control studies, 80 cross-sectional studies and 83 case series from 30 countries. 147 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The symptoms with the highest prevalence were anosmia (43.1% [35.2-51.3], n=15,975, 63 studies), weakness (40.0% [27.9-53.5], n=221, 3 studies), fatigue (37.8% [31.6-44.4], n=21,101, 67 studies), dysgeusia (37.2% [30.0-45.3], n=13,686, 52 studies), myalgia (25.1% [19.8-31.3], n=66.268, 76 studies), depression (23.0 % [11.8-40.2], n=43,128, 10 studies), headache (20.7% [95% CI 16.1-26.1], n=64,613, 84 studies), anxiety (15.9% [5.6-37.7], n=42,566, 9 studies) and altered mental status (8.2% [4.4-14.8], n=49,326, 19 studies). Heterogeneity for most clinical manifestations was high. Conclusions Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 in the pandemic's early phase are varied and common.

19,Risk factors for increased COVID-19 case-fatality in the United States: A county-level analysis during the first wave,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant morbidity and mortality across the US. In this ecological study, we identified county-level variables associated with the COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) using publicly available datasets and a negative binomial generalized linear model. Variables associated with decreased CFR included a greater number of hospitals per 10,000 people, banning religious gatherings, a higher percentage of people living in mobile homes, and a higher percentage of uninsured people. Variables associated with increased CFR included a higher percentage of the population over age 65, a higher percentage of Black or African Americans, a higher asthma prevalence, and a greater number of hospitals in a county. By identifying factors that are associated with COVID-19 CFR in US counties, we hope to help officials target public health interventions and healthcare resources to locations that are at increased risk of COVID-19 fatalities.",Jess A.

20,A national mixed-mode seroprevalence random population-based cohort on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: the socio-epidemiological EpiCov study,"Background: the EpiCov study, initiated at the end of the first national lockdown in France, aimed to provide national and regional estimates of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to analyze relations between living conditions and the dynamics of the epidemic. We present and discuss here the survey methodology, and describe the first-round fieldwork. Method: 371,000 individuals aged 15 years or more were randomly selected from the national tax register, stratified by departments, including three overseas departments, and by poverty level with over-representation of people living below the poverty line. Health, socio-economics, migration history, and living conditions were collected through self-computed-assisted web interviews or via computer-assisted telephone interviews. The first-round survey was conducted in May. A random subsample was eligible to receive material for home blood self-sample on dried blood spot (DBS), in order to detect IgG antibodies against the spike protein (Euroimmun ELISA-S), and neutralizing antibodies for non-negative ELISA-S. For the second-round conducted in November, all respondents were eligible for the antibodies detection from home DBS sample, as well as the other household members aged 6 years or more for 20% of them. Participation and adjustment for nonresponse: 134,391 respondents completed the first-round questionnaire from May 2 to June 1, 2020, including 16,970 (12.6%) respondents under the poverty line. Multimodal web/tel interviews was randomly assigned to 20% of the sample. The other were assigned to exclusive CAWI. Overall 17,441 respondents were eligible for home blood sample, among them 12,114 returned the DBS (interquartile date: May 25- June 5). The response probability was first estimated from logit models adjusted on a wide range of auxiliary demographic and socio-economic variables available from the sampling frame, and final weights calibrated to the margins of the population census permitted to correct for a large part of the non-response bias. Conclusion: The Epicov study is one of the largest national random population-based seroprevalence cohort, with both an epidemiological and sociological approaches to evaluate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, and the impact on health and living conditions. One of the major interests of this study is the broad coverage of the socio-economic and territorial diversity of the population.",Josiane WARSZAWSKI; Nathalie BAJOS; Muriel BARLET; Xavier de LAMBALLERIE; Delphine RAHIB; Nathalie LYDIE; Sylvain DURRLEMAN; Remy SLAMA; Remonie SENG; Philippe RAYNAUD; Aude LEDUC; Guillaume BAGEIN; Nicolas PALIOD; Stephane LEGLEYE; Cyril FAVRE-MARTINOZ; Laura CASTELL; Patrick SILLARD; Laurence Meyer; Francois BECK; - The EPICOV study group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252316,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252316,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True
21,Heterogeneous Mental Health Development During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom,"Aim. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation measures by governments have upended the economic and social lives of many, leading to widespread psychological distress. However, how distress developed during the pandemic and who was most affected is poorly understood. We explore heterogeneity in trajectories of psychological distress during the first six months of the pandemic in the United Kingdom and relate this heterogeneity to socio-demographic and health factors. Subjects and Methods. We analyze six waves of longitudinal, nationally representative survey data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N = 15,218), covering the first lockdown in 2020. First, latent class mixture modelling (LCCM) is used to identify trajectories of psychological distress. Second, associations of the trajectories with covariates are tested with multinomial logistic regressions. Results. We find four different trajectories of distress: continuously low, continuously moderate, temporarily elevated, and continuously elevated distress. One-fifth of the population experienced severely elevated risks of distress. Long-term exposure was highest among younger people, women, those who lost income, and those with previous health conditions or COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusion. Given the threat of persistent stress on health, policy measures should be sensitized to the unintended yet far-reaching consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions.",Lea Ellwardt; Patrick Praeg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21251565,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21251565,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True

Many students volunteered to provide clinical support. Volunteering to work in a clinical capacity was a unique medical education opportunity; however, it is unknown whether this was a positive learning experience or which volunteering roles were of most benefit to students. Methods and Design: The COVIDReady2 study is a national cross-sectional study of all medical students at UK medical schools. The primary outcome is to explore the experiences of medical students who volunteered during the pandemic in comparison to those who did not. We will compare responses to determine the educational benefit and issues they faced. In addition to quantitative analysis, thematic analysis will be used to identify themes in qualitative responses. Discussion: There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that service roles have potential to enhance medical education; yet, there is a shortage of studies able to offer practical advice for how these roles may be incorporated in future medical education. We anticipate that this study will help to identify volunteer structures that have been beneficial for students, so that similar infrastructures can be used in the future, and help inform medical education in a non-pandemic setting.",Matthew H V Byrne; James Ashcroft; Laith Alexander; Jonathan C M Wan; Anmol Arora; Megan E L Brown; Anna Harvey; Andrew Clelland; Nicholas Schindler; Cecilia Brassett; Rachel Allan; - MedEd Collaborative,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252103,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252103,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True

Methods: Standardized neuropsychological, psychiatric, neurological and olfactory tests were administered to 45 patients (categorized according to the severity of their respiratory symptoms during the acute phase) 236.51 (SD: 22.54) days post-discharge following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Deficits were found in all the domains of cognition and the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was also high in the three groups. The severe performed more poorly on long-term episodic memory and exhibited greater anosognosia. The moderate had poorer emotion recognition, which was positively correlated with persistent olfactory dysfunction. The mild were more stressed, anxious and depressed.

24,An empirical analysis of what people learned about COVID-19 through a web search and the impacts on misinformation and attitude towards public health safety guidelines.,"Several people flocked to the Internet to learn about the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 after the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As the novel coronavirus spread rapidly worldwide and was declared a global pandemic, the public rushed to Internet platforms to learn about the outbreak through Google search, online news outlets, and social media platforms. This paper evaluates the public's web search to learn about the pandemic and the possible impacts on attitude to the public health guidelines. The results highlight four outcomes: First, a significant global population learned about the ongoing pandemic through a web search. Second, there is a direct correlation between learning SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and SARS-CoV and searching for information on public health measures (wearing a facial mask and social distancing). Third, learning conspiracy theories or misinformation correspond with a lack of interest in gaining knowledge about public health safety guidelines. Also, the initial high interest in learning about Influenza declined as people gained information about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. The results highlight the critical need to promptly sensitize the public about global health concerns using both the Internet platforms and traditional sources, adopt effective health communication strategies, and build trust.",Ikpe Justice Akpan; Obianuju Genevieve Aguolu; Asuama A.

This paper sets out to examine whether the magnitude of the sex differences in the COVID-19 mortality rate are unusual when compared to other common causes of death. In doing so, we aim to provide evidence as to whether the causal pathways for the sex differences in the mortality rate of COVID-19 likely differ from those for other causes of death. We found that sex differences in the age-standardized COVID-19 mortality rate were substantially larger than for the age-standardized all-cause mortality rate and most other common causes of death.

The mechanisms behind this association remain elusive. Methods: We evaluated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viremia, disease outcome, inflammatory and proteomic profiles in a cohort of COVID-19 emergency department participants. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured using qRT-PCR based platform. Proteomic data were generated with Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) using the Olink platform. Results: Three hundred participants with nucleic acid test-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Levels of plasma SARS-CoV-2 viremia at the time of presentation predicted adverse disease outcomes, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 10.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4, 25.5, P<0.001) for severe disease (mechanical ventilation and/or 28-day mortality) and aOR of 3.9 (95%CI 1.5, 10.1, P=0.006) for 28-day mortality. Proteomic analyses revealed prominent proteomic pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, including upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, CTSL, FURIN), heightened markers of tissue damage to the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, endothelium/vasculature and alterations in coagulation pathways. Conclusions: These results highlight the cascade of vascular and tissue damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia that underlies its ability to predict COVID-19 disease outcomes.",Yijia Li; Alexis M Schneider; Arnav Mehta; Moshe Sade-Feldman; Kyle R Kays; Matteo Gentili; Nicole C Charland; Anna LK Gonye; Irena Gushterova; Hargun K Khanna; Thomas J LaSalle; Kendall M Lavin-Parsons; Brendan M Lilley; Carl L Lodenstein; Kasidet Manakongtreecheep; Justin D Margolin; Brenna N McKaig; Blair A Parry; Maricarmen Rojas-Lopez; Brian C Russo; Nihaarika Sharma; Jessica Tantivit; Molly F Thomas; James Regan; James P Flynn; Alexandra-Chloe Villani; Nir Hacohen; Marcia B Goldberg; Michael R Filbin; Jonathan Z Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252357,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252357,2021-02-26,2021-02-26,,True

Since, we have confirmed 136 patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) until February 2021. Here, we conducted the whole genome sequencing analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on samples from 70 of 136 patients (51.5%). These patients were infected in Diamond Princess cruise ship (n=1), Africa (n=2), Japan (n=66) and Brazil (n=1). The viral genome sequence of a patient on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020 was similar to that of original strain found in Wuhan, China (19A clade). Four patients, including two returnees from Africa and two lived in Japan, confirmed at the end of March 2020 had sequences similar to those of lineage with D614G mutation, which was endemic in Europe (20A [n=3] and 20B [n=1] clade). The 64 Japanese patients confirmed from September 2020 to January 2021 had sequences similar to those of the currently prevalent lineage (20B [n=58] and 20C clade [n=6]). Subsequent analysis revealed three mutations (K417T/ E484K / N501Y) in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein in a man in his 40s.

Data sources WHO covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature to 19 January 2021, and six additional Chinese databases to 20 January 2021. Study selection Randomized trials in which people at risk of covid-19 were randomized to drug prophylaxis or no prophylaxis (standard care or placebo). Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles. Methods After duplicate data abstraction, we conducted random-effects bayesian network meta-analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included studies using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results The first iteration of this living network meta-analysis includes nine randomized trials: six addressing hydroxychloroquine (6,059 participants), one addressing ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan (234 participants) and two addressing ivermectin alone (540 participants), all compared to standard care or placebo. Hydroxychloroquine has no important effect on admission to hospital (risk difference (RD) 1 fewer per 1,000, 95% credible interval (CrI) 3 fewer to 4 more, high certainty) or mortality (RD 1 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 2 fewer to 3 more, high certainty). Hydroxychloroquine probably has no important effect on laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 2 more per 1,000, 95% CrI 18 fewer to 28 more, moderate certainty), probably increases adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation (RD 19 more per 1,000, 95% CrI 1 fewer to 70 more, moderate certainty) and may have no important effect on suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 15 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 64 fewer to 41 more, low certainty). Due to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, and thus very low certainty evidence, the effects of ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan on laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 52 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 58 fewer to 37 fewer), and ivermectin alone on laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 50 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 59 fewer to 16 fewer) and suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 159 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 165 fewer to 144 fewer) remain uncertain. Conclusion Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis does not have an important effect on hospital admission and mortality, probably increases adverse effects, and probably does not have an important effect on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, we are highly uncertain whether ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan and ivermectin alone reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

29,A Comprehensive County Level Framework to Identify Factors Affecting Hospital Capacity and Predict Future Hospital Demand,"Background: As of February 19, 2021, our review yielded a small number of studies that investigated high resolution hospitalization demand data from a public health planning perspective. The earlier studies compiled were conducted early in the pandemic and do not include any analysis of the hospitalization trends in the last 3 months when the US experienced a substantial surge in hospitalization and ICU demand. The earlier studies also focused on COVID 19 transmission influence on COVID 19 hospitalization rates. While this emphasis is understandable, there is evidence to suggest that non COVID hospitalization demand is being displaced due to the hospitalization and ICU surge. Further, with the discovery of multiple mutated variants of COVID 19, it is important to remain vigilant in an effort to control the pandemic. Given these circumstances, the development of a high resolution framework that examines overall hospitalizations and ICU usage rate for COVID and non COVID patients would allow us to build a prediction system that can identify potential vulnerable locations for hospitalization capacity in the nation so that appropriate remedial measures can be planned. Method: The current study recognizes that COVID 19 has affected overall hospitalizations, not only COVID 19 hospitalizations. Drawing from the recently released Department of Health and Human services (DHH) weekly hospitalization data (or the time period August 28th , 2020 to January 22nd, 2021.), we study the overall hospitalization and ICU usage as two components: COVID 19 hospitalization and ICU per capita rates; and non COVID hospitalization and ICU per capita rates. A mixed linear mixed model is adopted to study the response variables in our study. The estimated models are subsequently employed to generate predictions for county level hospitalization and ICU usage rates in the future under a host of COVID 19 transmission scenarios considering the new variants of COVID 19 and vaccination impacts. Findings: We find a significant association of the virus transmissibility with COVID (positive) and non COVID (negative) hospitalization and ICU usage rates. Several county level factors including demographics, mobility and health indicators are also found to be strongly associated with the overall hospitalization and ICU demand. Among the various scenarios considered, the results indicate a small possibility of a new wave of infections that can substantially overload hospitalization and ICU usage. In the scenario where vaccinations proceed as expected reducing transmission, our results indicate that hospitalizations and ICU usage rates are likely to reduce significantly. Interpretation: The research exercise presents a framework to predict evolving hospitalization and ICU usage trends in response to COVID 19 transmission rates while controlling for other factors. Our work highlights how future hospitalization demand varies by location and time in response to a range of pessimistic and optimistic scenarios. Further, the exercise allows us to identify vulnerable counties and regions under stress with high hospitalization and ICU rates that can be assisted with remedial measures. The model will also allow hospitals to understand evolving displaced non COVID hospital demand.",Tanmoy Bhowmik; Naveen Eluru,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252117,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252117,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
30,Practical strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in resource-constrained settings,"Background: Standard nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR is not always feasible due to limitations in trained personnel, personal protective equipment, swabs, PCR reagents, and access to cold chain and biosafety hoods. Methods: We piloted the collection of nasal mid-turbinate swabs amenable to self-testing, including both standard polyester flocked swabs as well as 3D printed plastic lattice swabs, placed into either viral transport media or an RNA stabilization agent. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 viral detection by RT-qPCR was compared to that obtained by nasopharyngeal sampling as the reference standard. Pooling specimens in the lab versus pooling swabs at the point of collection was also evaluated. Results: Among 275 participants, flocked nasal swabs identified 104/121 individuals who were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal sampling (sensitivity 87%, 95% CI 79-92%), mostly missing those with low viral load (<10^3 viral copies/uL). 3D-printed nasal swabs showed similar sensitivity. When nasal swabs were placed directly into an RNA stabilizer, the mean 1.4 log decrease in viral copies/uL compared to nasopharyngeal samples was reduced to <1 log, even when samples were left at room temperature for up to 7 days. Pooling sample specimens or swabs both successfully detected samples >102 viral copies/uL. Conclusions: Nasal swabs are likely adequate for clinical diagnosis of acute infections to help expand testing capacity in resource-constrained settings. When collected into an RNA preservative that also inactivates infectious virus, nasal swabs yielded quantitative viral loads approximating those obtained by nasopharyngeal sampling.",Meredith Smith Muller; Srijana Bhattarai Chhetri; Christopher Basham; Tyler Rapp; Feng-Chang Lin; Kelly Lin; Daniel Westreich; Carla Cerami; Jonathan J.

31,The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH): Protocol for a prospective longitudinal cohort study of healthcare and ancillary workers in UK healthcare settings,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality, and has devastated economies in many countries. Amongst the groups identified as being at increased risk from COVID-19 are healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups. Emerging evidence suggests HCWs from ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of adverse COVID-19-related physical and mental health outcomes. To date there has been no large-scale analysis of these risks in UK healthcare workers or ancillary workers in healthcare settings, stratified by ethnicity or occupation type, and adjusted for potential confounders. This paper reports the protocol for a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study of UK HCWs, as part of the UK-REACH programme (The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers). Methods and analysis A baseline questionnaire with follow-up questionnaires at 4 and 8 months will be administered to a national cohort of UK healthcare workers and ancillary workers in healthcare settings, and those registered with UK healthcare regulators. With consent, data will be linked to health records, and participants followed up for 25 years. Univariate associations between ethnicity and primary outcome measures (clinical COVID-19 outcomes, and physical and mental health) and key confounders/explanatory variables will be tested, followed by multivariable analyses to test for associations between ethnicity and key outcomes adjusted for the confounder/explanatory variables, with interactions included as appropriate. Using follow-up data, multilevel models will be used to model changes over time by ethnic group, facilitating understanding of absolute and relative risks in different ethnic groups, and generalisability of findings. Ethics and dissemination. The study is approved by Health Research Authority (reference 20/HRA/4718), and carries minimal risk to participants. We aim to manage the small risk of participant distress due to being asked questions on sensitive topics by clearly indicating on the participant information sheet that the questionnaire covers sensitive topics and that participants are under no obligation to answer these, or indeed any other, questions, and by providing links to support organisations. Results will be disseminated with reports to Government and papers uploaded to pre-print servers and submitted to peer reviewed journals. Registration details.

32,Outcomes of Percutaneous Tracheostomy for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Failure,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory failure leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Data are just emerging about the practice and outcomes of tracheostomy in these patients. We reviewed our experience with tracheostomies for SARS-CoV-2 at our tertiary care, urban teaching hospital. Methods: We reviewed the demographics, comorbidities, timing of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay (LOS) in SARS-CoV-2 patients who received tracheostomies. Early tracheostomy was considered <14 days of ventilation. Medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated and compared with Wilcoxon rank sum, Spearman correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, and regression modeling. Results: From March 2020 to January 2021, our center had 370 patients intubated for SARS-CoV-2, and 59 (16%) had percutaneous bedside tracheostomy. Median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 19 (IQR 17 - 24) days. Demographics and comorbidities were similar between early and late tracheostomy, but early tracheostomy was associated with shorter ICU LOS and a trend towards shorter ventilation. To date, 34 (58%) of patients have been decannulated, 17 (29%) before hospital discharge; median time to decannulation was 24 (IQR 19-38) days. Decannulated patients were younger (56 vs 69 years), and in regression analysis, pneumothorax was associated was associated with lower decannulation rates (OR 0.05, 95CI 0.01 - 0.37). No providers developed symptoms or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: Tracheostomy is a safe and reasonable procedure for patients with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure. We feel that tracheostomy enhances care for SARS-CoV-2 since early tracheostomy appears associated with shorter duration of critical care, and decannulation rates appear high for survivors.",Jason M Arnold; Catherine A Gao; Elizabeth Malsin; Kristy Todd; A.

33,Comparison of the clinical characteristics and mortality in ARDS due to COVID-19 versus ARDS due to Influenza A-H1N1pdm09,"Abstract Importance: Infection with the SARS-Cov-2 and Influenza A-H1N1 viruses is responsible for the first pandemics of the 21st century. Both of these viruses can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The clinical differences and mortality associated with these two pandemic pneumonias in patients with ARDS are not well established Objective: To compare case-fatality between ARDS-Covid-19 and ARDS-Influenza A (H1N1), adjusting for known prognostic risk factors. Design, Setting and Participants: One hundred forty-seven patients with COVID-19 were compared with 94 with Influenza A-H1N1, all of these were admitted to the intensive care unit of the Referral Center for Respiratory Diseases and COVID-19 in Mexico City and fulfilled the criteria of ARDS. Results: Patients arrived at the hospital after 9 days of symptoms. Influenza patients had more obesity, more use of Norepinephrine, and higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase and glucose, and fewer platelets and lower PaO2/FIO2. Crude mortality was higher in COVID than in influenza (39% vs. 22%; p = 0.005). In a Cox proportional hazard model, patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 had a hazard ratio (HR) = 3.7; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.9-7.4, adjusted for age, gender, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, ventilatory ratio, and prone ventilation. In the fully adjusted model, the ventilatory ratio and the absence of prone-position ventilation were also predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) had a 3.7 times higher risk of death than similar patients with Influenza A-H1N1, after adjusting for SOFA score and other relevant risk factors for mortality.",CARMEN M HERNANDEZ CARDENAS; GUSTAVO LUGO GOYTIA; DIANA HERNANDEZ; Rogelio Perez-Padilla,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251306,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251306,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
34,Household secondary attack rate of COVID-19 by household size and index case characteristics,"In this population-wide study in Ontario, Canada, we investigated the household secondary attack rate (SAR) to understand its relationship to household size and index case characteristics. We identified all patients with confirmed COVID-19 between July 1 and November 30, 2020. Cases within households were matched based on reported residential address; households were grouped based on the number of household contacts. The majority of households (68.2%) had a SAR of 0%, while 3,442 (11.7%) households had a SAR [&ge;]75%. Overall household SAR was 19.5% and was similar across household sizes, but varied across index case characteristics. Households where index cases had longer delays between symptom onset and test seeking, households with older index cases, households with symptomatic index cases, and larger households located in diverse neighborhoods, were associated with greater household SAR. Our findings present characteristics associated with greater household SARs and proposes immediate testing as a method to reduce household transmission and incidence of COVID-19.",Semra Tibebu; Kevin A Brown; Nick Daneman; Lauren A Paul; Sarah A Buchan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252287,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252287,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
35,"A Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern, B.1.526, Identified in New York","Recent months have seen surges of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the globe along with considerable viral evolution. Extensive mutations in the spike protein of variants B.1.1.7, B1.351, and P.1 have raised concerns that the efficacy of current vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies could be threatened. In vitro studies have shown that one mutation, E484K, plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of some monoclonal antibodies as well as most convalescent and vaccinee sera against variant B.1.351. In fact, two vaccine trials have recently reported lower protective efficacy in South Africa, where B.1.351 is dominant. To survey for these novel variants in our patient population in New York City, PCR assays were designed to identify viruses with two signature mutations, E484K and N501Y. We observed a steady increase in the detection rate from late December to mid-February, with an alarming rise to 12.3% in the past two weeks. Whole genome sequencing further demonstrated that most of our E484K isolates (n=49/65) fell within a single lineage: NextStrain clade 20C or Pangolin lineage B.1.526. Patients with this novel variant came from diverse neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, and they were on average older and more frequently hospitalized. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences in the database further reveal that this B.1.526 variant is scattered in the Northeast of US, and its unique set of spike mutations may also pose an antigenic challenge for current interventions.",Medini K Annavajhala; Hiroshi Mohri; Jason E Zucker; Zizhang Sheng; Pengfei Wang; Angela Gomez-Simmonds; David D Ho; Anne-Catrin Uhlemann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252259,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252259,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
36,The differential impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states,"Medicaid expansion is a federally-funded program to expand health care access and coverage to economically challenged populations by increasing eligibility to Medicaid enrollment and investing in public health preventive services in the individual states. Yet, when the COVID-19 epidemic plagued the country, fourteen states were practicing their chosen decision not to enact the Medicaid expansion policy. We examined the consequences of this nationwide split in Medicaid design on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic between the expansion and non-expansion states. Our study shows that, on average, the expansion states had 217.56 fewer confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents than the non-expansion states [-210.41; 95%CI (-411.131) - (-2.05); P<0.05]. Also, the doubling time of COVID-19 cases in Medicaid expansion states was longer than that of non-expansion states by an average of 1.68 days [1.6826; 95%CI 0.4035-2.9617; P<0.05]. These findings suggest that proactive investment in public health preparedness was an effective protective policy measure in this crisis, unsurpassed by the benefits of COVID-19 emergency plans and funds. The study findings could be relevant to policymakers and healthcare strategists in non-expansion states considering their states' preparations for such public health crises.",Muhammad Ragaa Hussein; Islam Morsi; Engy A.

37,Evaluation of COVID-19 as a risk factor for maternal-fetal and neonatal complications: protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies.,"Background: COVID-19 in pregnant women has been suggested to impair maternal-fetal and neonatal outcomes. We then designed the present systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the repercussion of such disease over maternal fetal and neonatal mortality, need for intensive care, way of delivery, premature delivery, birth weight, Apgar score, presence of intrauterine growth restriction (IGR), and presence of amniotic fluid change. Methods: We will conduct a computerized search through MEDLINE/PubMed, LILACS/BIREME, Web of science, Biorxiv, Medrxiv, and Embase on July 23, 2020. We will include cohort and case-control studies fully reported comparing pregnant women with COVID-19 with those not affected by the disease for maternal fetal and neonatal mortality, need for intensive care, way of delivery, premature delivery occurrence, birth weight, Apgar scores, presence of intrauterine growth restriction, and presence of amniotic fluid change. Three doubles of reviewers will perform in duplicate and independently all steps on screening, risk of bias judgments, and data extraction with ability to discuss disagreements with supervising authors. Pooled effects will be estimated by both fixed and random-effects models and presented according to qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity assessment. Sensitivity analyses will be performed as well as a priori subgroup, meta-regression and multiple meta-regression analyses. We will also evaluate the risk of selective publication by assessing funnel plot asymmetry and the quality of the evidence by the application of the GRADE recommendations. Discussion: This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to assess the repercussion of COVID-19 in pregnant women over maternal-fetal and neonatal outcomes and to help clinicians and health systems improve such population outcomes throughout the current pandemic.

39,Vaccine Rollout Strategies: The Case for Vaccinating Essential Workers Early,"In planning for upcoming mass vaccinations against COVID-19, many jurisdictions have proposed using primarily age-based rollout strategies, where the oldest are vaccinated first and the youngest last. In the wake of growing evidence that approved vaccines are effective at preventing not only adverse outcomes, but also infection (and hence transmission of SARS-CoV-2), we propose that such age-based rollouts are both less equitable and less effective than strategies that prioritize essential workers. We demonstrate using modelling that strategies that target essential workers earlier consistently outperform those that do not, and that prioritizing essential workers provides a significant level of indirect protection for older adults. This conclusion holds across numerous outcomes, including cases, hospitalizations, deaths, prevalence of Long COVID, chronic impacts of COVID, quality adjusted life years lost and net monetary benefit lost. It also holds over a range of possible values for the efficacy of vaccination against infection. Our analysis focuses on regimes where the pandemic continues to be controlled with distancing and other measures as vaccination proceeds, and where the vaccination strategy is expected to last for over the coming 6-8 months - for example British Columbia, Canada. In such a setting with a total population of 5M, vaccinating essential workers sooner is expected to prevent over 200,000 infections, over 600 deaths, and to produce a net monetary benefit of over $500M. 20-25% of the quality adjusted life years lost, and 28-34% of the net monetary benefit lost, are due to chronic impacts of COVID-19.",Nicola Mulberry; Paul F Tupper; Christopher MacCabe; Erin Kirwin; Caroline Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252309,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252309,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
40,Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Scenes by 'Zero-Shot' Enhancements of Electron Microscopy Images,"Electron microscopy (EM) recordings of infected tissues serve to diagnose a disease, and they can contribute to our understanding of infection processes. Consequently, a large number of EM images of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with cells have been made available by numerous labs. However, due to EM recording techniques at high resolution, images of infection scenes are very noisy and they appear two dimensional ('flat'). Current research consequently aims (A) at methods that can remove noise, and (B) at techniques that allow for recovering a 3D impression of the virus or its parts. Here we discuss a novel method which can recover a spatial impression of a whole infection scene at high resolution. In contrast to previous approaches which aim at the reconstruction of single spike proteins or a single virus, the here used method can be applied to a single noisy EM image of an infection scene. As one example image, we show a high resolution image of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero cell cultures (Fig. 1). The method we use is based on probabilistic machine learning algorithms which can operate in a 'zero-shot' setting, i.e., in a setting when just one noisy image (and no large and clean image corpus) is available. The probabilistic method we apply can estimate non-noisy images by inferring first order statistics (pixel means) across image patches using a previously learned probabilistic image representation. Estimating higher order statistics and appropriately chosen probabilistic models then allow for the generation of images that enhance details and give a spatial impression of a full nanoscopic scene.",Jakob Drefs; Sebastian Salwig; Jörg Lücke,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432265,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432265,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,False
41,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 nsp1-5'-UTR complex via the extended ensemble simulations,"Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a 180-residue protein that blocks the translation of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Although it has been known that SARS-CoV-2's own RNA evades an nsp1's host translation shutoff, its molecular mechanism has been poorly understood. We performed an extended ensemble molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the mechanism of viral RNA evasion. Simulation results showed that the stem loop structure of SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5'-untranslated region is recognized by both nsp1's globular region and intrinsically disordered region. The recognition presumably enables selectively translating the viral RNAs. A cluster analysis of the binding mode and a detailed analysis of the binding poses were performed, and we identified a few important residues involved in the SL1 recognition mechanism. The simulation results implied that nsp1 C-terminal helices are lifted from the 40S ribosome upon the binding of SL1 to the nsp1, reenabling the translation blocked by the C-terminal helices.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432807,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432807,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,False

43,Transposable elements as sensors of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Transposable elements (TEs) are induced in response to viral infections. TEs induction triggers a robust and durable interferon (IFN) response, providing a host defense mechanism. Still, the connection between SARS-CoV-2 IFN response and TEs remained unexplored. Here, we analyzed TE expression changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in different human cellular models. We find that compared to other viruses, which cause global upregulation of TEs, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a significantly milder TE response in both primary lung epithelial cells and in iPSC-derived lung alveolar type 2 cells. In general, we observe that TE activation correlates with, and precedes, the induction of IFN-related genes, suggesting that the failure to activate TEs may be the reason for the weak IFN response. Moreover, we identify two variables which explain most of the observed diverseness in immune responses: basal expression levels of TEs in the pre-infected cell, and the viral load. Since basal TE levels increase with age, we propose that ""TE desensitization"" leads to age-related death from COVID19. This work provides a potential mechanistic explanation for SARS-CoV-2s success in its fight against the host immune system, and suggests that TEs could be used as sensors or serve as potential drug targets for COVID-19.",Matan Sorek; Eran Meshorer; Sharon Schlesinger,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432821,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432821,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,False
44,Comparison of the pathogenicity and virus shedding of SARS CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 and D614G variant in hamster model,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has posed a serious challenge to public health system and vaccination programs across the globe. We have studied the pathogenicity and virus shedding pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 and compared with D614G variant in Syrian hamsters. VOC 202012/01 could produce disease in hamsters characterized by body weight loss and respiratory tract tropism but mild lung pathology. Further, we also documented that neutralizing antibodies developed against VOC 202012/01 could equally neutralize D614G variant. Higher load of VOC 202012/01 in the nasal wash specimens was observed during the first week of infection outcompeting the D614G variant. The findings suggest increased fitness of VOC 202012/01 to the upper respiratory tract which could lead to higher transmission. Further investigations are needed to understand the transmissibility of new variants.",Sreelekshmy Mohandas; Pragya D Yadav; Dimpal Nyayanit; Gururaj Deshpande; Anita Shete Aich; Gajanan Sapkal; Sanjay Kumar; Rajlaxmi Jain; Manoj Kadam; Abhimanyu Kumar; Deepak Y Patil; Prasad Sarkale; Pranita Gawande; Priya Abraham,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432136,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432136,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,False
45,A single-cell and spatial atlas of autopsy tissues reveals pathology and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 1 million deaths globally, mostly due to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, or direct complications resulting in multiple-organ failures. Little is known about the host tissue immune and cellular responses associated with COVID-19 infection, symptoms, and lethality. To address this, we collected tissues from 11 organs during the clinical autopsy of 17 individuals who succumbed to COVID-19, resulting in a tissue bank of approximately 420 specimens. We generated comprehensive cellular maps capturing COVID-19 biology related to patients demise through single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq of lung, kidney, liver and heart tissues, and further contextualized our findings through spatial RNA profiling of distinct lung regions. We developed a computational framework that incorporates removal of ambient RNA and automated cell type annotation to facilitate comparison with other healthy and diseased tissue atlases. In the lung, we uncovered significantly altered transcriptional programs within the epithelial, immune, and stromal compartments and cell intrinsic changes in multiple cell types relative to lung tissue from healthy controls. We observed evidence of: alveolar type 2 (AT2) differentiation replacing depleted alveolar type 1 (AT1) lung epithelial cells, as previously seen in fibrosis; a concomitant increase in myofibroblasts reflective of defective tissue repair; and, putative TP63+ intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor (IPBLP) cells, similar to cells identified in H1N1 influenza, that may serve as an emergency cellular reserve for severely damaged alveoli. Together, these findings suggest the activation and failure of multiple avenues for regeneration of the epithelium in these terminal lungs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA reads were enriched in lung mononuclear phagocytic cells and endothelial cells, and these cells expressed distinct host response transcriptional programs. We corroborated the compositional and transcriptional changes in lung tissue through spatial analysis of RNA profiles in situ and distinguished unique tissue host responses between regions with and without viral RNA, and in COVID-19 donor tissues relative to healthy lung. Finally, we analyzed genetic regions implicated in COVID-19 GWAS with transcriptomic data to implicate specific cell types and genes associated with disease severity. Overall, our COVID-19 cell atlas is a foundational dataset to better understand the biological impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the human body and empowers the identification of new therapeutic interventions and prevention strategies.",Toni M.

46,Pyroptosis of syncytia formed by fusion of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 expressing cells,"SARS-Cov-2 infected cells fused with the ACE2-positive neighboring cells forming syncytia. However, the effect of syncytia in disease development is largely unknown. We established an in vitro cell-cell fusion system and used it to mimic the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with ACE2-expressing cells to form syncytia. We found that Caspase-9 was activated after syncytia formation, and Caspase-3/7 was activated downstream of Caspase-9, but it triggered GSDME-dependent pyroptosis rather than apoptosis. What is more, single cell RNA-sequencing data showed that both ACE2 and GSDME were expression in alveolar type 2 cells in human lung. We propose that pyroptosis is the fate of syncytia formed by SARS-CoV-2 infected host cells and ACE2-positive cells, which indicated that lytic death of syncytia may contribute to the excessive inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients.",Huabin Ma; Zhoujie Zhu; Huaipeng Lin; Shanshan Wang; Peipei Zhang; Yanguo Li; Long Li; Jinling Wang; Yufen Zhao; Jiahuai Han,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432853,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432853,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,False
47,The type 2 asthma mediator IL-13 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of bronchial epithelium,"Rationale: Asthma is associated with chronic changes in the airway epithelium, a key target of SARS-CoV-2. Many epithelial changes are driven by the type 2 cytokine IL-13, but the effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown. Objectives: We sought to discover how IL-13 and other cytokines affect expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2-associated host proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and determine whether IL-13 stimulation alters susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We used bulk and single cell RNA-seq to identify cytokine-induced changes in SARS-CoV-2-associated gene expression in HBECs. We related these to gene expression changes in airway epithelium from individuals with mild-moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We analyzed effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs. Measurements and Main Results: Transcripts encoding 332 of 342 (97%) SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins were detected in HBECs ([&ge;]1 RPM in 50% samples). 41 (12%) of these mRNAs were regulated by IL-13 (>1.5-fold change, FDR < 0.05). Many IL-13-regulated SARS-CoV-2-associated genes were also altered in type 2 high asthma and COPD. IL-13 pretreatment reduced viral RNA recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and decreased dsRNA, a marker of viral replication, to below the limit of detection in our assay. Mucus also inhibited viral infection. Conclusions: IL-13 markedly reduces susceptibility of HBECs to SARS-CoV-2 infection through mechanisms that likely differ from those activated by type I interferons. Our findings may help explain reports of relatively low prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and could lead to new strategies for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Luke R Bonser; Walter L Eckalbar; Lauren Rodriguez; Jiangshan Shen; Kyung Duk Koh; Lorna T Zlock; Stephanie Christenson; Prescott G Woodruff; Walter E Finkbeiner; David J Erle,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432762,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.432762,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,False
48,Non-pharmaceutical interventions and inoculation rate shape SARS-COV-2 vaccination campaign success,"Nearly one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the first SARS-COV-2 vaccines received emergency use authorization and vaccination campaigns began. A number of factors can reduce the averted burden of cases and deaths due to vaccination. Here, we use a dynamic model, parametrized with Bayesian inference methods, to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and vaccine administration and uptake rates on infections and deaths averted in the United States. We estimate that high compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions could avert more than 60% of infections and 70% of deaths during the period of vaccine administration, and that increasing the vaccination rate from 5 to 11 million people per week could increase the averted burden by more than one third. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions and increasing vaccine administration rates.",Marta Galanti; Sen Pei; Teresa K Yamana; Frederick J Angulo; Apostolos Charos; Farid Khan; Kimberly Shea; David Swerdlow; Jeffrey Shaman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252240,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252240,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
49,"Health impact and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in Sindh Province, Pakistan","Background Multiple COVID-19 vaccines appear to be safe and efficacious, but only high-income countries have the resources to procure sufficient vaccine doses for most of their eligible populations. The World Health Organization has published guidelines for vaccine prioritisation, but most vaccine impact projections have focused on high-income countries, and few incorporate economic considerations. To address this evidence gap, we projected the health and economic impact of different vaccination scenarios in Sindh province, Pakistan (population: 48 million). Methods We fitted a compartmental transmission model to COVID-19 cases and deaths in Sindh from 30 April to 15 September 2020 using varying assumptions about the timing of the first case and the duration of infection-induced immunity. We then projected cases and deaths over 10 years under different vaccine scenarios. Finally, we combined these projections with a detailed economic model to estimate incremental costs (from healthcare and partial societal perspectives), disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and cost-effectiveness for each scenario. Findings A one-year vaccination campaign using an infection-blocking vaccine at $3/dose with 70% efficacy and 2.5 year duration of protection is projected to avert around 0.93 (95% Credible Interval: 0.91, 1.0) million cases, 7.3 (95% CrI: 7.2, 7.4) thousand deaths and 85.1 (95% CrI: 84.6, 86.8) thousand DALYs, and be net cost saving from the health system perspective. However, paying a high price for vaccination ($10/dose) may not be cost-effective. Vaccinating the older (65+) population first would prevent slightly more deaths and a similar number of cases as vaccinating everyone aged 15+ at the same time, at similar cost-effectiveness. Interpretation COVID-19 vaccination can have a considerable health impact, and is likely to be cost-effective if more optimistic vaccine scenarios apply. Preventing severe disease is an important contributor to this impact, but the advantage of focusing initially on older, high-risk populations may be smaller in generally younger populations where many people have already been infected, typical of many low- and -middle income countries, as long as vaccination gives good protection against infection as well as disease.",Carl Andrew Pearson; Fiammetta Bozzani; Simon R Procter; Nicholas G Davies; Maryam Huda; Henning Tarp Jensen; Marcus Keogh-Brown; Muhammad Khalid; Sedona Sweeney; Sergio Torres-Rueda; - CHiL COVID-19 Working Group; - CMMID COVID-19 Working Group; Rosalind M Eggo; Anna Vassall; Mark Jit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252338,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252338,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
50,Evaluation of a surrogate virus neutralization test for high-throughput serosurveillance of SARS-CoV-2,"High-throughput serological tests that can detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are desirable for serosurveillance and vaccine efficacy evaluation. Although the conventional neutralization test (cVNT) remains the gold standard to confirm the presence of neutralizing antibodies in sera, the test is too labour-intensive for massive screening programs and less reproducible as live virus and cell culture is involved. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of a commercially available surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT, GenScript cPass) that can be done without biosafety level 3 containment in less than 2 hours. When using the cVNT and a Luminex multiplex immunoassay (MIA) as reference, the sVNT obtained a sensitivity of 94% (CI 90-96%) on a panel of 317 immune sera that were obtained from hospitalized and mild COVID-19 cases from Belgium and a sensitivity of 89% (CI 81-93%) on a panel of 184 healthcare workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo. We also found strong antibody titer correlations (rs>0.8) among the different techniques used. In conclusion, our evaluation suggests that the sVNT could be a powerful tool to monitor/detect neutralising antibodies in cohort and population studies. The technique could be especially useful for vaccine evaluation studies in sub-Saharan Africa where the basic infrastructure to perform cVNTs is lacking.",joachim Marien; Johan Michiels; Leo Heyndrickx; Antoine Nkuba-Ndaye; Ann Ceulemans; Koen Koen Bartholomeeusen; Joule Madinga; Placide Mbala-Kingebeni; Veerle Vanlerberghe; Steve Ahuka-Mundeke; Linfa Wang; Kevin K.

51,A prospective evaluation of the analytical performance of GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE(R) FLU A/B,"Background: Molecular tests are the mainstay for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, their accessibility can be limited by the long examination time and inability to evaluate multiple samples at once. This study evaluated the analytical performance of the newly developed rapid molecular assays GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the GENECUBE(R) FLU A/B. Method: This prospective study was conducted between December 14, 2020, and January 9, 2021, at a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) center. Samples were collected from the nasopharynx with flocked swabs. Molecular tests were performed with the GENECUBE(R) system and reference reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the results of the two assays were compared. Result: Among 1065 samples, 81 (7.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the reference RT-PCR. Three showed discordance between GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the reference RT-PCR; the total, positive and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.7%, 100%, and 99.7%, respectively. All discordant cases were positive for GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and negative for the reference RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was detected from all three samples by another molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2. For the GENECUBE(R) FLU A/B, the total, positive and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.5%, 100%, and 99.1%.

52,Genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders and risk of COVID-19,"Background Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders have been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, e.g. to what extent genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders contributes to the observed association. Methods The analytic sample consisted of white British participants of UK Biobank registered in England, with available genetic data, and alive on Jan 31, 2020 (i.e., the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK) (n=346,554). We assessed individuals' genetic predisposition to different psychiatric disorders, including substance misuse, depression, anxiety, and psychotic disorder, using polygenic risk score (PRS). Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were identified through the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. We performed a GWAS analysis for each psychiatric disorder in a randomly selected half of the study population who were free of COVID-19 (i.e., the base dataset). For the other half (i.e., the target dataset), PRS was calculated for each psychiatric disorder using the discovered genetic variants from the base dataset. We then examined the association between PRS of each psychiatric disorder and risk of COVID-19, or severe COVID-19 (i.e., hospitalization and death), using logistic regression models. The ascertainment of COVID-19 was through the Public Health England dataset, the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data and death registers, updated until July 26, 2020. For validation, we repeated the PRS analyses based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Results 155,988 participants (including 1,451 COVID-19 cases), with a mean age of 68.50 years at COVID-19 outbreak, were included for PRS analysis. Higher genetic liability forwards psychiatric disorders was associated with increased risk of both any COVID-19 and severe COVID-19, especially genetic risk for substance misuse and depression. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for any COVID-19 were 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.31) and 1.26 (1.11-1.42) among individuals with a high genetic risk (above the upper tertile of PRS) for substance misuse and depression, respectively, compared with individuals with a low genetic risk (below the lower tertile). Largely similar ORs were noted for severe COVID-19 and similar albeit slightly lower estimates using PRSs generated from GWAS summary statistics from independent samples. Conclusion In the UK Biobank, genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, including severe course of the disease. These findings suggest the potential role of genetic factors in the observed phenotypic association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19, underscoring the need of increased medical surveillance of for this vulnerable population during the pandemic.",Wenwen Chen; Yu Zeng; Chen Suo; Huazhen Yang; Yilong Chen; Can Hou; Yao Hu; Zhiye Ying; Yajing Sun; Yuanyuan Qu; Donghao Lu; Fang Fang; Unnur A.

In this paper, we analyze a mental health related dataset from the US to enhance our understanding of human reactions to the pandemic. We are particularly interested in providing quantitative characterization of the pandemic impact on the public mental health, on top of qualitative explorations. We employ the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) method to deal with missing values and take the logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method to identify risk factors for mental health. The analyses are conducted to a large scale of online survey data from 12 consecutive weeks, so that the longitudinal trend of the risk factors can be investigated.

55,Effect of in-hospital treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on mortality and complications in patients hospitalized for COVID-19: a large Spanish cohort study.,"Background: The use of ACEI (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor) and ARB (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker) in patients with COVID-19 remains controversial, as the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System seems to have a relevant role in this disease. Our main aim was to describe the effect of ACEI/ARB treatment during COVID-19 hospitalization on mortality and complications and assess the incidence of MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events). Methods and findings: This work, part of the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, is a retrospective, observational, multicenter study comparing patients with COVID-19 treated with ACEI/ARB during hospitalization to those not treated. The primary endpoint was incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis (IMV [Invasive Mechanical Ventilation], NIMV [Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation], ICU admission [Intensive Care Unit], and/or all-cause mortality). The secondary endpoint was incidence of MACE. We evaluated both outcomes in patients whose treatment with ACEI/ARB continued or was withdrawn during hospitalization. Between February and June 2020, 11,205 patients were included. The mean age was 67 years (SD=16.3) and 43.1% were female; 2,162 patients received ACEI/ARB treatment and 9,043 did not. ACEI/ARB treatment showed a protective effect on all-cause mortality (p<.0001), but was only protective in hypertensive patients in terms of IMV, ICU admission, and the composite outcome of prognosis (p<.0001 for all). No differences were found in incidence of MACE. Patients previously treated with ACEI/ARB who continued treatment during hospitalization had a lower incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis compared to those whose treatment was withdrawn (RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.63-0.76). ARB had a more beneficial effect on survival than ACEI (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.96). The main study limitations include its retrospective, observational nature; the fact that treatment decisions were made by individual clinicians; and that treatment duration was not recorded. Conclusion: ACEI/ARB treatment during COVID-19 hospitalization was not shown to be harmful and indeed had a protective effect on mortality. The benefits were greater in hypertensive patients, those who continued treatment during hospitalization, and those taking ARB.",Emilia Roy-Vallejo; Aquilino Sanchez Purificacion; Jose David Torres Pena; Beatriz Sanchez Moreno; Francisco Arnalich; Maria Jose Garcia Blanco; Jose Lopez Miranda; Juan Luis Romero Cabrera; Carmen Rosario Herrero Gil; Jose Bascunana; Manuel Rubio Rivas; Sara Pintos Otero; Veronica Martinez Sempere; Jesus Ballano Rodriguez-Solis; Ricardo Gil Sanchez; Jairo Luque del Pino; Amara Gonzalez Noya; Maria Sierra Navas Alcantara; Begona Cortes Rodriguez; Jose N Alcala; Ana Suarez Lombrana; Jorge Andres Soler; Ricardo Gomez Huelgas; Jose Manuel Casas Rojo; Jesus Millan Nunez-Cortes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252391,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252391,2021-02-25,2021-02-25,,True
56,"Misinformation, Perceptions Towards COVID-19 and Willingness to be Vaccinated: A Population-Based Survey in Yemen","Background Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, many pharmaceutical companies were racing to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Simultaneously, rumors and misinformation about COVID-19 were and still widely spreading. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation among the Yemeni population and its association with vaccine acceptance and perceptions. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in four major cities in Yemen. The constructed questionnaire consisted of four main sections (sociodemographic data, misinformation, perceptions (perceived susceptibility, severity and worry), and vaccination acceptance evaluation). Subject recruitment and data collection were conducted online utilizing social websites and using the snowball sampling technique. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using SPSS version 27. Results The total number of respondents was 484. Over 60% of them were male and had a university education, more than half had less than 100$ monthly income and were Khat chewers, while only 18% were smokers. Misinformation prevalence ranged from 8.9% to 38.9%, depending on the statement being asked.  Men, university education, higher income, employment, and living in urban areas were associated with a lower misinformation level ( p  <0.05). Statistically significant association ( p  <0.05) between university education, living in urban areas, and being employed with perceived susceptibility were observed. The acceptance rate was 61.2% for free vaccines, but it decreased to 43% if they had to purchase it. Females, respondents with lower monthly income, and those who believed that pharmaceutical companies made the virus for financial gains were more likely to reject the vaccination ( p  <0.05). Conclusion The study revealed that the acceptance rate to take a vaccine was suboptimal and significantly affected by gender, misinformation, cost, and income. Furthermore, being female, Non-university educated, low-income, and living in rural areas were associated with higher susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19 . These findings show a clear link between misinformation susceptibility and willingness to vaccinate.

57,"Stratified Random Sampling Methodology for Observing Community Mask Use within Indoor Settings: Results from Louisville, Kentucky during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Wearing a facial mask can limit COVID-19 transmission. Measurements of communities mask use behavior have mostly relied on self-report. This studys objective was to devise a method for measuring the prevalence of mask-wearing and proper mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14-20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The average mask use prevalence among observed visitors of the 382 visited public areas was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 17% of the public areas, at least one unmasked visitor was among the observed visitors; in 48%, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed. The average mask use among staff was 92%, but unmasked staff were observed in fewer public areas, as an unmasked staff member was observed in 11% of the visited public areas. The average prevalence of proper make use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33. Significant disparities in mask use and its proper use were observed among both visitors and staff by public area size, retail trade type, and geographical area. Observing unmasked and incorrectly masked visitors was more common in small (less than 1500 square feet) public areas than larger ones, also in food and grocery stores than other retail stores.

58,Inequalities in the decline and recovery of pathological cancer diagnoses during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based study,"BackgroundThe restructuring of healthcare systems to cope with the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in clinical services such as cancer screening and diagnostics.

MethodsData from the four Northern Ireland pathology labs was used to assess trends in pathological cancer diagnoses from 1st March to 12th September 2020 overall and by cancer site, gender and age. These trends were compared to the same timeframe from 2017-2019.

ResultsBetween 1st March and 12th September 2020 there was a 23% reduction in cancer diagnoses compared to the same time period in the preceding three years. Although some recovery occurred in August and September 2020, this revealed inequalities across certain patient groups. Pathological diagnoses of lung, prostate and gynaecological malignancies remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Males and younger/middle-aged adults, particularly the 50-59 year old patient group, also lagged behind other population demographic groups in terms of returning to expected numbers of pathological cancer diagnoses.

ConclusionsThere is a critical need to protect cancer diagnostic services in the ongoing pandemic to facilitate timely investigation of potential cancer cases. Targeted public health campaigns may be needed to reduce emerging inequalities in cancer diagnoses as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.",Ashleigh C. Hamilton; David W. Donnelly; Maurice B.

59,SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance identifies naturally occurring truncations of ORF7a that limit immune suppression,"Over 200,000 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been determined for viruses isolated from around the world. These sequences have been critical for understanding the spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Using global phylogenomics, we show that mutations frequently occur in the C-terminal end of ORF7a. We have isolated one of these mutant viruses from a patient sample and used viral chal-lenge experiments to demonstrate that {Delta}115 mutation results in a growth defect. ORF7a has been implicated in immune modulation, and we show that the C-terminal truncation results in distinct changes in interferon stimulated gene expression. Collectively, this work indicates that ORF7a mutations occur frequently and that these changes affect viral mechanisms responsible for suppressing the immune response.

60,Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns,"ObjectiveMeasure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern.

DesignModelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers.

SettingThe UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresReduction in real-time reproduction number Rt.

ResultsNationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9 - 1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86 - 1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality.

ConclusionsThe relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIFirst study to measure effects of UK Tier system for SARS-CoV-2 control at national and regional level.

61,An integrated framework for building trustworthy data-driven epidemiological models: Application to the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City,"Epidemiological models can provide the dynamic evolution of a pandemic but they are based on many assumptions and parameters that have to be adjusted over the time when the pandemic lasts. However, often the available data are not sufficient to identify the model parameters and hence infer the unobserved dynamics. Here, we develop a general framework for building a trustworthy data-driven epidemiological model, consisting of a workflow that integrates data acquisition and event timeline, model development, identifiability analysis, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model robustness analysis, and forecasting with uncertainties in different scenarios. In particular, we apply this framework to propose a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, including new compartments and model vaccination in order to forecast the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). We find that we can uniquely estimate the model parameters and accurately predict the daily new infection cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, in agreement with the available data from NYCs governments website. In addition, we employ the calibrated data-driven model to study the effects of vaccination and timing of reopening indoor dining in NYC.",Sheng Zhang; Joan Ponce; Zhen Zhang; Guang Lin; George Em Karniadakis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252255,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252255,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,True
62,Depression and anxiety before and during the COVID-19 lockdown: a longitudinal cohort study with university students,"BackgroundFor young people, just as in the general population, COVID-19 caused many changes in their lives, including an increased risk for mental illness symptoms. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in anxiety and depression symptoms in a cohort of university students.

MethodsThis study is part of broader longitudinal research on university students mental health with data of the Portuguese version of The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Portuguese version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) with evaluations on January, May and October 2019 and June 2020, as well as socio-demographic information.

Results341 university students (257 females and 84 males) were included, with a mean age of 19.91 (SD=1.58). In June 2020, the mean for perceived wellbeing loss was 60.47% (SD=26.56) and 59.54% (SD=28.95) for mental health loss. The proportion of students with scores equal to or above 15 in the PHQ-9 ranged between 22.6% and 25.5% in 2019 and 37.0% in June 2020. The proportion of GAD-7 scores above cut-off ten ranged between 46.0% and 47.8% in 2019 and 64.5% in 2020. Compared with preceding trends, PHQ-9 scores were 3.11 (CI=2.40-3.83) higher than expected, and GAD-7 scores were 3.56 (CI=2.75-5.37) higher.

63,A longitudinal study of healthcare workers' surveillance during the ongoing COVID-19 Epidemics in Italy: is SARS-CoV-2 still a threat for the Health-care System?,"ObjectivesIn spring 2020, Northern Italy was the first area outside China to be involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This observational study depicts SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and serological curves among first-line healthcare workers (HCWs) at Padua University Hospital (PdUH), North-East Italy.

Method344 HCWs, working at the PdUH Emergency Department and Infectious Disease Unit, underwent a SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab with paired IgM and IgG antibody detection for 4 consecutive weeks. At every session, a questionnaire recorded symptoms, signs and recent contacts with SARS-CoV-2 patients. Positive cases were followed up for 5 months.

ResultsTwenty-seven HCWs (7.84%) had positive serology (Abs) with 12 positive swabs during the study period. Two additional HCWs were positive by swab but without Abs. Fourteen cases (4%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection before the beginning of the study. An HCW with autoimmune disease showed false Ab results. 46% of individuals with Abs reported no symptoms, in accordance with previous population studies. Fever, nasal congestion, diarrhoea and contacts with SARS-CoV-2 individuals correlated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 96% of Abs+ cases showed persistent positive antibodies 5 months later and none was re-infected.

DiscussionCorrect use of PPEs and separate paths for positive/negative patients in the hospital can result in a low percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs, even in high risk settings. Frequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs is worthwhile, irrespective of HCWs symptoms, due to the lack of specificity together with the high percentage of asymptomatic cases.

64,Microbial signatures in the lower airways of mechanically ventilated COVID19 patients associated with poor clinical outcome,"Mortality among patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure is high and there are no known lower airway biomarkers that predict clinical outcome. We investigated whether bacterial respiratory infections and viral load were associated with poor clinical outcome and host immune tone. We obtained bacterial and fungal culture data from 589 critically ill subjects with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. On a subset of the subjects that underwent bronchoscopy, we also quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, analyzed the microbiome of the lower airways by metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses and profiled the host immune response. We found that isolation of a hospital-acquired respiratory pathogen was not associated with fatal outcome. However, poor clinical outcome was associated with enrichment of the lower airway microbiota with an oral commensal (Mycoplasma salivarium), while high SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, poor anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, together with a unique host transcriptome profile of the lower airways were most predictive of mortality. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that 1) the extent of viral infectivity drives mortality in severe COVID-19, and therefore 2) clinical management strategies targeting viral replication and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 should be prioritized.",Imran Sulaiman; Matthew Chung; Luis Angel; Jun-Chieh J.

65,Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine in Pakistan Among Health Care Workers,"ObjectiveAcceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine will impart a pivotal role in eradicating the virus. In Pakistan, health care workers (HCWs) are the first group to receive vaccination. This survey aimed at the level of acceptance to the COVID-19 vaccine and predictors of non-acceptance in HCWs.

MethodThis was a cross-sectional study design and data were collected through 3rd December 2020 and February 14th, 2021. An English questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms and administration of affiliate hospitals along with snowball sampling for private hospitals.

ResultsOut of 5,237 responses, 3,679 (70.25%) accepted COVID-19 vaccination and 1,284 (24.51%) wanted to delay until more data was available. Only 0.05% of HCWs rejected being vaccinated. Vaccine acceptance was more in young (76%) and female gender (63.3%) who worked in a tertiary care hospital (51.2%) and were direct patient care providers (61.3%). The reason for rejection in females was doubtful vaccine effectiveness (31.48%) while males rejected due to prior COVID-19 exposure (42.19%) and side effect profile of the vaccine (33.17%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated age between 51-60 years, female gender, Pashtuns, those working in the specialty of medicine and allied, taking direct care of COVID-19 patients, higher education, and prior OCVID-19 infection as the predictors for acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vaccine.

66,Evidence of long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 even in elderly COVID-19 convalescents showing a mild to moderate disease progression,"After the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in China in late 2019, a pandemic evolved that has claimed millions of lives so far. While about 80 % of infections cause mild or moderate COVID-19 disease, some individuals show a severe progression or even die. Most countries are far from achieving herd-immunity, however, the first approved vaccines offer hope for containment of the virus. Although much is known about the virus, there is a lack of information on the immunity of convalescent individuals.

We here evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in 41 COVID-19 convalescents. As previous studies mostly included younger individuals, one advantage of our study is the comparatively high mean age of the convalescents included in the cohort considered (54 {+/-} 8.4 years). While anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were still detectable in 95 % of convalescents up to 8 months post infection, an antibody-decay over time was generally observed in most donors. Using a multiplex assay, our data additionally reveal that most convalescents exhibit a broad humoral immunity against different viral epitopes. We demonstrate by flow cytometry that convalescent donors show a significantly elevated number of natural killer cells when compared to healthy controls, while no differences were found concerning other leucocyte subpopulations. We detected a specific long-lasting cellular immune response in convalescents by stimulating immune cells with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides, covering domains of the viral spike, membrane and nucleocapsid protein, and measuring interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) release thereafter. We modified a commercially available ELISA assay for IFN-{gamma} determination in whole-blood specimens of COVID-19 convalescents. One advantage of this assay is that it does not require special equipment and can, thus, be performed in any standard laboratory. In conclusion, our study adds knowledge regarding the persistence of immunity of convalescents suffering from mild to moderate COVID-19. Moreover, our study provides a set of simple methods to characterize and confirm experienced COVID-19.",Bastian Fischer; Christopher Lindenkamp; Christoph Lichtenberg; Ingvild Edda Birschmann; Cornelius Knabbe; Doris Hendig,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21251891,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21251891,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,True
67,SARS CoV-2 escape variants exhibit differential infectivity and neutralization sensitivity to convalescent or post-vaccination sera,"Towards eradicating COVID19, developing vaccines that induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies is a main goal. As counter measurements, viral escape mutants rapidly emerge and potentially compromise vaccine efficiency. Herein we monitored ability of convalescent or Pfizer-BTN162b2 post-vaccination sera to neutralize wide-type SARS-CoV2 or its UK-B.1.1.7 and SA-B.1.351 variants. Relative to convalescent sera, post-vaccination sera exhibited higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against wild-type or mutated viruses. However, while SARS-CoV2 wild-type and UK-N501Y were similarly neutralized by tested sera, the SA-N501Y/K417N/E484K variant moderately escaped neutralization. Significant contribution to infectivity and sensitivity to neutralization was attributed to each of the variants and their single or combined mutations, highlighting alternative mechanisms by which prevalent variants with either N501Y or E484K/K417N mutations spread. Our study validates the clinical significance of currently administered vaccines, but emphasizes that their efficacy may be compromised by circulated variants, urging the development of new ones with broader neutralization functions.",Alona Kuzmina; Yara Khalaila; Olga Voloshin; Ayelet Keren-Naus; Liora Bohehm; Yael Raviv; Yonat Shemer-Avni; Elli Rosenberg; Ran Taube,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252002,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252002,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,True

Given these functional data, we explore the modes of variation in the data using functional principal component analysis (FPCA). We also apply functional clustering analysis to identify patterns of COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories across the US. Moreover, we quantify the associations between Google COVID-19 search trends for symptoms and COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories using dynamic correlation. Finally, we examine the dynamics of correlations for the top nine Google search trends of symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories. Our results reveal and characterize distinct patterns for COVID-19 spread and mortality across the US. The dynamics of these correlations suggest the feasibility of using Google queries to forecast COVID-19 cases and mortality for up to three weeks in advance.

69,Prior COVID-19 Infection and Antibody Response to Single Versus Double Dose mRNA SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination,"The double dose regimen for mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 presents both a hope and a challenge for global efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. With supply chain logistics impacting the rollout of population-scale vaccination programs, increasing attention has turned to the potential efficacy of single versus double dose vaccine administration for select individuals. To this end, we examined response to Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine in a large cohort of healthcare workers including those with versus without prior COVID-19 infection. For all participants, we quantified circulating levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike (S) protein IgG at baseline prior to vaccine, after vaccine dose 1, and after vaccine dose 2. We observed that the anti-S IgG antibody response following a single vaccine dose in persons who had recovered from confirmed prior COVID-19 infection was similar to the antibody response following two doses of vaccine in persons without prior infection (P[&ge;]0.58). Patterns were similar for the post-vaccine symptoms experienced by infection recovered persons following their first dose compared to the symptoms experienced by infection naive persons following their second dose (P=0.66). These results support the premise that a single dose of mRNA vaccine could provoke in COVID-19 recovered individuals a level of immunity that is comparable to that seen in infection naive persons following a double dose regimen. Additional studies are needed to validate our findings, which could allow for public health programs to expand the reach of population wide vaccination efforts.",Joseph E.

70,COVID-19 in New York state: Effects of demographics and air quality on infection and fatality,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a global impact that has been unevenly distributed amongst and, even within countries. Multiple demographic and environmental factors have been associated with the risk of COVID-19 spread and fatality, including age, gender, ethnicity, poverty, and air quality among others. However, specific contributions of these factors are yet to be understood. Here, we attempted to explain the variability in infection, death, and fatality rates by understanding the contributions of a few selected factors. We compared the incidence of COVID-19 in New York State (NYS) counties during the first wave of infection and analyzed how different demographic and environmental variables associate with the variation observed across the counties. We observed that the two important COVID-19 metrics of infection rates and death rates to be well correlated, and both metrics being highest in counties located near New York City, considered one of the epicenters of the infection in the US. In contrast, disease fatality was found to be highest in a different set of counties despite registering a low infection rate. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we divided the counties into three clusters based on COVID-19 infection, death rate, or fatality, and compared the differences in the demographic and environmental variables such as ethnicity, age, population density, poverty, temperature, and air quality in each of these clusters. Furthermore, a regression model built on this data reveals PM2.5 and distance from the epicenter are significant risk factors for high infection rate, while disease fatality has a strong association with age and PM2.5. Our results demonstrate, for the NYS, distinct contributions of old age, PM2.5, ethnicity these factors to the overall COVID-19 burden and highlight the detrimental impact of poor air quality. These results could help design and direct location-specific control and mitigation strategies.",Sumona Mondal; Chaya Chaipitakporn; Vijay Kumar; Bridget Wangler; Supraja Gurajala; Suresh Dhaniyala; Shantanu Sur,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252262,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252262,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,True

We use a comparative tabular format to examine differences in mortality, economic impact and equity between regions with mandatory versus voluntary policies. Mandatory shelter-in-place policies were associated with 3 to 4 fold lower population adjusted mortality in the US model and 11 fold lower in the European one. We conclude that voluntary policies are less effective, based on historical precedent and the current analysis.

72,Targeting of the NLRP3 Inflammasome for early COVID-19,"Following entry and replication of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) into ACE2 expressing cells, the infected cells undergo lysis releasing more virus but also cell contents. In the lung, constitutive cytokines such as IL-1 are released together with other cell contents. A cascade of inflammatory cytokines ensues, including chemokines and IL-1{beta}, triggering both local as well as systemic inflammation. This cascade of inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19 is termed ""Cytokine Release Syndrome"" (CRS), and is associated with poor outcomes and death. Many studies reveal that blocking IL-1 activities in COVID-19 patients reduces disease severity and deaths. Here we report highly significant circulating levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-1 Receptor antagonist, IL-6, TNF, IL-10 and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor in COVID-19 patients with mild or no symptoms. We also report that in circulating myeloid cells from the same patients, there is increased expression of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) early in the infection. We observed increased NLRP3 gene expression in myeloid cells correlated with IL-1{beta} gene expression and also with elevated circulating IL-1{beta} levels. We conclude that early in SARS-CoV-2 infection, NLRP3 activation takes place and initiates the CRS. Thus, NLRP3 is a target to reduce the organ damage of inflammatory cytokines of the CRS.",Carlo Marchetti; Kara Mould; Isak W. Tengesdal; William J. Janssen; Charles A.

73,Increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (VOC 2020212/01) is not accounted for by a replicative advantage in primary airway cells or antibody escape,"Lineage B.1.1.7 (Variant of Concern 202012/01) is a new SARS-CoV-2 variant which was first sequenced in the UK in September 2020 before becoming the majority strain in the UK and spreading worldwide. The rapid spread of the B.1.1.7 variant results from increased transmissibility but the virological characteristics which underpin this advantage over other circulating strains remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that there is no difference in viral replication between B.1.1.7 and other contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 strains in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. However, B.1.1.7 replication is disadvantaged in Vero cells potentially due to increased furin-mediated cleavage of its spike protein as a result of a P681H mutation directly adjacent to the S1/S2 cleavage site. In addition, we show that B.1.1.7 does not escape neutralisation by convalescent or post-vaccination sera.

74,The nonstructural protein 5 of coronaviruses antagonizes GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis by cleaving and inactivating its pore-forming p30 fragment,"Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of RNA viruses that typically cause respiratory, enteric and hepatic diseases in animals and humans. Here, we used porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model of coronaviruses (CoVs) to illustrate the reciprocal regulation between CoVs infection and pyroptosis. For the first time, we clarified the molecular mechanism of porcine Gasdermin D (pGSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis and demonstrated that amino acids T239 and F240 within pGSDMD-p30 are critical for pyroptosis. Furthermore, 3C-like protease Nsp5 from SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, PDCoV and PEDV can cleave human/porcine GSDMD at the Q193-G194 junction upstream of the caspase-1 cleavage site to produce two fragments which fail to trigger pyroptosis or inhibit viral replication. Thus, we provide clear evidence that coronoviruses may utilize viral Nsp5-GSDMD pathway to help their host cells escaping from pyroptosis, protecting the replication of the virus during the initial period, which suggest an important strategy for coronoviruses infection and sustain.",Fushan Shi; Qian Lv; Tingjun Wang; Jidong Xu; Wei Xu; Yuhua Shi; Xinyu Fu; Tianming Yang; Yang Yang; Lenan Zhuang; Weihuan Fang; Jinyan Gu; Xiaoliang Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.432418,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.432418,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,False
75,Targeted Drug Repurposing Against the SARS-CoV-2 E Channel Identifies Blockers With in vitro Antiviral Activity,"It is difficult to overstate the impact that COVID-19 had on humankind. The pandemics etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae, and as such, is an enveloped virus with ion channels in its membrane. Therefore, in an attempt to provide an option to curb the viral spread, we searched for blockers of its E protein viro-porin. Using three bacteria-based assays, we identified eight compounds that exhibited activity after screening a library of ca. 3000 approved-for-human-use drugs. Reassuringly, analysis of viral replication in tissue culture indicated that most of the compounds could reduce infectivity to varying extents. In conclusion, targeting a particular channel in the virus for drug repurposing may increase our arsenal of treatment options to combat COVID-19 virulence.

Significance StatementThe goal of our study was to expand the treatment arsenal against COVID-19. To that end, we have decided to focus on drug therapy, and as a target - the E protein, an ion channel in the virus. Ion channels as a family are excellent drug targets, but viral channels have been underexploited for pharmaceutical point intervention. To hasten future regulatory requirements and focus the chemical search space, we screened a library of ca. 3000 approved-for-human-use drugs using three independent bacteria-based assays. Our results yielded eight compounds, which were subsequently tested for antiviral activity in tissue culture. Gratifyingly, most compounds were able to reduce viral replication, and as such, both validate our approach and potentially augment our anti-COVID tool kit.",Prabhat Pratap Singh Tomar; Miriam Krugliak; Isaiah T Arkin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432490,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432490,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,False
76,A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies interactors of the autophagy pathway as conserved coronavirus targets,"Over the past 20 years, the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoV) - SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 - has shown that CoVs pose a serious risk to human health and highlighted the importance of developing effective therapies against them. Similar to other viruses, CoVs are dependent on host factors for their survival and replication. We hypothesized that evolutionarily distinct CoVs may exploit similar host factors and pathways to support their replication cycle. Here, we conducted two independent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify pan-CoV host factors required for the replication of both endemic and emerging CoVs, including the novel CoV SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including the immunophilin FKBP8, TMEM41B, and MINAR1, were common host factors required for CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin family with the compounds Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin A, and the non-immunosuppressive derivative Alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures that resemble the natural site of virus replication. Overall, we identified host factors that are crucial for CoV replication and demonstrate that these factors constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention by clinically approved drugs.",Annika Kratzel; Jenna N.

An important part of the response is monitoring viral variants and determining the impact they have on viral properties, such as infectivity, disease severity and interactions with drugs and vaccines. In this work we generate and make available computational variant effect predictions for all possible single amino-acid substitutions to SARS-CoV-2 in order to complement and facilitate experiments and expert analysis. The resulting dataset contains predictions from evolutionary conservation and protein and complex structural models, combined with viral phosphosites, experimental results and variant frequencies. We demonstrate predictions effectiveness by comparing them with expectations from variant frequency and prior experiments.

78,SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disturbs nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to advance the viral replication,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. ORF6 is known to antagonize the interferon signaling by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of STAT1. Here we show that ORF6 acts as a virulence factor through two distinct strategies. First, ORF6 directly interacts with STAT1 in an IFN-independent manner to inhibit its nuclear translocation. Second, ORF6 directly binds to importin 1, which is a nuclear transport factor encoded by KPNA2, leading to a significant suppression of importin 1-mediated nuclear transport. Furthermore, we found that KPNA2 knockout enhances the viral replication, suggesting that importin 1 suppresses the viral propagation. Additionally, the analyses of gene expression data revealed that importin 1 levels decreased significantly in the lungs of older individuals. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disrupts the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to accelerate the viral replication, resulting in the disease progression, especially in older individuals.",Yoichi Miyamoto; Yumi Itoh; Tatsuya Suzuki; Tomohisa Tanaka; Yusuke Sakai; Masaru Koido; Chiaki Hata; Cai-Xia Wan; Mayumi Otani; Kohji Moriishi; Taro Tachibana; Yoichiro Kamatani; Yoshihiro Yoneda; Toru Okamoto; Masahiro Oka,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432656,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432656,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,False
79,Implications of central carbon metabolism in SARS-CoV-2 replication and disease severity,"Viruses hijack host metabolic pathways for their replicative advantage. Several observational trans-omics analyses associated carbon and amino acid metabolism in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity in patients but lacked mechanistic insights. In this study, using patient- derived multi-omics data and in vitro infection assays, we aimed to understand i) role of key metabolic pathways in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reproduction and ii) its association with disease severity. Our data suggests that monocytes are key to the altered immune response during COVID-19. COVID-19 infection was associated with increased plasma glutamate levels, while glucose and mannose levels were determinants of the disease severity. Monocytes showed altered expression pattern of carbohydrate and amino acid transporters, GLUT1 and xCT respectively in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, lung epithelial cells (Calu-3) showed a strong acute metabolic adaptation following infection in vitro by modulating central carbon metabolism. We found that glycolysis and glutaminolysis are essential for virus replication and blocking these metabolic pathways caused significant reduction in virus production. Taken together, our study highlights that the virus utilizes and re-wires pathways governing central carbon metabolism leading to metabolic toxicity. Thus, the host metabolic perturbation could be an attractive strategy to limit the viral replication and disease severity.",Shuba Krishnan; Hampus Nordqvist; Anoop T Ambikan; Soham Gupta; Maike Sperk; Sara Svensson-Akusjarvi; Flora Mikaeloff; Rui Benfeitas; Elisa Saccon; Sivasankaran M Ponnan; Jimmy E Rodriguez; Negin Nikouyan; Amani Odeh; Gustaf Ahlen; Muhammad Asghar; Matti Sallberg; Jan Vesterbacka; Piotr Nowak; Akos Vegvari; Anders Sonnerborg; Carl J Treutiger; Ujjwal Neogi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432759,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432759,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,False
80,SARS-CoV-2 detection and genomic sequencing from hospital surface samples collected at UC Davis,"Rationale: There is little doubt that aerosols play a major role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The significance of the presence and infectivity of this virus on environmental surfaces, especially in a hospital setting, remains less clear. Objectives: We aimed to analyze surface swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectivity, and to determine their suitability for sequence analysis. Methods: Samples were collected during two waves of COVID-19 at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, in COVID-19 patient serving and staff congregation areas. qRT-PCR positive samples were investigated in Vero cell cultures for cytopathic effects and phylogenetically assessed by whole genome sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Improved cleaning and patient management practices between April and August 2020 were associated with a substantial reduction of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR positivity (from 11% to 2%) in hospital surface samples. Even though we recovered near-complete genome sequences in some, none of the positive samples (11 of 224 total) caused cytopathic effects in cultured cells suggesting this nucleic acid was either not associated with intact virions, or they were present in insufficient numbers for infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the positive samples were derived from hospitalized patients. Genomic sequences isolated from qRT-PCR negative samples indicate a superior sensitivity of viral detection by sequencing. Conclusions: This study confirms the low likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 contamination on hospital surfaces contains infectious virus, disputing the importance of fomites in COVID-19 transmission. Ours is the first report on recovering near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences directly from environmental surface swabs.",David A Coil; Timothy Albertson; Shefali Banerjee; Greg Brennan; Alexandra J Campbell; Stuart H Cohen; Satya Dandekar; Samuel L Díaz-Muñoz; Jonathan A Eisen; Tracey Goldstein; Ivy R Jose; Maya Juarez; Brandt A Robinson; Stefan Rothenburg; Christian Sandrock; Ana M.M Stoian; Daniel G Tompkins; Alexandre Tremeau-Bravard; Angela Haczku,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252022,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252022,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,True
81,Discovery of a AhR flavonoid agonist that counter-regulates ACE2 expression in rodent models of inflammation and attenuates ACE2-SARS-CoV2 interaction in vitro,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, a newly emerged coronavirus first identified in 2019, is the pathogenetic agent od Corona Virus Induced Disease (COVID)19. The virus enters the human cells after binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor in target tissues. ACE2 expression is induced in response to inflammation. The colon expression of ACE2 is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), highlighting a potential risk of intestinal inflammation in promoting viral entry in the human body. Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of ACE2 in intestinal models of inflammation. The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin, a natural flavonoid bind and activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent DSS in a AhR-dependent manner. In these two models, development of colon inflammation associated with upregulation of ACE2 mRNA expression. Colon levels of ACE2 mRNA were directly correlated with TNF mRNA levels. In contrast to ACE2 the angiotensin 1-7 receptor MAS was downregulated in the inflamed tissues. Molecular docking studies suggested that pelargonidin binds a fatty acid binding pocket on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin significantly reduces the binding of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein to ACE2 and reduces the SARS-CoV2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE2 induction in the inflamed colon in a AhR-dependent manner.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432203,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.432203,2021-02-24,2021-02-24,,False
82,Rapid adaptation and remote delivery of undergraduate research training during the COVID 19 Pandemic,"COVID-19 continues to alter daily life around the globe. Education is particularly affected by shifts to distance learning. This change has poignant effects on all aspects of academic life, including the consequence of increased mental stress reported specifically for students. COVID-19 cancellations of many summer fellowships and internships for undergraduates across the country increased students uncertainty about their educational opportunities and careers. When the pandemic necessitated elimination of on-campus programming at Mayo Clinic, a new program was developed for remote delivery. Summer Foundations in Research (SFIR) was drafted around 4 aims: 1) support the academic trajectory gap in research science created by COVID-19; 2) build sustainable scientific relationships with mentors, peers, and the community; 3) create opportunities for participants to share and address concerns with their own experiences in the pandemic; and 4) provide support for individual wellbeing. SFIR included research training, but also training in communication through generative Dialogue and resilience through Amit Soods SMART program. 170 participants were followed for outcomes in these spaces. Knowledge of and interest in careers involving biomedical research rose significantly following SFIR. Participants mean confidence levels in 12 Key areas of research rose between 0.08 to 1.32 points on a 7-point scale. The strongest gains in mean confidence levels were seen in designing a study and collaborating with others. SFIR participants demonstrated gains in perceived happiness, and measured resilience and a reduction in stress.

It exploits the staggered start of the summer school breaks across German states as an exogenous shock to the travel opportunities of the population. While the school breaks also increased mobility within Germany, the event study regressions include disaggregated and time-varying controls for domestic mobility and local COVID-19-related restrictions.

84,Reproduction as a Means of Evaluating Policy Models: A Case Study of a COVID-19 Simulation,"This article proposes (and demonstrates the effectiveness of) a new strategy for assessing the results of epidemic models which we designate reproduction. The strategy is to build an independent model that uses (as far as possible) only the published information about the model to be assessed. In the example presented here, the independent model also follows a different modelling approach (agent-based modelling) to the model being assessed (the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine compartmental model which has been influential in COVID lockdown policy). The argument runs that if the policy prescriptions of the two models match then this independently supports them (and reduces the chance that they are artefacts of assumptions, modelling approach or programming bugs). If, on the other hand, they do not match then either the model being assessed is not provided with sufficient information to be relied on or (perhaps) there is something wrong with it. In addition to justifying the approach, describing the two models and demonstrating the success of the approach, the article also discusses additional benefits of the reproduction strategy independent of whether match between policy prescriptions is actually achieved.",Edmund Chattoe-Brown; Professor N Gilbert; Duncan A Robertson; Christopher J.

86,"Healthcare personnel knowledge, motivations, concerns and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccines: a cross-sectional survey","BackgroundHealthcare personnel (HCP) are prioritized for earliest SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration, yet relatively few data exist on HCPs knowledge, motivations, concerns, and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccines.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey Nov.16-Dec.8, 2020 among HCP enrolled in a cohort study at three Northern California medical centers serving diverse roles including COVID-19 patient care. Eligible HCP were adult (age[&ge;]18) on-site employees of the University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital, and Stanford Healthcare. A one-time electronically-administered survey was sent to cohort HCP on November 16, 2020 and responses analyzed.

ResultsOverall, among 2,448 HCP invited, 2,135 completed the COVID-19 vaccine survey (87.2% response rate). HCPs had mean age 41 years, were 73% female, and had diverse jobs including COVID-19 patient contact. Enthusiasm for vaccination was overall strong, and more HCP (1,453, 69%) said they would definitely/likely receive vaccine if formally FDA-approved versus if approved via emergency use authorization only (785, 35%). While 541 (25%) respondents wanted to be among the earliest to receive vaccine, more desired vaccination after the first round (777, 36%) or >2 months after vaccinations began (389, 18%). Top factors increasing motivation for vaccination included perceiving risk from COVID-19 to self (1,382, 65%) or to family/friends (1355, 63%). Top concerns were vaccine side effects, cited by 596 (28%), and concerns about political involvement in FDAs approval process (249, 12%).

ConclusionsHCP were enthusiastic about COVID-19 vaccination for individual protection and protecting others, but harbored concerns about vaccine side effects. Our data may inform emerging vaccine education campaigns.

Key PointsAmong 2,135 healthcare personnel surveyed, we found enthusiasm for COVID-19 vaccination both for individual benefit and protecting others.

87,The U-shaped association of serum iron level with COVID-19 severity: Is iron a potential therapeutic target?,"ObjectiveTo evaluate the association between iron metabolism indicators and disease severity in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

DesignTwo-center observational study

SettingA university hospital and a core hospital in Yokohama, Japan

PatientsAdults with COVID-19 whose serum iron levels were measured within the first 5 days of hospitalization were included. Patients who refused mechanical ventilation were excluded from the study.

Measurements and Main ResultsOne hundred thirty-six patients were included in this study. We analyzed the association between COVID-19 severity and serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. Disease severity was defined as the worst respiratory status during hospitalization. Serum iron levels were significantly lower in patients with mild respiratory failure (RF) (n=55, median serum iron level: 24 [interquartile range: 19-42] mg/dL) than in the non-RF group (n=44, 40 [24-80] mg/dL) and the severe RF group (n=37, 60 [23.5-87] mg/dL); however, there were no significant differences in iron levels between the non-RF and severe RF groups (non-RF vs. mild RF: p=0.019, non-RF vs. severe RF: p>0.999, and mild RF vs. severe RF: p=0.009). That is, there was a U-shaped association between serum iron levels and disease severity. TIBC levels decreased significantly with increasing severity; consequently, TSAT was significantly higher in patients with severe RF than in other patients. Multivariate analysis including only patients with RF adjusted for age and sex demonstrated that higher serum iron or TSAT levels were independently associated with development of severe RF.

ConclusionsA U-shaped association between serum iron level and RF severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was observed. Higher serum iron levels in COVID-19 patients with RF are associated with the development of severe RF, indicating that inadequate response to lower serum iron might be an exacerbating factor for COVID-19.",Kentaro Tojo; Yoh Sugawara; Yasufumi Oi; Fumihiro Ogawa; Takuma Higurashi; Yukihiro Yoshimura; Nobuyuki Miyata; Hajime Hayami; Yoshikazu Yamaguchi; Yoko Ishikawa; Ichiro Takeuchi; Natsuo Tachikawa; Takahisa Goto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252061,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
88,Efficacy and safety of Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19. A randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundIn the search for active drugs against COVID-19, the indications of many have been redirected. Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine are drugs that inhibit viral replication in vitro and that have been used in several medical centers.

ObjectivesThis clinical trial analyzes the efficacy of Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine in patients with moderate COVID-19 and in need of hospitalization.

MethodsThis a controlled, clinical, randomized, double-blind trial that included patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and hospitalization criteria, but no severe respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to one of three groups: Group1-hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg every 12 hours on the first day and subsequently, 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days, Group 2-ivermectin, 12 mg or 18 mg, according to patient weight and, Group 3-placebo. At inclusion, blood samples for arterial blood gases and biochemical markers associated with a poor prognosis were obtained. The primary outcome was established as the duration of hospitalization until discharge due to patient improvement, the total duration of hospitalization, and the safety outcomes were either respiratory deterioration or death.

ResultsDuring the month of August, the admission of patients requiring hospitalization mostly encompassed cases with severe respiratory failure, so we ended the recruitment process and analyzed the data that was available at the time. One hundred and six (106) patients with an average age of 53 yrs. ({+/-}16.9) were included, with a greater proportion of males (n=66, 62.2 %). Seventy-two percent (72%) (n= 76) had an associated comorbidity. Ninety percent (90 %) of patients were discharged due to improvement (n=96). The average duration of hospitalization was 6 days (IQR, 3 - 10). No difference in hospitalization duration was found between the treatment groups (Group1: 7 vs Group 2: 6 vs Group 3: 5, p=0.43) nor in respiratory deterioration or death (Group 1: 18 % vs Group 2: 22.2 % vs Group 3: 24.3 %, p =0.83).

ConclusionsIn non-critical hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, neither ivermectin nor hydroxychloroquine decreases the number of in-hospital days, respiratory deterioration, or deaths.

This study analyzed the performance and correlation of two independent quantitative anti-S1 assays in oligo-/asymptomatic individuals from a previously characterized population-based cohort.

MethodsA total of 362 samples included 108 from individuals who had viral RNA detected in pharyngeal swabs, 111 negative controls and 143 samples with positive serology but not confirmed by RT-PCR. Blood plasma was tested with quantitative assays Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA (IgG) (EI-S1-IgG-quant) and Roche Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 CoV-2 S (Ro-RBD-Ig-quant), which were compared with each other and with confirmatory tests, including wild-type virus micro-neutralization (NT) and GenScript(R)cPass. Results were analyzed using square roots R of coefficients of determination for association among continuous variables and non-parametric tests for paired comparisons.

ResultsQuantitative anti-S1 serology correlated well with each other (96%/97% for true-positives and true-negatives, respectively). Antibody titers decreased over time (from <30 days to >240 days after initial positive RT-PCR).

90,Role of Heterogeneous Transmission in the Decline of COVID-19 Cases During Winter of 2020/2021 in Massachusetts,"ImportanceHeterogeneity in transmission of COVID-19 is a significant multiscale phenomenon. However, the role of this heterogeneity in shaping the overall dynamics of disease transmission is not well understood.

ObjectiveTo investigate the role of heterogeneous transmission among different towns in Massachusetts in shaping the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, especially the recent decline during winter of 2020/2021.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsAnalysis of COVID-19 data collected and archived by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

ExposuresThe entire population of the state of Massachusetts is exposed to the virus responsible for COVID-19, to varying degrees. This study quantifies this variation.

Main outcome measuresWeekly observations, by town, on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts, during the period (April 15th, 2020 to February 9th 2021).

ResultsThe relative decline in COVID-19 cases, during January 12th, 2021 to February 9th, 2021, in the group of towns with higher total accumulated cases in the period before January 12th, 2021 is significantly larger than the corresponding relative decline in the group of towns with lower accumulated cases during the same period.

Conclusions and RelevanceHeterogeneous nature of transmission is playing a significant role in shaping the rapid recent decline (January 12th to February 9th, 2021) in reported cases in Massachusetts, and probably around the country. These findings are relevant to how we estimate the threshold defining ""herd"" immunity, suggesting that we should account for effects due to heterogeneity.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes heterogeneity in disease transmission play a role in shaping the overall dynamics of COVID-19 in Massachusetts, including the recent decline in cases during the 2020/2021 winter.

FindingsBased on analysis of data on cases in Massachusetts, the consistent and widespread decline of COVID-19 spread during winter of 2020/2021 (January 12th, 2021 to February 9th, 2021) appears to be shaped to a significant degree by the heterogeneous nature of transmission at the scale of different towns. Towns with a history of high (low) transmission rates during 2020 are experiencing a faster (slower) relative decline.

MeaningWe suggest that heterogeneity in transmission of COVID-19 may impact the dynamics of disease transmission including the emergence of ""herd"" immunity, in line with some recent theoretical studies. This finding deserves some attention from other research groups investigating ""herd"" immunity, and from federal and state public health authorities concerned with the future evolution of the pandemic.",Yeon-Woo Choi; Marcia C.

91,"The Association of Opioid Use Disorder and COVID-19 in Shahroud, Iran","BackgroundCOVID-19 quickly spread to the world, causing a pandemic. While some studies have found no link between Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and COVID-19, the role of the opioid on COVID-19 is challenging. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between OUD and COVID-19.

MethodsThis was a prospective cohort study. We used data from the third phase of the Shahroud eye cohort study on 4394 participants which started in September 2019 and ended before the COVID-19 epidemic in Shahroud in February 2020. The participants were followed for 10.5 months till November 2020. COVID-19 was detected by RT-PCR on swap samples from the oropharynx and nasopharynx. The incidence of COVID-19 compared in OUD and Non-OUD participants, and relative risk was calculated in Log Binomial Regression model.

ResultsAmong the 4394 participants with a mean age of 61.1 years, 120 people had OUD. The incidence of COVID-19 in participants with OUD and Non-OUD were 3.3% and 4.5%, respectively. The relative risk of OUD for COVID-19 was 0.75 (95% Confidence intervals: 0.28 - 1.98; P= 0.555).

ConclusionsOpioid use disorder was not associated with COVID-19. The claim that people with OUD are less likely to develop COVID-19 is not supported by this data.",Zhaleh Jamali; Mohammad Hassan Emamian; Hassan Hashemi; Akbar Fotouhi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252093,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252093,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
92,Efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected dying cells impairs macrophage anti-inflammatory programming and continual clearance of apoptotic cells,"COVID-19 is a disease of dysfunctional immune responses, but the mechanisms triggering immunopathogenesis are not established. The functional plasticity of macrophages allows this cell type to promote pathogen elimination and inflammation or suppress inflammation and promote tissue remodeling and injury repair. During an infection, the clearance of dead and dying cells, a process named efferocytosis, can modulate the interplay between these contrasting functions. Here, we show that engulfment of SARS-CoV2-infected apoptotic cells (AC) exacerbates inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits the expression of efferocytic receptors, and impairs continual efferocytosis by macrophages. We also provide evidence that monocytes from severe COVID-19 patients express reduced levels of efferocytic receptors and fail to uptake AC. Our findings reveal that dysfunctional efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cell corpses suppress macrophage anti-inflammation and efficient tissue repair programs and provide mechanistic insights for the pathogenesis of the hyperinflammation and extensive tissue damage associated with COVID-19.",Douglas dos-Santos; Ana C.

93,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among Greek adults: a cross-sectional survey.,"The COVID-19 virus characterised as a pandemic in 2020 at its outbreak around the world has been recorded to have severe effects on the global health and mental health. The current research is accomplished during the first period of the restrictive measures in Greece March - April 2020 and is aiming to evaluate the COVID-19 effect on mental health of the population. The STAI and DASS-21 questionnaires have been used in order to accomplish the aims of the study. The results (n = 527) show a moderate level on mental health status of the sample STAI-S: 45.8, STAI-T: 40.7, Depression: 4.6, Anxiety: 3.1 and Stress: 6.1. The research shows that women, younger respondents, lower income households and those living on smaller houses suffer from increased depression, anxiety and stress. Additionally, factors of the daily habits within the period of COVID-19 such as mask, gloves and use of antiseptic can drastically decrease illnesses of mental health. Such findings can be used from the Greek State in order to reduce the effects of COVID-19 in mental health of the population and protect the socially vulnerable groups.",Efthimios Dragotis; Korina Atsopardi; Anastasia Barbouni; Konstantinos Farsalinos; Konstantinos Poulas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252129,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252129,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
94,Follow-up study in the ski-resort Ischgl: Antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 persisted for up to 8 months after infection and transmission of virus was low even during the second infection wave in Austria,"BackgroundIn early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl in Austria initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern Europe. In a cross-sectional study, we found that the seroprevalence in the adult population of Ischgl had reached 45% by the end of April. To answer the question of how long immunity persists and what effect this high-level immunity had on virus transmission, we performed a follow-up study in early November, 2020.

MethodsOf the 1259 adults that participated in the baseline study, 801 could be included in the follow-up. The study involved the analysis of binding and neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. In addition, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ischgl was compared to the incidence in similar municipalities in Tyrol throughout 2020.

FindingsFor the 801 individuals that participated in both studies, the seroprevalence declined from 51.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47.9 - 54.9) to 45.4% (95% CI 42.0 - 49.0). Median antibody concentrations dropped considerably but antibody avidity increased. T cell responses were analysed in 93 cases, including all 4 formerly seropositive cases that had lost antibodies in all assays, three of which still had detectable T cell memory. In addition, the incidence in the second COVID-19 wave that hit Austria in November 2020, was significantly lower in Ischgl than in comparable municipalities in Tyrol or the rest of Austria.

InterpretationThis study has important implications as it shows that although antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 declined, T and B cell memory can be detected for up to 8 months. Complemented by infection prevention measures a level of around 40-45% immunity in Ischgl significantly reduced local virus transmission during the second wave in Austria in November 2020.

95,Long-term air pollution and other risk factors associated with COVID-19 at the census-tract-level in Colorado,"An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic requires identification of the factors that affect the severity and mortality of the disease. Previous nationwide studies have reported links between long-term PM2.5 concentrations and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. In order to translate these results to the state level, we use Bayesian hierarchical models to explore potential links between long-term PM2.5 concentrations and census tract-level rates of COVID-19 outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, and deaths) in Colorado. We explicitly consider how the uncertainty in PM2.5 estimates affect our results by comparing four different PM2.5 surfaces from academic and governmental organizations. After controlling for 20 census tract level covariates including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, social distancing, age demographics, comorbidity rates, meteorology, and testing rate, we find that our results depend heavily on the choice of PM2.5 surface. Using PM2.5 estimates from the United States EPA, we find that a 1 {micro}g/m3 increase in long term PM2.5 is associated with a statistically significant 25% increase in the relative risk of hospitalizations and a 35% increase in mortality. Results for all other surfaces and outcomes were not statistically significant. At the same time, we find a clear association between communities of color and COVID-19 outcomes at the Colorado census-tract level that is minimally affected by the choice of PM2.5 surface. A per-interquartile range (IQR) increase in the percent of non-African American people of color was associated with a 31%, 44%, and 59% increase in the relative risk of infection, hospitalization, and mortality respectively, while a per-IQR increase in the proportion of non-Hispanic African Americans was associated with a 4% and 7% increase in the relative risk of infections and hospitalizations. These results have strong implications for the implementation of an equitable public health response during the crisis and suggest targeted areas for additional air monitoring in Colorado.",Kevin Berg; Paul Romer Present; Kristy Richardson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252019,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252019,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
96,Clinical profile and factors associated with COVID-19 in Cameroon: a prospective cohort study,"ObjectivesThis study explores the clinical profiles and factors associated with COVID-19 in Cameroon.

Research design and methodsIn this prospective cohort study, we followed patients admitted for suspicion of COVID-19 at Djoungolo Hospital between 01st April and 31st July 2020. Patients were categorised by age groups and disease severity: mild (symptomatic without clinical signs of pneumonia pneumonia), moderate (with clinical signs of pneumonia without respiratory distress) and severe cases (clinical signs of pneumonia and respiratory distress not requiring invasive ventilation). Demographic information and clinical features were summarised. Multivariable analysis was performed to predict risk.

ResultsA total of 323 patients were admitted during the study period; 262 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the confirmed cases, the male group aged 40 to 49 years (13.9%) was predominant. Disease severity ranged from mild (77%; N=204) to moderate (15%; N=40) to severe (7%; N=18); the case fatality rate was 1% (N=4). Dysgusia (46%; N=111) and hyposmia/anosmia (39%; N=89) were common features of COVID-19. Nearly one-third of patients had comorbidities (29%; N=53), of which hypertension was the most common (20%; N=48). Participation in a mass gathering (OR=5.47; P=0.03) was a risk factor for COVID-19. Age groups 60 to 69 (OR=7.41; P=0.0001), 50 to 59 (OR=4.09; P=0.03), 40 to 49 (OR=4.54; P=0.01), male gender (OR=2.53; P=0.04), diabetes (OR= 4.05; P= 0.01), HIV infection (OR=5.57; P=0.03), lung disease (OR= 6.29; P=0.01), dyspnoea (OR=3.70; P=0.008) and fatigue (OR=3.35; P=0.02) significantly predicted COVID-19 severity.

MethodsBetween June 9 and August 10, 2020, we conducted a self-administered, web-based survey among homeless shelter workers in Washington, Massachusetts, Utah, Maryland, and Georgia, in shelters where at least 1 staff person had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We calculated frequencies for demographics, work environment, personal protective equipment use, and SARS-CoV-2 testing history. We used generalized linear models with a binary outcome (COVID-19 positivity) and a log link, clustered by shelter network, to produce unadjusted prevalence ratios (PR) for demographics, work environment, and mitigation measures.

ResultsOf the 106 respondents, 43.4% reported frequent close contact with clients and 85.8% reported wearing a mask most or all of the time; 75% reported being worried about being infected with SARS-CoV-2 at work; 15% reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those who reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 80% (12/15) believed they were infected at work. Frequent close contact with clients was significantly associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PR 3.97, 95% CI 1.06, 14.93).

98,Controlling the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi: results from a panel study,"Many African countries have experienced a first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between June and August of 2020. According to case counts reported daily by epidemiological surveillance systems, infection rates remained low in most countries. This defied early models of the potential impact of COVID-19 on the continent, that projected large outbreaks and massive strain on health systems. Theories proposed to explain the apparently limited spread of the novel coronavirus in most African countries have emphasized 1) early actions by health authorities (e.g., border closures) and 2) biological or environmental determinants of the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., warm weather, cross-immunity). In this paper, we explored additional factors that might contribute to the low recorded burden of COVID-19 in Malawi, a low-income country in Southeastern Africa. To do so, we used 4 rounds of panel data collected among a sample of adults during the first 6 months of the pandemic in the country. Our analyses of survey data on SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-related symptoms indicate that the size of the outbreak that occurred in June-August 2020 might be larger than recorded by surveillance systems that rely on RT-PCR testing. Our data also document the widespread adoption of physical distancing and mask use in response to the outbreak, whereas most measured patterns of social contacts remained stable during the course of the panel study.

99,Health-related quality of life of adult COVID-19 patients following one-month illness experience since diagnosis: findings of a cross-sectional study in Bangladesh,"BackgroundThe pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stances an incredible impact on the quality of life of the patients. The disease not only denigrates the physical health of the patients but also affects their mental health. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients.

MethodsThe study was conducted at the National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM), Dhaka, Bangladesh during the period from June to November 2020. The study enrolled 1204 adult (>18 years) COVID-19 patients diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and completed the one-month duration of illness. The patients were interviewed with the CDC HRQOL-14 questionnaire to assess their HRQOL. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing medical records using a semi-structured questionnaire and checklist respectively. Informed consent was obtained from each patient before data collection.

ResultsThe majority of the COVID-19 patients were males (72.3%), urban residents (50.2%), and diverse service holders (49.6%). More than one-third (35.5%) of patients had comorbidity including hypertension (55.6%), diabetes mellitus (55.6%), ischaemic heart disease (16.4%), chronic lung (12.4%), kidney (2.8%), and liver (4.2%) diseases. The mean{+/-}SD duration of physical illness was 9.83({+/-}7.09) days, and it was 7.97({+/-}8.12) days for mental illness. During the one-month disease course, the general health condition was excellent/very good/good in 70.1% of the patients while it was fair/poor in 29.8% of the patients. Older age, sex, and marital status were significantly associated with at least one dimension of HRQOL. Patients having symptoms of COVID-19 and comorbidity had significantly poorer HRQOL.

ConclusionCOVID-19 pretenses a significant impact on the HRQOL of the patients including physical and mental illness during the clinical course. Our findings suggest more pragmatic preventive, promotive, and curative measures considering illness experiences of the COVID-19 patients to restore their quality of life.

HighlightsSince COVID-19 was identified first in china in 2019, it has been transmitted globally and caused a significant impact on human health. A few studies have been carried out on HRQOL of COVID-19 patients and struggled with an accurate estimation of the severity of their physical and mental illness. Most of the studies recognized the poor quality of life of COVID-19 patients after the one-month disease course. Our study provides new insights on the HRQOL of the COVID-19 patients using the CDC HRQOL-14 questionnaire. We measured the HRQOL following one-month illness experience of the patients using three modules: the healthy days core; the activity limitations; and the healthy days symptoms. The study adds information regarding general health conditions including both the physical and mental health of COVID-19 patients. The study also complements information regarding the activity limitations of the patients. The study findings could contribute to designing an efficient clinical algorithm to alleviate the illness sufferings of the COVID-19 patients using a more pragmatic approach. The study conserves decisive policy implications to concoct effective interventions for improving the HRQOL of COVID-19 patients in the country and elsewhere in other countries world-wide.",Md.

100,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Considering Shared Chairs in Outpatient Dialysis: A Real-World Case-Control Study,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through aerosolized droplets; however, the virus can remain transiently viable on surfaces.

ObjectiveWe examined transmission within hemodialysis facilities, with a specific focus on the possibility of indirect patient-to-patient transmission through shared dialysis chairs.

DesignWe used real-world data from hemodialysis patients treated between February 1st and June 8th, 2020 to perform a case-control study matching each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient (case) to a non-SARS-CoV-2 patient (control) in the same dialysis shift and traced back 14 days to capture possible exposure from chairs sat in by SARS-CoV-2 patients. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, race, facility, shift date, and treatment count.

Setting2,600 hemodialysis facilities in the United States.

PatientsAdult (age [&ge;]18 years) hemodialysis patients.

MeasurementsConditional logistic regression models tested whether chair exposure after a positive patient conferred a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the immediate subsequent patient.

ResultsAmong 170,234 hemodialysis patients, 4,782 (2.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean age 64 years, 44% female). Most facilities (68.5%) had 0 to 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 patient. We matched 2,379 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases to 2,379 non-SARS-CoV-2 controls; 1.30% (95%CI 0.90%, 1.87%) of cases and 1.39% (95%CI 0.97%, 1.97%) of controls were exposed to a chair previously sat in by a shedding SARS-CoV-2 patient. Transmission risk among cases was not significantly different from controls (OR=0.94; 95%CI 0.57 to 1.54; p=0.80). Results remained consistent in adjusted and sensitivity analyses.

LimitationAnalysis used real-world data that could contain errors and only considered vertical transmission associated with shared use of dialysis chairs by symptomatic patients.

ConclusionsThe risk of indirect patient-to-patient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from dialysis chairs appears to be low.

101,SARS-CoV-2 disinfection in aqueous solution by UV222 from a krypton chlorine excilamp,"There is an urgent need for evidence-based development and implementation of engineering controls to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Ultraviolet (UV) light can inactivate coronaviruses, but the practicality of UV light as an engineering control in public spaces is limited by the hazardous nature of conventional UV lamps, which are Mercury (Hg)-based and emit a peak wavelength (254 nm) that penetrates human skin and is carcinogenic. Recent advances in the development and production of Krypton Chlorine (KrCl) excimer lamps hold promise in this regard, as these emit a shorter peak wavelength (222 nm) and are recently being produced to filter out emission above 240 nm. However, the disinfection kinetics of KrCl UV excimer lamps against SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. Here we provide the first dose response report for SARS-CoV-2 exposed to a commercial filtered KrCl excimer light source emitting primarily 222 nm UV light (UV222), using multiple assays of SARS-CoV-2 viability. Plaque infectivity assays demonstrate the pseudo-first order rate constant of SARS-CoV-2 reduction of infectivity to host cells to be 0.64 cm2/mJ (R2 = 0.95), which equates to a D90 (dose for 1 log10 or 90% inactivation) of 1.6 mJ/cm2. Through RT-qPCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene with a short (<100 bp) and long ([~]1000 bp) amplicon in samples immediately after UV222 exposure, the reduction of ability to amplify indicated an approximately 10% contribution of N gene damage to disinfection kinetics. Through ELISA assay targeting the N protein in samples immediately after UV222 exposure, we found no dose response of the ability to damage the N protein. In both qPCR assays and the ELISA assay of viral outgrowth supernatants collected 3 days after incubation of untreated and UV222 treated SARS-CoV-2, molecular damage rate constants were similar, but lower than disinfection rate constants. These data provide quantitative evidence for UV222 doses required to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous solution that can be used to develop further understanding of disinfection in air, and to inform decisions about implementing UV222 for preventing transmission of COVID19.

102,The Association of Opening K-12 Schools and Colleges with the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States: County-Level Panel Data Analysis,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThis paper empirically examines how the opening of K-12 schools and colleges is associated with the spread of COVID-19 using county-level panel data in the United States. Using data on foot traffic and K-12 school opening plans, we analyze how an increase in visits to schools and opening schools with different teaching methods (in-person, hybrid, and remote) is related to the 2-weeks forward growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies, interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the positive association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These results have a causal interpretation in a structural model with unobserved county and time confounders. Sensitivity analysis shows that the baseline results are robust to timing assumptions and alternative specifications.",Victor Chernozhukov; Hiroyuki Kasahara; Paul Schrimpf,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252131,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
103,"Phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination: rapid assessment of policy adoption, reach and effectiveness to protect the most vulnerable in the US","ObjectivesThe US and rest of the world have suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year. The high transmissibility and severity of this virus have provoked governments to adopt a variety of mitigation strategies. Some of these previous measures, such as social distancing and mask mandates, were effective in reducing the case growth rate yet became economically and administratively difficult to enforce as the pandemic continued. In late December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines were first approved in the US and states began a phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is limited quantitative evidence regarding the effectiveness of the phased COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to provide a rapid assessment of the adoption, reach, and effectiveness of the phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsWe utilize an event-study analysis to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the state-level, daily COVID-19 case growth rate.

ResultsThrough this analysis, we assert that vaccination is effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 shortly after the first shots were given. Specifically, the case growth rate declined by 0.124, 0.347, 0.345, 0.464, 0.490, and 0.756 percentage points corresponding to the 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, and 26 or more day periods after the initial shots.

ConclusionsThe findings could be insightful for policymakers as they work to optimize vaccine distribution in later phases, and also for the public as the COVID-19 related health risk is a contentious issue.",Yun Li; Moming Li; Megan Rice; Yanfang Su; Chaowei Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252118,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252118,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
104,Analysis of key factors of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program: A mathematical modeling approach,"The administration of vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) just started in early December of 2020. Currently, there are only a few approved vaccines, each with different efficacies and mechanisms of action. Moreover, vaccination programs in different regions may vary due to differences in implementation, for instance, simply the availability of the vaccine. In this article, we study the impact of the pace of vaccination and the intrinsic efficacy of the vaccine on prevalence, hospitalizations, and deaths related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Then we study different potential future scenarios regarding the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in the near future. We construct a compartmental mathematical model and use computational methodologies to study these different scenarios. Thus, we are able identify some key factors to reach the aims of the vaccination programs. We use some metrics related to the outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to assess the impact of the efficacy of the vaccine and the pace of the vaccine inoculation. We found that both factors have a high impact on the outcomes. However, the rate of vaccine administration has a higher impact in reducing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. This result shows that health institutions need to focus in increasing the vaccine inoculation pace and create awareness in the population about the importance of COVID-19 vaccines.",David Martinez-Rodriguez; Gilberto Gonzalez-Parra; Rafael-J Villanueva-Mico,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252095,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252095,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
105,Analyzing Socioeconomic Factors and Health Disparity of COVID-19 Spatiotemporal Spread Patterns at Neighborhood Levels in San Diego County,"This study analyzed spatiotemporal spread patterns of COVID-19 confirmed cases at the zip code level in the County of San Diego and compared them to neighborhood social and economic factors. We used correlation analysis, regression models, and geographic weighted regression to identify important factors and spatial patterns. We broke down the temporal confirmed case patterns into four stages from 1 April 2020 to 31 December 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak hotspots in San Diego County are South Bay, El Cajon, Escondido, and rural areas. The spatial patterns among different stages may represent fundamental health disparity issues in neighborhoods. We also identified important variables with strong positive or negative correlations in these categories: ethnic groups, languages, economics, and education. The highest association variables were Pop5andOlderSpanish (Spanish-speaking) in Stage 4 (0.79) and Pop25OlderLess9grade (Less than 9th grade education) in Stage 4 (0.79). We also observed a clear pattern that regions with more well-educated people have negative associations with COVID-19. Additionally, our OLS regression models suggested that more affluent populations have a negative relationship with COVID-19 cases. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak is not only a medical disease but a social inequality and health disparity problem.",Ming-Hsiang Tsou; Jian Xu; Chii-Dean Lin; Morgan Daniels; Eunjeong Ko; Joseph Gibbons,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21251757,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21251757,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
106,Seven-month kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and protective role of pre-existing antibodies to seasonal human coronaviruses on COVID-19,"Unraveling the long-term kinetics of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and its determinants, including the impact of pre-existing antibodies to human coronaviruses causing common cold (HCoVs), is essential to understand protective immunity to COVID-19 and devise effective surveillance strategies. IgM, IgA and IgG levels against six SARS-CoV-2 and four HCoV antigens were quantified by Luminex, and antibody neutralization capacity was assessed by flow cytometry, in a cohort of health care workers followed-up for 6 months. Seroprevalence increased over time from 13.5% (month 0) and 15.6% (month 1) to 16.4% (month 6). Levels of antibodies, including those with neutralizing capacity, were stable over time, except IgG to nucleocapsid antigen and IgM levels that waned. After the peak response, anti-spike antibody levels increased from [~]150 days post-symptom onset in all individuals (73% for IgG), in the absence of any evidence of re-exposure. Pre-existing antibodies to alpha-HCoV were lower in individuals who subsequently seroconverted for SARS-CoV-2. IgG and IgA to HCoV were significantly higher in asymptomatic than symptomatic seropositive individuals. Thus, pre-existing cross-reactive HCoVs antibodies could have a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.",Natalia Ortega; Marta Ribes; Marta Vidal; Rocio Rubio; Ruth Aguilar; Sarah Williams; Diana Barrios; Selena Alonso; Pablo Hernandez-Luis; Robert Andrew Mitchell; Chenjerai Jairoce; Angeline Marie Cruz; Alfons Jimenez; Rebeca Santano; Susana Mendez; Montserrat Lamoglia; Neus Rosell; Anna Llupia; Laura Puyol; Jordi Chi; Natalia Rodrigo; Daniel Parras; Pau Serra; Alfredo Mayor; Sonia Barroso; Pilar Varela; Anna Vilella; Antoni Trilla; Pere Santamaria; Carlo Carolis; Marta Tortajada; Luis Izquierdo; Ana Angulo; Pablo Engel; Alberto Garcia-Basteiro; Gemma Moncunill; Carlota Dobano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252150,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252150,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
107,COVID-19 Spreading dynamics in an age-structured population with selective relaxation of restrictions for vaccinated individuals : a mathematical modeling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccination of healthcare and other essential workers is underway in many countries while immunization of the general public is expected to begin in the next several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately permitted to return to normal activities.

MethodsWe use a delay differential equation model to calculate the effects of vaccinee ""immunity passports"" on the epidemic spreading trajectories. The model incorporates age-structuring to account for children who are ineligible for vaccination, and senior citizens who are especially vulnerable to the disease. We consider consensus strains of virus as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 and B1.351 in our analysis.

ResultsWe find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, unrestricted vaccinee--vaccinee interactions do not derail the epidemic from a path towards elimination. Vaccinee--non-vaccinee interactions should however be treated with far more caution. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be the better part of a year before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or ceased. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent, restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until the elimination of the disease is achieved. In all cases, the death tolls can be reduced by vaccinating the vulnerable population first.

ConclusionsDesigning high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drives with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants of efficacy, if any, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive augmented with selective relaxations for vaccinees will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death tolls and socio-economic cost.",B Shayak; Mohit Manoj Sharma; Anand Kumar Mishra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252241,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252241,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True

Here, we performed untargeted/targeted lipidomics and focused biochemistry on 127 patient plasma samples, and showed high levels of circulating, enzymatically active secreted phospholipase A2 Group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) in severe and fatal COVID-19 disease compared with uninfected patients or mild illness. Machine learning demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA effectively stratifies severe from fatal COVID-19 disease. We further introduce a PLA-BUN index that combines sPLA2-IIA and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) threshold levels as a critical risk factor for mitochondrial dysfunction, sustained inflammatory injury and lethal COVID-19. With the availability of clinically tested inhibitors of sPLA2-IIA, our study opens the door to a precision intervention using indices discovered here to reduce COVID-19 mortality.",Justin M Snider; Jeehyun Karen You; Xia Wang; Ashley J Snider; Brian Hallmark; Michael C Seeds; Susan Sergeant; Laurel Johnstone; Qiuming Wang; Ryan Sprissler; Hao Helen Zhang; Chiara Luberto; Richard R Kew; Yusuf A Hannun; Charles E McCall; Guang Yao; Maurizio Del Poeta; Floyd H Chilton,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252237,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252237,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
109,The spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infection in England between January and June 2020.,"The spatio-temporal dynamics of an outbreak provide important insights to help direct public health resources intended to control transmission. They also provide a focus for detailed epidemiological studies and allow the timing and impact of interventions to be assessed.

A common approach is to aggregate case data to administrative regions. Whilst providing a good visual impression of change over space, this method masks spatial variation and assumes that disease risk is constant across space. Risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g. population density, deprivation and ethnicity) vary from place to place across England so it follows that risk will also vary spatially. Kernel density estimation compares the spatial distribution of cases relative to the underlying population, unfettered by arbitrary geographical boundaries, to produce a continuous estimate of spatially varying risk.

Using test results from healthcare settings in England (Pillar 1 of the UK Government testing strategy) and freely available methods and software, we estimated the spatial and spatio-temporal risk of COVID-19 infection across England for the first six months of 2020. Widespread transmission was underway when partial lockdown measures were introduced on the 23rd March 2020 and the greatest risk erred towards large urban areas. The rapid growth phase of the outbreak coincided with multiple introductions to England from the European mainland. The spatio-temporal risk was highly labile throughout.

In terms of controlling transmission, the most important practical application is the accurate identification of areas within regions that may require tailored intervention strategies. We recommend that this approach is absorbed into routine surveillance outputs in England. Further risk characterisation using widespread community testing (Pillar 2) data is needed as is the increased use of predictive spatial models at fine spatial scales.",Richard Elson; Tilman M Davies; Iain R Lake; Roberto Vivancos; Paula B Blomquist; Andre Charlett; Gavin Dabrera,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21251534,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21251534,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
110,Nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a 'non-COVID-19' hospital ward: virus genome sequencing as a key tool to understand cryptic transmission,"BackgroundDissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare institutions affects both patients and health-care workers (HCW), as well as the institutional capacity to provide essential health services.

MethodsWe conducted an investigation of a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases detected in a ""non-COVID-19"" hospital ward during Summer 2020. The magnitude of the nosocomial outbreak was disclosed by massive testing, challenging the retrospective reconstruction of the introduction and transmission events. An in-depth contact tracing investigation was carried out to identify the contacts network during the 15-day period before the screening. In parallel, positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples were subjected to virus genome sequencing.

ResultsOf the 245 tested individuals, 48 (21 patients and 27 HCWs) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. HCWs were mostly asymptomatic, but the mortality among the vulnerable patient group reached 57.1% (12/21). Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that all cases were part of the same transmission chain, thus confirming a single origin behind this nosocomial outbreak. By combining vast epidemiological and genomic data, including analysis of emerging minor variants, we unveiled a scenario of silent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination within the hospital ward, mostly driven by the close contact within the HCWs group and between HCWs and patients. This investigation triggered enhanced prevention and control measures, leading to a more timely detection and containment of novel nosocomial outbreaks.

ConclusionsThe present study shows the benefit of combining genomic and epidemiological data for the investigation of complex nosocomial outbreaks, and provides valuable data to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.

Short summarySARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks are of utmost public health concern.

111,"Beliefs associated with Intentions of Non-Physician Healthcare Workers to Receive the COVID-19 Vaccine in Ontario, Canada","Achieving herd immunity of SARS-CoV-2 through vaccines will require a concerted effort to understand and address barriers to vaccine uptake. We conducted a web-based survey of non-physician HCWs, informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, measuring intention to vaccinate, beliefs and sources of influence relating to the COVID-19 vaccines, and sociodemographic characteristics. Vaccination non-intent was associated with beliefs that vaccination was not required because of good health, lower confidence that the COVID-19 vaccine would protect their family and patients, and that getting vaccinated was a professional responsibility. Vaccination non-intent was strongly associated with mistrust about how fast the vaccines were developed and vaccine safety concerns. Communication directed at non-physician HCWs should be tailored by ethnic subgroups and settings to increase salience. Messaging should leverage emotions (e.g., pride, hope, fear) to capture interest, while addressing safety concerns and confirming the low risk of side effects in contrast to the substantial morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

112,Evolving Infection Paradox of SARS-CoV-2: Fitness Costs Virulence?,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is continuously spreading worldwide at an unprecedented scale and evolved into seven clades according to GISAID where four (G, GH, GR and GV) are globally prevalent in 2020. These major predominant clades of SARS-CoV- 2 are continuously increasing COVID-19 cases worldwide; however, after an early rise in 2020, the death-case ratio has been decreasing to a plateau. G clade viruses contain four co- occurring mutations in their genome (C241T+C3037T+C14408T: RdRp.P323L+A23403G:spike.D614G). GR, GH, and GV strains are defined by the presence of these four mutations in addition to the clade-featured mutation in GGG28881- 28883AAC:N. RG203-204KR, G25563T:ORF3a.Q57H, and C22227T:spike.A222V+C28932T-N.A220V+G29645T, respectively. The research works are broadly focused on the spike protein mutations that have direct roles in receptor binding, antigenicity, thus viral transmission and replication fitness. However, mutations in other proteins might also have effects on viral pathogenicity and transmissibility. How the clade- featured mutations are linked with viral evolution in this pandemic through gearing their fitness and virulence is the main question of this study.

MethodologyWe thus proposed a hypothetical model, combining a statistical and structural bioinformatics approach, endeavors to explain this infection paradox by describing the epistatic effects of the clade-featured co-occurring mutations on viral fitness and virulence.

Results and DiscussionThe G and GR/GV clade strains represent a significant positive and negative association, respectively, with the death-case ratio (incidence rate ratio or IRR = 1.03, p <0.001 and IRR= 0.99/0.97, p < 0.001), whereas GH clade strains showed no association with the Docking analysis showed the higher infectiousness of a spike mutant through more favorable binding of G614 with the elastase-2. RdRp mutation p.P323L significantly increased genome-wide mutations (p<0.0001) since more expandable RdRp (mutant)-NSP8 interaction may accelerate replication. Superior RNA stability and structural variation at NSP3:C241T might impact upon protein or RNA interactions. Another silent 5UTR:C241T mutation might affect translational efficiency and viral packaging. These G- featured co-occurring mutations might increase the viral load, alter immune responses in host and hence can modulate intra-host genomic plasticity. An additional viroporin ORF3a:p.Q57H mutation, forming GH-clade, prevents ion permeability by cysteine (C81)- histidine (H57) inter-transmembrane-domain interaction mediated tighter constriction of the channel pore and possibly reduces viral release and immune response. GR strains, four G clade mutations and N:p.RG203-204KR, would have stabilized RNA interaction by more flexible and hypo-phosphorylated SR-rich region. GV strains seemingly gained the evolutionary advantage of superspreading event through confounder factors; nevertheless, N:p.A220V might affect RNA binding.

ConclusionThese hypotheses need further retrospective and prospective studies to understand detailed molecular and evolutionary events featuring the fitness and virulence of SARS-CoV-2.

113,Heterogeneity in COVID-19 severity patterns among age-gender groups: an analysis of 778 692 Mexican patients through a meta-clustering technique,"ObjectiveTo describe COVID-19 subphenotypes regarding severity patterns including prognostic, ICU and morbimortality outcomes, through stratification based on gender and age groups, as described by inter-patient variability patterns in clinical phenotypes and demographic features.

Materials and methodsWe used the COVID-19 open data from the Mexican Government including patient-level epidemiological and clinical data from 778 692 SARS-CoV-2 patients from January 13, 2020 to September 30, 2020.

Inter-patient variability was analyzed by combining dimensionality reduction and hierarchical clustering methods. We produced cluster analyses for all combinations of gender and age groups (<18, 18-49, 50-64, and >64). For each group, the optimum number of clusters was selected combining a quantitative approach using the Silhouette coefficient, and a qualitative approach through a subgroup expert inspection via visual analytics. Using the features of the resultant age-gender clusters, we performed a meta-clustering analysis to provide an overall description of the population.

ResultsWe observed a total of 56 age-gender clusters, grouped in 11 clinically distinguishable meta-clusters with different outcomes. Meta-clusters 1 to 3 showed the highest recovery rates (90.27-95.22%). These clusters include: (1) healthy patients of all ages, (2) children with comorbidities who had priority in medical resources, (3) young patients with obesity and smoking habit. Meta-clusters 4 and 5 showed moderate recovery rates (81.3-82.81%): (4) patients with hypertension or diabetes of all ages, (5) typical obese patients with three highly correlated conditions, namely, pneumonia, hypertension and diabetes. Meta-clusters 6 to 11 had very low recovery rates (53.96-66.94%) which include: (6) immunosuppressed patients with the highest comorbidity rate in many diseases, (7) CKD patients with the worse survival length and recovery, (8) elderly smoker with mild COPD, (9) severe diabetic elderly with hypertension, (10, 11) oldest obese smokers with severe COPD and mild cardiovascular disease with the latter (11) showing a relatively higher age and smoke rate, severe COPD and shorter survival length, reinforcing a high correlation between smoking habit and COPD among elderly. Additionally, the source Mexican state and type of clinical institution proved to be an important factor for heterogeneity in severity.

DiscussionThe proposed unsupervised learning approach successfully uncovered discriminative COVID-19 severity patterns for both genders and all age groups from clinical phenotypes and demographic features. A careful read of group outcomes showed consistent results regarding recent literature. Regarding the Mexican population, our results suggest that habits and comorbidities may play a key role in predicting mortality in older patients. Centenarians tended to fall in the groups with better outcomes repeatedly. Additionally, immunosuppression was not found as a relevant factor for severity alone but did when present along with chronic kidney disease. Further useful correlations could be found by evaluating the duration of unhealthy habits, demographic features, comorbidities, the time since diagnosis, recovery progress, readmission record, and the effect of source variability.

ConclusionThe resultant eleven meta-clusters provide bases to comprehend the classification of patients with COVID-19 based on comorbidities, habits, demographic characteristics, geographic data and type of clinical institutions, as well as revealing the correlations between the above characteristics thereby help to anticipate the possible clinical outcomes for every specifically characterized patient. These subphenotypes can establish target groups for automated stratification or triage systems to provide personalized therapies or treatments.

Given the olfactory impairment associated with COVID-19 3-7 , we developed a novel measure of olfactory perception that relies on smelling household odorants and rating them online. We tested the performance of this real-time tool in 12,020 participants from 134 countries who provided 171,500 perceptual ratings of 60 different household odorants. We observed that olfactory ratings were indicative of COVID-19 status in a country, significantly correlating with national infection rates over time. More importantly, we observed remarkable indicative power at the individual level (90% sensitivity and 80% specificity). Critically, olfactory testing remained highly effective in participants with COVID-19 but without symptoms, and in participants with symptoms but without COVID-19.

115,REACT-1 round 9 interim report: downward trend of SARS-CoV-2 in England inFebruary 2021 but still at high prevalence,"Background and MethodsEngland entered its third national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic on 6th January 2021 with the aim of reducing the daily number of deaths and pressure on healthcare services. The real-time assessment of community transmission study (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from randomly selected people in England in order to describe patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Here, we report data from round 9a of REACT-1 for swabs collected between 4th and 13th February 2021.

ResultsOut of 85,473 tested-swabs, 378 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.51%, a fall of more than two thirds since our last report (round 8) in January 2021 when 1.57% of people tested positive. We estimate a halving time of 14.6 days and a reproduction number R of 0.72, based on the difference in prevalence between the end of round 8 and the beginning of round 9. Although prevalence fell in all nine regions of England over the same period, there was greater uncertainty in the trend for North West, North East, and Yorkshire and The Humber. Prevalence fell substantially across all age groups with highest prevalence among 18- to 24-year olds at 0.89% (0.47%, 1.67%) and those aged 5 to12 years at 0.86% (0.60%, 1.24%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Healthcare and care home workers were more likely to test positive compared to other workers.

ConclusionsThere is a strong decline in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England among the general population five to six weeks into lockdown, but prevalence remains high: at levels similar to those observed in late September 2020. Also, the number of COVID-19 cases in hospitals is higher than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020. The effects of easing of social distancing when we transition out of lockdown need to be closely monitored to avoid a resurgence in infections and renewed pressure on health services.",Steven Riley; Caroline E.

116,Modeling the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under non-pharmaceutical interventions,"Social and behavioral non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and travel restrictions, as well as diagnostic tests, have been broadly implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiological models and data analysis affirm that wide adoption of NPIs helps to control the pandemic. However, SARS-CoV-2 has extensively demonstrated its ability to evolve. Therefore, it is crucial to examine how NPIs may affect the evolution of the virus. Such evolution could have important effects on the spread and impact of the pandemic.

We used evo-epidemiological models to examine the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions and testing on two evolutionary trajectories for SARS-CoV-2: attenuation and test evasion. Our results show that when stronger measures are taken, selection may act to reduce virulence. Additionally, the timely application of NPIs could significantly affect the competition between viral strains, favoring reduced virulence. Furthermore, a higher testing rate can select for a test-evasive viral strain, even if that strain is less infectious than the detectable competing strain. Importantly, if a less detectable strain evolves, epidemiological metrics such as confirmed daily cases may distort our assessment of the pandemic. Our results highlight the important implications NPIs can have on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",Yael Gurevich; Yoav Ram; Lilach Hadany,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252133,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252133,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
117,Self-testing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection with rapid antigen tests.,"IntroductionSelf-testing for COVID-19 infection with lateral flow assay SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection tests (RDT), provides rapid results and could enable frequent and extensive testing in the community, thereby improving the control of SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of self-testing using RDT without assistance.

MethodsParticipants visiting a municipal SARS-CoV-2 testing centre, received self-testing kits containing either the BD Veritor System (BD RDT) or Roche SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test (Roche RDT). Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the participants for qRT-PCR testing. As a proxy for contagiousness, viral culture was performed on a selection of qRT-PCR positive samples to determine the Ct-value at which the chance of a positive culture was dropping below 0.5 (Ct-value cut-off). Sensitivity and specificity of self-testing were compared to qRT-PCR with a Ct-value below the Ct value cut-off. Determinants independently associated with a false-negative self-test result were determined.

ResultsA total of 3,215 participants were included (BD RDT n=1604; Roche RDT n=1611). Sensitivity and specificity of self-testing compared to the qRT-PCR results with Ct-value below the Ct-value cut-off was 78.0% (95% CI:72.5-82.8) and 99.4% (95%CI: 99.0-99.6) respectively. Determinants independently associated with a false-negative self-testing results were: higher age, low viral load and finding self-testing difficult.

DiscussionSelf-testing using currently available RDTs has a high specificity and relatively high sensitivity to identify individuals with a high probability of contagiousness. The performance of two tests were comparable. This application has the potential for frequent and extensive testing which may be an aid to lift restrictions to society while controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",Joep J.J.M. Stohr; Vivian F.

118,An allele-specific primer extension assay to quantify the proportion of B.1.1.7-specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has claimed millions of lives globally to date. Rapid accumulation of co-occurring mutations has led to the emergence of viral variants which appear to be more transmissible, virulent, or both. Variants of concern (VOC) now include those belonging to the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages. Early detection of VOC and the ability to retrospectively follow their respective, longitudinal prevalence in communities is wanting. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) allows tracking of disease prevalence in the general population using RT-qPCR to detect viral fragments, but ongoing longitudinal studies have yet to differentiate between these variants. Here, we describe and validate a primer extension strategy to amplify and distinguish B.1.1.7-specific, from non-B.1.1.7 alleles by combining new forward, and existing CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 qPCR probes and reverse primers. This assay can be quickly implemented within a current SARS-CoV-2 WBE framework with minimal cost with the goal of providing early detection of increasing B.1.1.7 transmission in a community prior to identification through clinical testing and confirmation via secondary screening strategies. As such, this assay can provide public health units with an additional and much needed metric to be able to rapidly triangulate B.1.1.7 prevalence.",Tyson E Graber; Elisabeth Mercier; Patrick M D'Aoust; Huy-Dung Hoang; Xin Tian; Syeda Tasneem; Kamya Bhatnagar; Robert Delatolla,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252041,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252041,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
119,The early dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Portugal,"BackgroundGenomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal was rapidly implemented by the National Institute of Health in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, in collaboration with more than 50 laboratories distributed nationwide. This unprecedented collaborative effort culminated in the generation of 1275 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, which represent 15.5% of all confirmed cases in March 2020, making Portugal one of the countries generating the highest volumes of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data during early COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe reconstructed and characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and early dissemination in Portugal using recent phylodynamic models that allow integration of individual-based travel history, in order to obtain a more realistic reconstruction of the viral dynamics.

ResultsWe detected at least 277 independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions, mostly from European countries (namely the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Italy and Switzerland), which was broadly consistent with the available travel history data, as well as with the countries with most frequent connectivity and/or with the highest number of Portuguese immigrants. Although most introductions were estimated to have occurred during the last week of February and the first week of March 2020, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 was silently circulating in Portugal several weeks before the first confirmed local cases on March 2, 2020.

Discussion and ConclusionWhile the implemented preventive and early control measures seem to have been successful in mitigating community transmission from most independent introductions, our results suggest that their earlier implementation could have largely minimized the number of introductions and subsequent virus expansion. Here we lay the foundation for genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal, and highlight the need for systematic, continuous and geographically-representative genomic surveillance to guide national and international public health authorities toward the characterization and control of SARS-CoV-2 circulating diversity.",Vitor Borges; Joana Isidro; Nidia S Trovao; Silvia Duarte; Helena Cortes-Martins; Hugo Martiniano; Isabel Gordo; Ricardo Leite; Luis Vieira; - Portuguese network for SARS-CoV-2 genomics (Consortium); Raquel Guiomar; Joao Paulo Gomes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252216,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252216,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
120,Temporal and geographical variation of COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rate in Brazil,"BackgroundPrevious studies have shown that COVID-19 In-Hospital Fatality Rate (IHFR) varies between regions and has been diminishing over time. It is believed that the continuous improvement in the treatment of patients, age group of hospitalized, and the availability of hospital resources might be affecting the temporal and regional variation of IHFR. In this study, we explored how the IHFR varied over time and among age groups and federative states in Brazil. In addition, we also assessed the relationship between hospital structure availability and peaks of IHFR.

MethodsA retrospective analysis of all COVID-19 hospitalizations with confirmed outcomes in 22 states between March 01 and September 22, 2020 (n=345,281) was done. We fit GLM binomial models with additive and interaction effects between age groups, epidemiological weeks, and states. We also evaluated the association between the modeled peak of IHFR in each state and the variables of hospital structure using the Spearman rank correlation test.

ResultsWe found that the temporal variation of the IHFR was heterogeneous among the states, and in general it followed the temporal trends in hospitalizations. In addition, the peak of IHFR was higher in states with a smaller number of doctors and intensivists, and in states in which a higher percentage of people relied on the Public Health System (SUS) for medical care.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that the pressure over the healthcare system is affecting the temporal trends of IHFR in Brazil.

Key MessagesO_LITemporal variation of age adjusted In-Hospital Fatality Rate (IHFR) was markedly heterogeneous among Brazilian states from March to September of 2020.
C_LIO_LIIn several states, the IHFR increased in association with the increase in the number of hospitalizations, which suggests that the overload of the healthcare system might be affecting the temporal trends of IHFR in Brazil.
C_LIO_LIThe IHFR remained low in the states with higher rates of hospital resources, even with the high demand for hospitalization.
C_LIO_LIThe number of doctors and intensivist physicians per habitant was more strongly correlated with the peak of IHFR in the Brazilian states than the number of ICU beds.

121,Real-time analysis of a mass vaccination effort via an Artificial Intelligence platform confirms the safety of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines,"As the COVID-19 vaccination campaign unfolds as one of the most rapid and widespread in history, it is important to continuously assess the real world safety of the FDA-authorized vaccines. Curation from large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) allows for near real-time safety evaluations that were not previously possible. Here, we advance context- and sentiment-aware deep neural networks over the multi-state Mayo Clinic enterprise (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin) for automatically curating the adverse effects mentioned by physicians in over 108,000 EHR clinical notes between December 1st 2020 to February 8th 2021. We retrospectively compared the clinical notes of 31,069 individuals who received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine to those of 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who were propensity matched by demographics, residential location, and history of prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. We find that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were seen in the the clinic at similar rates within 21 days of the first or second actual or assigned vaccination dose (first dose Odds Ratio = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09-1.16; second dose Odds Ratio = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Further, the incidence rates of all surveyed adverse effects were similar or lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals after either vaccine dose. Finally, the most frequently documented adverse effects within 7 days of each vaccine dose were arthralgia (Dose 1: 0.59%; Dose 2: 0.39%), diarrhea (Dose 1: 0.58%; Dose 2: 0.33%), erythema (Dose 1: 0.51%; Dose 2: 0.31%), myalgia (Dose 1: 0.40%; Dose 2: 0.34%), and fever (Dose 1: 0.27%; Dose 2: 0.31%). These remarkably low frequencies of adverse effects recorded in EHRs versus those derived from active solicitation during clinical trials (arthralgia: 24-46%; erythema: 9.5-14.7%; myalgia: 38-62%; fever: 14.2-15.5%) emphasize the rarity of vaccine-associated adverse effects requiring clinical attention. This rapid and timely analysis of vaccine-related adverse effects from contextually rich EHR notes of 62,138 individuals, which was enabled through a large scale Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered platform, reaffirms the safety and tolerability of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in practice.",Reid McMurry; Patrick J Lenehan; Samir Awasthi; Eli Silvert; Arjun Puranik; Colin Pawlowski; AJ Venkatakrishnan; Praveen Anand; Vineet Agarwal; John C OHoro; Gregory J Gores; Amy W Williams; Andrew D Badley; John Halamka; Abinash Virk; Melanie D Smith; Katie Carlson; Deeksha Doddahonnaiah; Anna Metzger; Nikhil Kayal; Gabi Berner; Eshwan Ramudu; Corinne Carpenter; Tyler Wagner; Ajit Rajasekharan; Venky Soundararajan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252134,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252134,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
122,Wastewater Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 from Acute Care Hospitals Identifies Nosocomial Transmission and Outbreaks,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 has been detected in wastewater and its abundance correlated with community COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. We sought to use wastewater-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assess the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals.

MethodsBetween August and December 2020, twice-weekly wastewater samples from three tertiary-care hospitals (totaling >2100 dedicated inpatient beds) were collected. Wastewater samples were concentrated and cleaned using the 4S-silica column method and assessed for SARS-CoV-2 gene-targets (N1, N2 and E) and controls using RT-qPCR. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 as measured by quantification cycle (Cq), genome copies and genomes normalized to the fecal biomarker PMMoV were compared to the total daily number of patients hospitalized with active COVID-19, confirmed cases of hospital-acquired infection, and the occurrence of unit-specific outbreaks.

ResultsOf 165 wastewater samples collected, 159 (96%) were assayable. The N1-gene from SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 64.1% of samples, N2 in 49.7% and E in 10%. N1 and N2 in wastewater increased over time both in terms of amount of detectable virus and the proportion of samples that were positive, consistent with increasing hospitalizations (Pearsons r=0.679, P<0.0001, Pearsons r=0.728, P<0.0001, respectively). Despite increasing hospitalizations through the study period, wastewater analysis was able to identify incident nosocomial-acquired cases of COVID-19 (Pearsons r =0.389, P<0.001) and unit-specific outbreaks by increases in detectable SARS-CoV-2 N1-RNA (median 112 copies/ml) versus outbreak-free periods (0 copies/ml; P<0.0001).

ConclusionsWastewater-based monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising tool for SARS-CoV-2 passive surveillance and case identification, containment, and mitigation in acute-care medical facilities.

123,Multicenter cohort study of children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundA cohort study was conducted to describe and compare the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized children in three countries.

MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort of consecutive children admitted to 15 hospitals (13 in Canada and one each in Iran and Costa Rica) up to November 16, 2020. Cases were included if they had SARS-CoV-2 infection or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 or positive SARS-CoV-2 serology.

ResultsOf 211 included cases (Canada N=95; Costa Rica N=84; Iran N=32), 103 (49%) had a presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 or MIS-C at admission while 108 (51%) were admitted with other diagnoses. Twenty-one (10%) of 211 met criteria for MIS-C. Eighty-seven (41%) had comorbidities. Children admitted in Canada were older than those admitted to non-Canadian sites (median 4.1 versus 2.2 years; p<0.001) and less likely to require mechanical ventilation (3/95 [3%] versus 15/116 [13%]; p<0.05). Sixty-four of 211 (30%) required supplemental oxygen or intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 4 (1.9%) died. Age < 30 days, admission outside Canada, presence of at least one comorbidity and chest imaging compatible with COVID-19 predicted severe or critical COVID-19 (defined as death or need for supplemental oxygen or ICU admission).

ConclusionsApproximately half of hospitalized children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C were admitted with other suspected diagnoses. Disease severity was higher at non-Canadian sites. Neonates, children with comorbidities and those with chest radiographs compatible with COVID-19 were at increased risk for severe or critical COVID-19.

124,COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in Underserved Communities of North Carolina,"BackgroundIn the United States, underserved communities including Blacks and Latinx are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and widespread vaccination is critical for curbing this pandemic. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, describe attitudes related to vaccination, and identify correlates among racial minority and marginalized populations across 9 counties in North Carolina.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire distributed at free COVID-19 testing events in underserved rural and urban communities from August 27 - December 15, 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as the response of ""no"" or ""dont know/not sure"" to whether the participant would get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it became available.

ResultsThe sample comprised 948 participants including 27.7% Whites, 59.6% Blacks, 12.7% Latinx, and 63% female. Thirty-two percent earned <$20K annually, 60% owned a computer and [~]80% had internet access at home. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 68.9% including 62.7%, 74%, and 59.5% among Whites, Blacks, and Latinx, respectively. Between September and December, the largest decline in vaccine hesitancy occurred among Whites (27.5 percentage points), followed by Latinx (17.6) and the smallest decline was among Black respondents (12.0). 51.2% of the respondents reported vaccine safety concerns, 23.7% wanted others to get of the respondents reported they would trust health care providers with information about the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with hesitancy in multivariable logistic regression included being female (OR=1.90 95%CI[1.36, 2.64]), being Black (OR=1.68 [1.106 2.45]), calendar month (OR=0.76 [0.63, 0.92]), safety concerns (OR=4.28 [3.06, 5.97]), and government distrust (OR=3.57 [2.26, 5.63]).

ConclusionsThis study reached underserved minority populations in a number of different locations to investigate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We built on existing relationships and further engaged the community, stake holders and health department to provide free COVID-19 testing. This direct approach permitted assessment of vaccine hesitancy (which was much higher than national estimates), distrust, and safety concerns.

HighlightsO_LIThis study surveyed 948 adults at COVID-19 testing sites in 9 counties of North Carolina between August 27 and December 15, 2020 where vaccine hesitancy was widespread including 74% in Blacks, 62.7% in Whites and 59.5% in Latinx.
C_LIO_LIVaccine hesitancy declined over time but remained high for Blacks.
C_LIO_LIOn-site surveys conducted in underserved areas that were paper-based and self-administered permitted reaching adults with no internet (17%), no cell phone (20%), no computer (40%) and yearly incomes less than 20K (31%).
C_LIO_LIWidespread vaccine hesitancy in predominately minority communities of NC must be addressed to successfully implement mass COVID-19 vaccination programs.

125,A Prospective Clinical Evaluation of a Patient Isolation Hood During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundHealthcare workers have frequently become infected with SARS-CoV-2 whilst treating patients with COVID-19. A variety of novel devices have been proposed to reduce COVID-19 cross contamination.

ObjectiveTo test whether a novel patient isolation hood was safe and comfortable, and could potentially reduce HCW COVID-19 infections.

MethodsProspective cohort study of 20 patients, entailing staff/patient questionnaires, and safety aspects of prototype isolation hoods.Prospective collection of HCW COVID-19 data.Assessment of the hoods safety and practicality, and adverse event reporting.

Outcome MeasuresQuestionnaires responses, adverse events reporting, rates of HCW infections during study period (20/6/2020 -21/7/2020).HCW COVID-19 infections reported until last recorded HCW COVID-19 diagnosis (20/6/2020 -27/9/2020).

ResultsOf the 60 (of 64) eligible individual staff surveys, 60 favoured isolation hood use.Staff were unanimous in: perceiving the hood as safe (60/60), preferring its use (56/56), and understanding its potential COVID-19 cross-contamination minimisation (60/60). All eight patients who completed the questionnaire thought the isolation hood helped prevent COVID-19 cross-infection, was safe, and comfortable. There were no reported patient safety adverse events. The overall attack COVID-19 attack rate from 20/6/2020-27/9/2020 among registered nurses was 3.4% (102/2994): ICUs 2.2% (3/138), Geriatric wards 13.2% (26/197), and COVID-19 Wards 18.3% (32/175). The COVID-19 attack rate among medical staff was: all junior medical staff 2.1% (24/932), senior medical staff 0.7% (4/607), aged care/rehabilitation 6.7% (2/30), and ICU all medical staff 8.6% (3/35).

126,Human basigin (CD147) does not directly interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein,"Basigin, or CD147, has been reported as a co-receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to invade host cells. Basigin also has a well-established role in Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection of human erythrocytes where it is bound by one of the parasites invasion ligands, reticulocyte binding protein homolog 5 (RH5). Here, we sought to validate the claim that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein can form a complex with basigin, using RH5-basigin as a positive control. Using recombinantly expressed proteins, size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance, we show that neither RBD nor full-length spike glycoprotein bind to recombinant human basigin (either expressed in E. coli or mammalian cells). Given the immense interest in SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic targets, we would caution the inclusion of basigin in this list on the basis of its reported direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.

ImportanceReducing the mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 remains a global health priority. Critical to these efforts is the identification of host factors that are essential to viral entry and replication. Basigin, or CD147, was previously identified as a possible therapeutic target based on the observation that it may act as a co-receptor for SARS-COV-2, binding to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Here, we show that there is no direct interaction between the RBD and basigin, casting doubt on its role as a co-receptor and plausibility as a therapeutic target.",Robert James Ragotte; David Pulido; Francesca R Donnellan; Giacomo Gorini; Hannah Davies; Juliane Brun; Lloyd DW King; Katherine Skinner; Simon J Draper,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432402,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432402,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,False

Here we describe development and validation of a simple but accurate scoring tool to classify risk of hospitalization and mortality.

MethodsAll consecutive patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March 25-October 1, 2020 within the Intermountain Healthcare system were included. The cohort was randomly divided into 70% derivation and 30% validation cohorts. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for 14-day hospitalization. The optimal model was then adapted to a simple, probabilistic score and applied to the validation cohort and evaluated for prediction of hospitalization and 28-day mortality.

Results22,816 patients were included; mean age was 40 years, 50.1% were female and 44% identified as non-white race or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. 6.2% required hospitalization and 0.4% died. Criteria in the simple model included: age (0.5 points per decade); high-risk comorbidities (2 points each): diabetes mellitus, severe immunocompromised status and obesity (body mass index[&ge;]30); non-white race/Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity (2 points), and 1 point each for: male sex, dyspnea, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrythmia, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic neurologic disease. In the derivation cohort (n=16,030) area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.84) for hospitalization and 0.91 (0.83-0.94) for 28-day mortality; in the validation cohort (n=6,786) AUROC for hospitalization was 0.8 (CI 0.78-0.82) and for mortality 0.8 (CI 0.69-0.9).

ConclusionA prediction score based on widely available patient attributes accurately risk stratifies patients with COVID-19 at the time of testing.

128,Modelling the Impact of Delaying Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2 Assuming Unlimited Vaccines Supply,"BackgroundAt the moment we have more than 109 million cases and 2.4 million deaths around the world and vaccination represents the only hope to control the pandemic. Imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, however, have hampered the control of the virus so far.

MethodsWe propose a new mathematical model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against COVID-19 on the number of cases and deaths by the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. We simulated the model for the populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations.

ResultsThe model projects that, in the absence of vaccination, almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths until the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively. In addition, that for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically in a logarithm fashion, for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole.

ConclusionsOur model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules that is observed in many countries has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time.",Eduardo Massad; Marcos Amaku; Dimas Tadeu Covas; Raymundo Soares de azevedo Neto; Francisco Antonio Bezerra Coutinho,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252189,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252189,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
129,An efficient benchmark for COVID-19 pandemic testing effectiveness,"Testing for COVID-19 is an important tool that health administrations dispose to adequately monitor and respond to the pandemic, but it is still unclear at which point the number and strategies of testing become effective for these purposes. The percentage of tests that return a positive result is a metric currently used both as a benchmark of testing adequacy and for assessing the viral spread. However, since the former is a prerequisite for the latter, the interpretation is often conflicting, especially during times of testing scaling-up, or during phases of increasing viral spread. We propose as a benchmark for COVID-19 testing effectiveness a simple metric that creates a link between the cases detected and tests performed, with specific observable outcomes that are actively being monitored in most countries, such as the number of new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and the number of deaths in the community. This new metric, named  Severity Detection Rate, or SDR, represents the current number of daily needs for new ICU admissions, per 100 cases detected (t-i) days ago, per 10,000 tests performed (t-i) days ago. Based on the announced COVID-19 monitoring data in Greece from May 2020 until end of January 2021, we show that beyond a threshold of daily testing number, SDR reaches a plateau of weak variability that begins to reflect testing adequacy. Because of this stabilization, it was possible to predict with great accuracy the daily needs for new ICU admissions, 12 days ahead of each testing data point, over a period of 6 months that included the second wave of the pandemic in the country, with Pearson r = 0.99 (p = 10-180), RMSE = 4,34. We suggest the further study of the metric with data from more countries in order to confirm the proposed functionality and utility.",Dimitris Nikoloudis; Dimitrios Kountouras; Asimina Hiona,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252138,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252138,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
130,Impact of environmental temperature on Covid-19 spread: Model and analysis of measurements recorded during the second pandemic in Cyprus,"The paper investigates the effect of the environmental temperature on the spread of COVID-19. We study the daily numbers of the cases infected and deaths caused by Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic within 2020, and how they were affected by the daily average-high temperature for the districts of the Republic of Cyprus. Among the findings of the paper, we show that (i) the average ratio of the PCR to rapid positive tests is [~]2.57{+/-}0.25, as expected from the tests responses, indicating that PCR overestimates positivity by [~]2.5 times; (ii) the average age of deaths caused by Covid-19 increases with rate about a year of age per week; (iii) the probability of a person infected by Covid-19 to develop severe symptoms leading to death is strongly depended on the persons age, while the probability of having a death on the age of [~]67 or younger is less than 1/1000; (iv) the number of infected cases and deaths declined dramatically when the environmental temperature reaches and/or climbs above the critical temperature of TC=30.1{+/-}2.4 C0; (v) the observed negative correlation between the exponential growth rate of the infected cases and the environmental temperature can be described within the framework of chemical kinetics, with at least two competing reactions, the connection of the coronavirus towards the receptor and the dissolution of the coronavirus; the estimated activation energy difference corresponding to the competing chemical reactions, 0.212{+/-}0.25 eV, matches the known experimental value; and (vi) the infected cases will decline to zero, when the environmental temperature climbs above the critical temperature within the summery days of 2021, which is expected for the Republic of Cyprus by the 16th of May, 2021.",George Livadiotis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252106,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252106,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
131,Vaccination efforts in Brazil: scenarios and perspectives under a mathematical modeling approach,"An agent-based model is proposed to access the impact of vaccination strategies to halt the COVID-19 spread. The model is parameterized using data from Sao Paulo State, Brazil. It was considered the two vaccines that are already approved for emergency use in Brazil, the CoronaVac vaccine developed by the Chinese bio-pharmaceutical company Sinovac and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (ChadOx1) developed by Oxford University and the British laboratory AstraZeneca. Both of them are two-dose schemes, but the efficacy and the interval between doses are different. We found that even in the worst scenario, in which the vaccine does not prevent infection either severe symptoms, the number of deaths decreases from 122 to 99 for CoronaVac application and to 80 for ChadOx1 administration. The same patterns have been seen in hospitalizations. Nevertheless, we show that when a low risk perception occurs, the reduction values decrease between 2% to 4%. Moreover, the increase of disease prevalence also jeopardizes immunization, showing the importance of the mitigation measures maintenance. On the other hand, doubling the vaccination rate would be able to significantly decrease the disease outcomes, reducing deaths by up to 74.4%. In conclusion, vaccination, along with non-pharmaceutical measures, is key to the control of COVID-19 in Brazil.",Thomas Nogueira Vilches; Felipe Alves Rubio; Rafael Forti Perroni; Gabriel Berg de Almeida; Claudia Pio Ferreira; Carlos Magno Castelo Branco Fortaleza,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252208,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252208,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
132,"Factors Associated with Timely Test Seeking, Test Turnaround, and Public Reporting of COVID-19: a retrospective analysis in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundMinimizing delays in disease identification and reporting improves the timeliness of surveillance data, and can reduce transmission of COVID-19. Our study investigates factors associated with timely testing and reporting of COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave in one province of Canada.

MethodsWe identified all persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection residing in private households across the largest province of Canada, Ontario from the date of the first confirmed case in Ontario (January 25) to July 19, 2020. Our primary outcomes consisted of: (1) specimen collection within 1 day of symptom onset (test seeking), (2) test result reported to local public health within 1 day of specimen collection (test turnaround), and (3) entry of case data into the provincial database within 1 day of reporting test results (reporting). We examined 14 covariates including eight case characteristics, and six neighborhood characteristics. In addition to descriptive measures, logistic regression models were fitted. Unadjusted models included the covariate alone, while adjusted models included age, gender, month, and region.

FindingsAmong 27,198 COVID-19 cases from January 25 2020 to July 19 2020, 28{middle dot}7% had timely test seeking, 40{middle dot}2% had timely test turnaround, and 75{middle dot}5% had timely reporting. Male gender had lower odds of timely test seeking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0{middle dot}79 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}85]) compared to females. Healthcare worker status (aOR 2{middle dot}77 [95% CI: 2{middle dot}52-3{middle dot}05] compared to non-healthcare workers), and age [&ge;]80 years (aOR 1{middle dot}59 [95% CI: 1{middle dot}33-1{middle dot}91] compared to 40-59 year olds) were associated with timely test seeking. Specimen collection on Fridays and Saturdays (aOR 0{middle dot}88 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}79-0{middle dot}98], aOR 0{middle dot}83 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}92] respectively, compared to Wednesdays) had lower odds of timely test turnaround. Urban areas (aOR 1{middle dot}55 [95% CI: 1{middle dot}41-1{middle dot}70] compared to rural areas) were associated with timely test turnaround. Urban areas (aOR 0{middle dot}79 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}89] compared to rural areas) were less likely to have timely reporting.

InterpretationIndividual, neighborhood, and administrative factors are associated with timely testing and reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These findings present considerations for developing targeted strategies to minimize delays and improve timely testing and reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

FundingThis study was funded by Public Health Ontario.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and medRxiv up to November 30 2020 to identify studies examining the impact of delays in the disease reporting process on the public health response to COVID-19. We used the search terms (""2019-nCoV"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""delays"" OR ""timely"" OR ""reporting"" OR ""test"" OR ""turnaround""), and reviewed reference lists of any relevant articles in the original search. Numerous modeling studies have highlighted the importance of timely testing and reporting to effectively control the spread of COVID-19. Additional studies have also identified delays of only 1 day in testing were associated with increased risk of secondary transmission within households. However no study has described the multiple delays in the disease reporting process of COVID-19 and examined factors associated with timely disease reporting using a large population cohort.

Added value of this studyOur study described timely test seeking, test turnaround, and reporting for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada and identified associated individual, neighbourhood, and administrative factors. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe detailed delays in the disease reporting process of COVID-19 and identified associated factors using a large population cohort.

Implications of all the available evidenceNumerous individual, neighborhood, and administrative characteristics are associated with timely testing and reporting of COVID-19. These identified factors may be used to develop strategies such as broadened test access, prioritization of vulnerable populations, and increased testing capacity to reduce delays in testing and reporting and improve the effectiveness of public health response to COVID-19.",Eugene Joh; Sarah A Buchan; Nick Daneman; Lauren A Paul; Kevin A Brown,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252219,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252219,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True

134,A rapid review of equity considerations in large-scale testing campaigns during infectious disease epidemics,"ContextLarge-scale testing is an intervention that is instrumental for infectious disease control and a central tool for the COVID-19 pandemic. Our rapid review aimed to identify if and how equity has been considered in large-scale testing initiatives.

MethodsWe searched Web of Science and PubMed in November 2020 and followed PRISMA recommendations for scoping reviews. Articles were analyzed using descriptive and thematic analysis.

ResultsOur search resulted in 291 studies of which 41 were included for data extraction after full article screening. Most of the included articles (83%) reported on HIV-related screening programs, while the remaining programs focused on other sexually transmitted infections (n=3) or COVID-19 (n=4). None of the studies presented a formal definition of (in)equity in testing, however, 23 articles did indirectly include elements of equity in the program or intervention design, largely through the justification of their target population.

ConclusionThe studies included in our rapid review did not explicitly consider equity in their design or evaluation. It is imperative that equity is incorporated into the design of infectious disease testing programs and serves as an important reminder of how equity considerations are needed for SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination programs.",Katarina Ost; Louise Duquesne; Claudia Duguay; Lola Traverson; Isadora Mathevet; Valery Ridde; Kate Zinszer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252205,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21252205,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
135,SARS-CoV-2 causes brain inflammation and induces Lewy body formation in macaques,"SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute respiratory disease, but the infection can also initiate neurological symptoms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes brain inflammation in the macaque model. An increased metabolic activity in the pituitary gland of two macaques was observed by longitudinal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Post-mortem analysis demonstrated infiltration of T-cells and activated microglia in the brain, and viral RNA was detected in brain tissues from one animal. We observed Lewy bodies in brains of all rhesus macaques. These data emphasize the virus capability to induce neuropathology in this nonhuman primate model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. As in humans Lewy body formation is an indication for the development of Parkinsons disease, this data represents a warning for potential long-term neurological effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

136,Increased complement activation is a distinctive feature of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Complement activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it remains to be determined whether increased complement activation is a broad indicator of critical illness (and thus, no different in COVID-19). It is also unclear which pathways are contributing to complement activation in COVID-19, and, if complement activation is associated with certain features of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as endothelial injury and hypercoagulability. To address these questions, we investigated complement activation in the plasma from patients with COVID-19 prospectively enrolled at two tertiary care centers. We compared our patients to two non-COVID cohorts: (a) patients hospitalized with influenza, and (b) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We demonstrate that circulating markers of complement activation (i.e., sC5b-9) are elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza and to patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory failure. Further, the results facilitate distinguishing those who are at higher risk of worse outcomes such as requiring ICU admission, or IMV. Moreover, the results indicate enhanced activation of the alternative complement pathway is most prevalent in patients with severe COVID-19 and is associated with markers of endothelial injury (i.e., Ang2) as well as hypercoagulability (i.e., thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor). Our findings identify complement activation to be a distinctive feature of COVID-19, and provide specific targets that may be utilized for risk prognostication, drug discovery and personalized clinical trials.

SUMMMARYComplement has been implicated in COVID-19. However, whether this is distinctive of COVID-19 remains unanswered.

137,"At the Intersection Between SARS-CoV-2, Macrophages and the Adaptive Immune Response: A Key Role for Antibody-Dependent Pathogenesis But Not Enhancement of Infection in COVID-19","Since entering the world stage in December of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has impacted every corner of the globe with over 1.48 million deaths and caused untold economic damage. Infections in humans range from asymptomatic to severe disease associated with dysregulation of the immune system leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs).

The distinct shift in peripheral monocyte activation and infiltration of these cells into the respiratory tract in ARDs patients suggests severe COVID-19 may largely result from damage to the respiratory epithelia by improperly activated macrophages. Here, we present evidence that dysregulation of the immune response in COVID-19 begins with activation of macrophages by non-neutralizing antibodies and induction of ACE2 expression, rendering these cells susceptible to killing by SARS-CoV-2. Death of macrophages occurs independently of viral replication and leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and modulation of the susceptibility of downstream epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2.",Jennifer K DeMarco; William Severson; Daniel DeMarco; Gregory Pogue; Jon D.

To better understand these cases, we applied a multi-parametric approach to the study of blood cells of 56 children hospitalized with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most severe forms of MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to SARS-CoV-2), that resulted in myocarditis, were characterized by elevated levels of pro-angiogenesis cytokines and several chemokines. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses identified a unique monocyte/dendritic cell gene signature that correlated with the occurrence of severe myocarditis, characterized by sustained NF-{kappa}B activity, TNF- signaling, associated with decreased gene expression of NF-{kappa}B inhibitors. We also found a weak response to type-I and type-II interferons, hyperinflammation and response to oxidative stress related to increased HIF-1 and VEGF signaling.

The purpose of this study is to examine which socioeconomic status groups are most at risk of treatment interruption.

MethodsThis cross-sectional internet monitor study was conducted on December 22-26, 2020, when Japan experienced its third wave of COVID-19 infection. Out of a total of 33,302 participants in the survey, 9510 (5392 males and 4118 females) who responded that they required regular treatment or hospital visits were included in the analysis. A multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for treatment disruption. We examined separate multivariate models for socioeconomic factors, health factors, and lifestyle factors.

ResultsDuring a period of rapid COVID-19 infection, about 11% of Japanese workers who required regular treatment experienced interruptions to their treatment. The OR of treatment interruption associated with not being married compared to being married was 1.44; manual labor work compared to desk work was 1.30; loss of employment when the COVID-19 pandemic started and continued unemployment compared to being employed over the entire pandemic period was 1.62 and 2.57, respectively; and feeling financially unstable was 2.92.

141,High-resolution longitudinal serum proteome trajectories in COVID-19 reveal patients-specific seroconversion,"Biomarkers for COVID-19 are urgently needed. Here we bring the powerful technology of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to bear on this challenge. We measured serum proteomes of COVID-19 patients and symptomatic, but PCR-negative controls, in a time-resolved manner. In 262 controls and 458 longitudinal samples (average of 31 days) of 31 patients, hospitalized for COVID-19, a remarkable 26% of proteins changed significantly. Bioinformatics analyses revealed co-regulated groups and shared biological functions. Proteins of the innate immune system such as CRP, SAA1, CD14, LBP and LGALS3BP decreased early in the time course. In contrast, regulators of coagulation (APOH, FN1, HRG, KNG1, PLG) and lipid homeostasis (APOA1, APOC1, APOC2, APOC3, PON1) increased over the course of the disease. A global correlation map provides a systems-wide functional association between proteins, biological processes and clinical chemistry parameters. Importantly, five SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays against antibodies revealed excellent correlations with an extensive range of immunoglobulin regions, which were quantified by MS-based proteomics. The high-resolution profile of all immunoglobulin regions showed individual-specific differences and commonalities of potential pathophysiological relevance.

142,"Lower respiratory tract sampling via bronchoscopy in COVID-19 ARDS - A focus on microbiology, cellular morphology, cytology and management impact","BackgroundLower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling via bronchoscopy has been done sparingly in COVID-19 ARDS due to the high aerosol risk for the health care workers (HCW). Valuable information can be gained by detailed evaluation of bronchoscopic LRT samples.

MethodsLRT samples were obtained by bedside bronchoscopy performed in suspected or confirmed severe COVID-19 ARDS patients on mechanical ventilation. Only positive cases were included in the study. Microbiological, cellular and cytological studies including LRT COVID-19 RT-PCR were performed and analysed.

Results100 samples were collected from 63 patients, 53 were males (84%). 43 patients (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity. 55% cases had secondary bacterial infection as demonstrated by positive culture. Most of these infections were due to multi-drug resistant organisms (94.5%). The most common organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii in 56.3% and 14.5% cases respectively. Fungal superinfection was observed in 9 patients (14.3%). Bronchoscopy helped confirm COVID-19 diagnosis in 1 patient and helped rule out COVID-19 in 3 patients who were eventually excluded from the study. The median BAL fluid (BALF) WBC count was 953 (IQR; 400-2717), with mean neutrophil count 85.2% ({+/-}13.9), and mean lymphocyte count 14.8% ({+/-}13.9). Repeat sampling done in some patients showed a progressive increase in the total WBC count in BALF, an increase in neutrophil percentage, and a higher chance of isolating an organism on the culture (81% repeat procedures were culture positive). The rate of super-infection increased with longer duration of illness. Patients with superinfection also had an increased WBC count (1001 vs 400), and lower lymphocyte percentage (19% vs 12% - OR - 6.8 [95%CI -14.3 - 0.7]). Bronchoscopic LRT sampling contributed significantly to modifying antibiotic coverage and discontinuing steroids in 37% cases.

ConclusionThis study describes a detailed analysis of bronchoscopic LRT sampling in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

143,Single-Particle Counting Based on Digital Plasmonic Nanobubble Detection for Rapid and Ultrasensitive Diagnostics,"Rapid and sensitive diagnostics of infectious diseases is an urgent and unmet need as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we report a novel strategy, based on DIgitAl plasMONic nanobubble Detection (DIAMOND), to address these gaps. Plasmonic nanobubbles are transient vapor bubbles generated by laser heating of plasmonic nanoparticles and allow single-particle detection. Using gold nanoparticles labels and an optofluidic setup, we demonstrate that DIAMOND achieves a compartment-free digital counting and works on homogeneous assays without separation and amplification steps. When applied to the respiratory syncytial virus diagnostics, DIAMOND is 150 times more sensitive than commercial lateral flow assays and completes measurements within 2 minutes. Our method opens new possibilities to develop single-particle digital detection methods and facilitate rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostics.

145,Structural and functional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD domains produced in mammalian cells,"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still ongoing and dramatically influences our life, the need for recombinant proteins for diagnostics, vaccine development, and research is very high. The spike (S) protein, and particularly its receptor binding domain (RBD), mediates the interaction with the ACE2 receptor on host cells and may be modulated by its structural features. Therefore, well characterized recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional posttranslational modifications) a multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic dissection and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, higher level of sialylation and a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, from both putative O-glycosylation sites, we could confirm that O-glycosylation was exclusively present at T323, which was previously unknown. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of positive patients and affinity to ACE2 receptor was addressed showing comparable results. This work not only offers insights into RBD structural and functional features but also provides a workflow for characterization of new RBDs and batch-to-batch comparison.",Christoph Gstoettner; Tao Zhang; Anja Resemann; Sophia Ruben; Stuart Pengelley; Detlev Suckau; Tim Welsink; Manfred Wuhrer; Elena Dominguez-Vega,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.432424,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.432424,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,False

ResultsThe community uptake in Abu Dhabi Emirate reached 90% (average of 68% overall). In the great majority it was self-motivated as 6% only had doctor referral. Those who had not taken a test were younger in age (p < 0.001), more likely performing activities such as shopping and eating out (p = 0.001), have a medical illness (p < 0.0001), and working from home (p = 0.005). The tested group reported significantly more agreement with the statement, if someone had negative result no need to stay home or wear mask.

147,Anti-cardiolipin and other anti-phospholipid antibodies in critically ill COVID-19 positive and negative patients,"BackgroundReports of severe COVID-19 being associated with thrombosis, anti-phospholipid antibodies (APLA), anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) have yielded disparate conclusions. Studies comparing COVID-19 patients with contemporaneous controls of similar severity are lacking.

Methods22 COVID+ and 20 COVID- patients with respiratory failure admitted to intensive care were studied longitudinally. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the day of admission. APLA testing included anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-{beta}2glycoprotien 1 ({beta}2GP1), anti-domain 1 beta2 glycoprotein 1 ({beta}2GP1) and anti-phosphatidyl serine/prothrombin complex (PS/PT). Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by immunofluorescence and antibodies to cytokines by a commercially available multiplexed array. ANOVA was used for continuous variables and Fishers exact test was used for categorical variables with =0.05 and the false discovery rate at q=0.05.

ResultsAPLA were predominantly IgG aCL (48%) followed by IgM (21%) in all patients, with a tendency toward higher frequency among the COVID+. aCL was not associated with surrogate markers of thrombosis but IgG aCL was strongly associated with worse disease severity and higher ANA titers regardless of COVID-19 status. An association between aCL and anti-cytokine autoantibodies tended to be higher among the COVID+.

ConclusionsPositive APLA serology was associated with more severe disease regardless of COVID-19 status.

An autopsy report revealed positive SARS-Cov-2 detection results in ovary, however, the developmental-stage-specific and cell-type-specific risk in fetal primordial germ cells (PGCs) and adult women ovary remained unclear. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets spanning several developmental stages of ovary including PGCs and cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) to investigate the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that PGCs and COC exhibited high ACE2 expression. More importantly, the ratio of ACE2-positive cells was sharply up-regulated in primary stage and ACE2 was expressed in all oocytes and cumulus cells in preovulatory stage, suggesting the possible risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in follicular development. CatB/L, not TMPRSS2, was identified to prime for SARS-CoV-2 entry in follicle.

149,Metagenomic diagnosis and pathogenic network profile of SARS-CoV-2 in patients co-morbidly affected by type 2 diabetes,"BackgroundThe mortality of COVID-19 disease is very high among males or elderly or individuals having comorbidities with obesity, cardiovascular diseases, lung infections, hypertension, and/or diabetes. Our study characterizes SARS-CoV-2 infected patients metagenomic features with or without type 2 diabetes to identify the microbial interactions associated with its fatal consequences.

MethodThis study compared the baseline nasopharyngeal microbiome of SARS-CoV-2 infected diabetic and non-diabetic patients with controls adjusted with age and gender. The mNGS were performed using Ion GeneStudio S5 Series and the data were analyzed by the Vegan-package in R.

ResultsAll three groups possessed significant bacterial diversity and dissimilarity indexes (p<0.05). Spearmans correlation coefficient network analysis illustrated 183 significant positive correlations and 13 negative correlations of pathogenic bacteria (r=0.6-1.0, p<0.05), and 109 positive correlations among normal-flora and probiotic bacteria (r>0.6, p<0.05). The SARS-CoV-2 diabetic group exhibited a significant increase of pathogens (p<0.05) and opportunistic pathogens (p<0.05) with a simultaneous decrease of normal-flora (p<0.05). The molecular docking analysis of Salivaricin, KLD4 (alpha), and enterocin produced by several enriched probiotic strains presented strong binding affinity with Shiga toxin, outer membrane proteins (ompA, omp33) or hemolysin.

ConclusionThe dysbiosis of the bacterial community might be linked with severe consequences of COVID-19 infected diabetic patients, although few probiotic strains inhibited numerous pathogens in the same pathological niches. This study suggested that the promotion of normal-flora and probiotics through dietary changes and reduction of excessive pro-inflammatory states by preventing pathogenic environment might lead to a better outcome for those co-morbid patients.",Hassan M.

150,Structural Basis for SARS-CoV-2 Envelope Protein in Recognition of Human Cell Junction Protein PALS1,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a global health and economic emergency. SARS-CoV-2 viruses hijack human proteins to promote their spread and virulence including the interactions involving the viral envelope (E) protein and human proteins. To understand the structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 viral-host recognition, we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine a structure for the human cell junction protein PALS1 and SARS-CoV-2 E protein complex. The structure shows that the E protein C-terminal DLLV motif recognizes a pocket formed exclusively by hydrophobic residues from the PDZ and SH3 domains in PALS1. Our structural analysis provides an explanation for the observation that the viral E protein recruits PALS1 from lung epithelial cell junctions resulting in vascular leakage, lung damage, viral spread, and virulence. In addition, our structure provides novel targets for peptide- and small-molecule inhibitors that could block the PALS1-E interactions to reduce the E-mediated damage to vascular structures.",Jin Chai; Yuanheng Cai; Changxu Pang; Liguo Wang; Sean McSweeney; John Shanklin; Qun Liu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432373,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432373,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,False
151,Using mixed-effects modeling to estimate decay kinetics of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The duration of natural immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 is a matter of some debate in the literature at present. For example, in a recent publication characterizing SARS-CoV-2 immunity over time, the authors fit pooled longitudinal data, using fitted slopes to infer the duration of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In fact, such approaches can lead to misleading conclusions as a result of statistical model-fitting artifacts. To exemplify this phenomenon, we reanalyzed one of the markers (pseudovirus neutralizing titer) in the publication, using mixed-effects modeling, a methodology better suited to longitudinal datasets like these. Our findings showed that the half-life was both longer and more variable than reported by the authors.

While vaccines have demonstrated protective efficacy, vaccine hesitancy and logistical distribution challenges will delay their ability to end the pandemic. Hence, there is a need for rapidly translatable, easy-to-administer-therapeutics, that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease progression, when administered in the early stages of infection. We demonstrate that an orally bioavailable Hsp90 inhibitor, SNX-5422, currently in clinical trials as an anti-cancer therapeutic, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro at a high selectivity index. SNX-5422 treatment of human primary airway epithelial cells dampened expression of inflammatory pathways associated with poor SARS-CoV-2 disease outcomes. Additionally, SNX-5422 interrupted expression of host factors that are crucial for SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery.

A working definition and operationalization can be helpful to characterize and communicate about epidemics. We propose a working definition of epidemic waves in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and an operationalization based on the public data of the effective reproduction number R. Our operationalization characterizes the numbers and durations of waves (upward and downward) in 178 countries and reveals patterns that can enable healthcare organizations and policymakers to make better description and assessment of the COVID crisis to make more informed resource planning, mobilization, and allocation temporally in the continued COVID-19 pandemic.

To study SARS-CoV-2 biology, we generated an atlas of 2422 human proteins vicinal to 17 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins using proximity proteomics. This identified viral proteins at specific intracellular locations, such as association of accessary proteins with intracellular membranes, and projected SARS-CoV-2 impacts on innate immune signaling, ER-Golgi transport, and protein translation. It identified viral protein adjacency to specific host proteins whose regulatory variants are linked to COVID-19 severity, including the TRIM4 interferon signaling regulator which was found proximal to the SARS-CoV-2 M protein. Viral NSP1 protein adjacency to the EIF3 complex was associated with inhibited host protein translation whereas ORF6 localization with MAVS was associated with inhibited RIG-I 2CARD-mediated IFNB1 promoter activation. Quantitative proteomics identified candidate host targets for the NSP5 protease, with specific functional cleavage sequences in host proteins CWC22 and FANCD2. This data resource identifies host factors proximal to viral proteins in living human cells and nominates pathogenic mechanisms employed by SARS-CoV-2.

Author SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the latest pathogenic coronavirus to emerge as a public health threat. We create a database of proximal host proteins to 17 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. We validate that NSP1 is proximal to the EIF3 translation initiation complex and is a potent inhibitor of translation. We also identify ORF6 antagonism of RNA-mediate innate immune signaling. We produce a database of potential host targets of the viral protease NSP5, and create a fluorescence-based assay to screen cleavage of peptide sequences.

Here, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a glycosylation reprogramming of circulating lymphocytes at diagnosis. We identified a specific glycosignature of T cells, defined upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and apparently triggered by a serological factor. This specific glycan switch of T cells is detected at diagnosis being more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. We further demonstrated that asymptomatic patients display an increased expression of a viral-sensing receptor, through the up-regulation of DC-SIGN in monocytes. We showed that higher levels of DC-SIGN in monocytes at diagnosis correlates with better COVID-19 prognosis. These new evidences pave the way to the identification of a novel glycan-based response in T cells that may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients, highlighting a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.",Ines Alves; Manuel M Vicente; Joana Gaifem; Angela Fernandes; Ana M Dias; Claudia S Rodrigues; Jose Carlos Oliveira; Nair Seixas; Luis Malheiro; Miguel A Abreu; Rui Sarmento e Castro; Salome S Pinho,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251918,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251918,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
158,"Factors influencing self-harm thoughts and self-harm behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a longitudinal analysis of 48,446 adults","BackgroundThere is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath will result in excess suicides by increasing known risk factors such as self-harm. However, evidence on how pandemic-related risk factors contribute to changes in these outcomes is lacking.

AimsWe sought to examine how different adverse experiences and worries about adversity brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the pandemic.

MethodData from 48,446 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 45 weeks (1 April to 7 February 2021) of the pandemic. Fixed effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experiences and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+ years).

ResultsMore adverse experiences were more strongly related to outcomes than worries. Specific categories of worries and adversities had stronger associations with outcomes than others. The largest contributing factor to increases in both self-harm thoughts (odds ratio (OR) range = 3.38 to 4.00) and behaviours (OR range = 3.72 to 6.82) was physical or psychological abuse amongst all ages. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes, the latter being more consistently associated with outcomes than actual financial adversity.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic, which is concerning given the link between self-harm and suicide. Policies currently place to protect and reassure citizens may be insufficient in assuaging fears and anxieties. Given the likelihood that as time goes on, the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting a variety of existing evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.",Elise Paul; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252050,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252050,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
159,SARS-CoV-2 serostatus of healthcare worker in the Austrian state Vorarlberg between June 2020 and January 2021,"BackgroundAustria, and particularly its westernmost federal state Vorarlberg, developed the highest COVID-19 incidence rate worldwide in November 2020. Health care workers (HCW) may be at higher risk of contracting the disease within the working environment and therefore the seroprevalence in this population is of particular interest. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response in Vorarlberg HCW in a prospective cohort study.

MethodsA total of 395 HCW have been tested at three different time points for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for NP and RBD. Enrollment started in June 2020 (t1), two months after the end of the first wave. Re-testing took place between October to November at the beginning of the second wave (t2), and again at the end of the second wave in January 2021(t3).

ResultsAt t1, 3% of HCW showed a strong IgG-specific responses to either NP or RBD. At t2, the rate increased to 4%, and after the second wave in January 2021, 14% had a strong response, which was assessed to be stable for up to ten months. The amount of HCW with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 38% higher than the number of infections found by PCR.

ConclusionWe found low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a hotspot setting after the first wave but a massive increase during the second wave distinctly surpassing the number of infected HCW identified by PCR. Our findings, therefore, offer support for the routine application of serological testing in management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

160,Structural Basis for Accommodation of Emerging B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 Variants by Two Potent SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, from the UK and South Africa, respectively show decreased neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and convalescent or vaccinee sera raised against the original wild-type virus, and are thus of clinical concern. However, the neutralization potency of two antibodies, 1-57 and 2-7, which target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike, was unaffected by these emerging strains. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of 1-57 and 2-7 in complex with spike, revealing each of these antibodies to utilize a distinct mechanism to bypass or accommodate RBD mutations. Notably, each antibody represented a response with recognition distinct from those of frequent antibody classes. Moreover, many epitope residues recognized by 1-57 and 2-7 were outside hotspots of evolutionary pressure for both ACE2 binding and neutralizing antibody escape. We suggest the therapeutic use of antibodies like 1-57 and 2-7, which target less prevalent epitopes, could ameliorate issues of monoclonal antibody escape.",Gabriele Cerutti; Micah Rapp; Yicheng Guo; Fabiana Bahna; Jude Bimela; Eswar R Reddem; Jian Yu; Pengfei Wang; Lihong Liu; Yaoxing Huang; David D Ho; Peter D Kwong; Zizhang Sheng; Lawrence Shapiro,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432168,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432168,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
161,Reduced binding and neutralization of infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies to the B.1.351 (South African) SARS-CoV-2 variant,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein is raising concerns about the efficacy of infection- or vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize these variants. We compared antibody binding and live virus neutralization of sera from naturally infected and spike mRNA vaccinated individuals against a circulating SARS-CoV-2 B.1 variant and the emerging B.1.351 variant. In acutely-infected (5-19 days post-symptom onset), convalescent COVID-19 individuals (through 8 months post-symptom onset) and mRNA-1273 vaccinated individuals (day 14 post-second dose), we observed an average 4.3-fold reduction in antibody titers to the B.1.351-derived receptor binding domain of the spike protein and an average 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant as compared to the B.1 variant (spike D614G). However, most acute and convalescent sera from infected and all vaccinated individuals neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, suggesting that protective immunity is retained against COVID-19.",Venkata Viswanadh Edara; Carson Norwood; Katharine Floyd; Lilin Lai; Meredith E Davis-Gardner; William H Hudson; Grace Mantus; Lindsay E Nyhoff; Max W Adelman; Rebecca Fineman; Shivan Patel; Rebecca Byram; Dumingu Nipuni Gomes; Garett Michael; Hayatu Abdullahi; Nour Beydoun; Bernadine Panganiban; Nina McNair; Kieffer Hellmeister; Jamila Pitts; Joy Winters; Jennifer Kleinhenz; Jacob Usher; Anne Piantadosi; Jesse J Waggoner; Ahmed Babiker; David S Stephens; Evan J Anderson; Srilatha Edupuganti; Nadine Rouphael; Rafi Ahmed; Jens Wrammert; Mehul S Suthar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.432046,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.432046,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
162,A novel glucocorticoid and androgen receptor modulator reduces viral entry and innate immune inflammatory responses in the Syrian Hamster model of SARS-CoV-2,"Since its initial discovery in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID19, has spread worldwide and despite significant research efforts, treatment options remain limited. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung is associated with marked infiltration of macrophages and activation of innate immune inflammatory responses triggered, in part, by heightened production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that recruits lymphocytes to the site of infection that amplify tissue injury. Antagonists of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors have shown promise in experimental models of COVID19 and in clinical studies, because cell surface proteins required for viral entry, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are transcriptionally regulated by these receptors. We therefore postulated that the glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, PT150, would reduce infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent inflammatory lung injury in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID19. Animals were infected intranasally with 2.5 x 104 TCID50/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/ 2020) and PT150 was administered by oral gavage at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day for a total of 7 days. Animals were then examined at days 3, 5 and 7 post-infection (DPI) for lung histopathology, viral load and production of proteins regulating the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results of these studies indicated that oral administration of PT150 decreased replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung, as well as expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein. Hypercellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration driven by macrophage responses were dramatically decreased in PT150-treated animals, as was tissue damage and expression of IL-6. Molecular modeling suggested that PT150 binds to the co-activator interface of the ligand binding domain of both AR and GR and thereby acts as an allosteric modulator and transcriptional repressor of these receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of AR and GR across multiple species permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a high degree of sequence identity maintained across species, including human, suggesting that the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy observed in Syrian hamsters would likely be predictive of positive outcomes in patients. PT150 is therefore a strong candidate for further clinical development for the treatment of COVID19 across variants of SARS-CoV-2.",Savannah M. Rocha; Anna C. Fagre; Amanda S. Latham; Katriana A.

However, ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can render monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Here we completely map all mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody, LY-CoV555, and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (E484K escapes LY-CoV555, K417N/T escape LY-CoV016). Additionally, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail.

164,Comparative Perturbation-Based Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding with Host Receptor and Neutralizing Antibodies : Structurally Adaptable Allosteric Communication Hotspots Define Spike Sites Targeted by Global Circulating Mutations,"In this study, we used an integrative computational approach focused on comparative perturbation-based modeling to examine molecular mechanisms and determine functional signatures underlying role of functional residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by novel mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations. Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor are REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail (REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484 and N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2 we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417 and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major inter-molecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising activity of the spike protein.",Gennady Verkhivker; Steve Agajanian; Deniz Yazar Oztas; Grace Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432165,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432165,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False

166,Diagnostic accuracy of RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to a composite reference standard in hospitalized patients,"BackgroundCOVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused the greatest public health emergency of our time. Accurate laboratory detection of the virus is critical in order to contain the spread. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the cornerstone of laboratory diagnosis, there have been conflicting reports on the diagnostic accuracy of this method.

MethodsA retrospective review was performed on all hospitalized patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (at St. Pauls Hospital in Vancouver, BC) from March 13 - April 12, 2020. Diagnostic accuracy of initial PCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs was determined against a composite reference standard which included a clinical assessment of the likelihood of COVID-19 by medical experts, initial and repeat PCR, and post-hoc serological testing.

ResultsA total of 323 patients were included in the study, 33 (10.2%) tested positive and 290 (89.8%) tested negative by initial PCR. Patients testing positive were more likely to exhibit features of cough (66.7% vs 39.3%), shortness of breath (63.6% vs 35.9%), fever (72.7% vs 27.6%), radiographic findings (83.3% vs 39.6%) and severe outcomes including ICU admission (24.2% vs 9.7%) and mortality (21.2% vs 6.2%) compared to patients testing negative. Serology was performed on 90 patients and correlation between serology and PCR was 98.9%. There were 90 patients included in the composite reference standard. Compared to the composite reference standard, initial PCR had sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI 74.0 to 99.9%), specificity of 100% (95% CI 94.9 to 100%), positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI 81.5 to 100%) and a negative predictive value of 98.6% (95% CI 92.5 to 100%).

167,Targeting the Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein through GSK-3 Inhibition,"The coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus infections express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral replication, transcription, and virion assembly. Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, despite limited overall sequence conservation, raising the possibility that SARS- CoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors including lithium. We conducted a retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID- 19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.34 - 0.76], p = 0.001). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation and impair replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type dependent manner.

Targeting GSK-3 may therefore provide a new approach to treat COVID-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks.",Xiaolei Liu; Anurag Verma; Holly Ramage; Gustavo Garcia; Rebecca L Myers; Anastasia Lucas; Jake J Michaelson; William Coryell; Arvind Kumar; Alexander Charney; Marcelo G.

A comprehensive attempt was made in this study to define a methodological approach for conducting WBE studies in the framework of identifying/selection of surveillance sites, standardizing sampling policy, designing sampling protocols to improve sensitivity, adopting safety protocol, and interpreting the data. The methodology was applied to a community and studied its epidemiological status with reference to occurrence, persistence, and variation of SARS-CoV-2 genome load in wastewater system to understand the prevalence of infection.

designA nationally representative cross-sectional survey was used. Univariate analysis was employed to compute vaccine hesitancy proportions and compare them across groups and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to compute the adjusted odds ratio.

settingBangladesh

participantsA total of 1134 participants from the general population, aged 18 years and above.

outcome measuresPrevalence and predictors of vaccine hesitancy.

results32.5% of participants showed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Hesitancy was high among respondents who were males, over age 60, unemployed, from low-income families, from central Bangladesh including Dhaka, living in rented houses, tobacco users, politically affiliated, participants who did not believe in the vaccines effectiveness for Bangladeshis and those who did not have any physical illnesses in the last year. In the multilevel logistic regression models, respondents who were transgender (AOR= 3.62), married (AOR=1.49), tobacco users (AOR=1.33), those who did not get any physical illnesses in the last year (AOR=1.49), those with political affiliations with opposition parties (AOR= 1.48), those who believed COVID-19 vaccines will not be effective for Bangladeshis (AOR= 3.20), and those who were slightly concerned (AOR = 2.87) or not concerned at all (AOR = 7.45) about themselves or a family member getting infected with COVID-19 in the next one year were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05).

conclusionsGiven the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, it is important to promote evidence-based communication, mass media campaigns, and policy initiatives across Bangladesh to reduce vaccine hesitancy among the Bangladeshi population.

Strengths and Limitations of the studyO_LIThis study is the first its kind to measure COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Bangladesh.

170,Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Child and Staff COVID-19 Cases in US Summer Camps,"BackgroundMost camps remained closed during Summer 2020, due to concerns regarding child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and limited information about the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) within child congregate settings.

MethodsWe surveyed US camps about on-site operations, camper and staff demographics, COVID-19 cases amongst campers and staff, and NPI usage as related to pre-camp quarantines, facial coverings, physical distancing, cleaning, and facility modifications. For all NPIs, save quarantines, responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale format.

ResultsWithin 486 on-site camps, a range of NPIs were instituted, most often related to reduced camper interactions, staff face coverings, cleaning, and hand hygiene. Camper facial coverings were less common, with campers always wearing masks at [~]34% of the camps. Approximately 15% of camps reported 1+ confirmed COVID-19 case in either campers or staff, with three camps reporting a COVID outbreak. In both single and multi-NPI analyses, the risk of COVID-19 cases was lowest when campers always wore facial coverings. While less effective, constant use of staff facial coverings and targeted physical distancing measures, but not pre-camp quarantine, also reduced COVID-19 risks.

ConclusionsWe found constant facial coverings, especially for campers, and targeted physical distancing measures to reduce risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within summer camps. Our findings provide valuable guidance for future operations of camp and other child congregate settings with regard to efficient and effective NPI usage to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Whats Known on This SubjectApproximately 82% of US overnight camps did not open during Summer 2020 due to concerns regarding childrens ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2. Camps that did operate during this time instituted varied non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with little information available on the effectiveness of these NPIs within child congregate settings. Large population-based studies are needed to improve our understanding of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst children and their caregivers and to determine whether and to what degree child congregate programs can safely open during the pandemic.

What This Study AddsOur study, the largest survey of COVID-19 cases in child congregate settings at the national level, provides new information on the relative effectiveness of NPIs on mitigating COVID cases among children and staff within camp settings. We showed COVID-19 case rates in campers and staff to be low relative to corresponding case rates in the US and found constant camper facial coverings to be the most effective risk reduction method for SARS-CoV-2 transmission within camps. While less effective, constant use of staff facial coverings and targeted physical distancing measures, but not pre-camp quarantines, were also shown to reduce COVID-19 risks. Our findings has important implications for child congregate settings, helping to guide their successful opening and operation.",Helen H Suh; Laura Blaisdell; Julianne Meehan; Laurie Browne,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21250271,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21250271,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True

Here, we have developed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with non-toxic zinc oxide nanomaterial for potential use as membrane filter in the one way valve for the ease of breathing without the threat of COVID-19 spreading. A detailed computational study revealed that zinc oxide nanoflowers (ZnO NF) with almost two-dimensional petals trap SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, responsible to attach to ACE-2 receptors in human lung epithelial cells. The study also confirm significant denaturation of the spike proteins on the ZnO surface, revealing removal of virus upon efficient trapping. Following the computational study, we have synthesized ZnO NF on cotton matrix using hydrothermal assisted strategy. Electron microscopic, steady-state and picosecond resolved spectroscopic studies confirm attachment of ZnO NF to the cotton (i.e., cellulose) matrix at atomic level to develop the nanoceutical fabric. A detailed antimicrobial assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria (model SARS-CoV-2 mimic) reveals excellent anti-microbial efficiency of the developed nanoceutical fabric. To our understanding the novel nanoceutical fabric used in one-way valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure breathing comfort along with source control of COVID-19 infection.

Here we delivered the S1 subunit of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the skin of BALB/c mice via laser-generated micropores with or without CpG-ODN1826 or the B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin of E.coli (LT-B). EPI induced serum IgG titers of 1:3200 that could be boosted 5 to 10-fold by co-administration of LT-B and CpG, respectively.

174,An Autoantigen Profile of Human A549 Lung Cells Reveals Viral and Host Etiologic Molecular Attributes of Autoimmunity in COVID-19,"We aim to establish a comprehensive COVID-19 autoantigen atlas in order to understand autoimmune diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination. This study provides a large list of autoantigens as well as new targets for future investigation, e.g., UBA1, UCHL1, USP7, CDK11A, PRKDC, PLD3, PSAT1, RAB1A, SLC2A1, platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins.

175,The interspecific fungal hybrid Verticillium longisporum displays sub-genome-specific gene expression,"Hybridization is an important evolutionary mechanism that can enable organisms to adapt to environmental challenges. It has previously been shown that the fungal allodiploid species Verticillium longisporum, causal agent of Verticillium stem striping in rape seed, has originated from at least three independent hybridization events between two haploid Verticillium species. To reveal the impact of genome duplication as a consequence of the hybridization, we studied the genome and transcriptome dynamics upon two independent V. longisporum hybridization events, represented by the hybrid lineages ""A1/D1"" and ""A1/D3"". We show that the V. longisporum genomes are characterized by extensive chromosomal rearrangements, including between parental chromosomal sets. V. longisporum hybrids display signs of evolutionary dynamics that are typically associated with the aftermath of allodiploidization, such as haploidization and a more relaxed gene evolution. Expression patterns of the two sub-genomes within the two hybrid lineages are more similar than those of the shared A1 parent between the two lineages, showing that expression patterns of the parental genomes homogenized within a lineage. However, as genes that display differential parental expression in planta do not typically display the same pattern in vitro, we conclude that sub-genome-specific responses occur in both lineages. Overall, our study uncovers the genomic and transcriptomic plasticity during evolution of the filamentous fungal hybrid V. longisporum and illustrate its adaptive potential.

ImportanceVerticillium is a genus of plant-associated fungi that include a handful of plant pathogens that collectively affect a wide range of hosts. On several occasions, haploid Verticillium species hybridized into the stable allodiploid species Verticillium longisporum, which is, in contrast to haploid Verticillium species, a Brassicaceae specialist. Here, we studied the evolutionary genome and transcriptome dynamics of V. longisporum and the impact of the hybridization. V. longisporum genomes display a mosaic structure due do genomic rearrangements between the parental chromosome sets. Similar to other allopolyploid hybrids, V. longisporum displays an ongoing loss of heterozygosity and a more relaxed gene evolution. Also, differential parental gene expression is observed, with an enrichment for genes that encode secreted proteins. Intriguingly, the majority of these genes displays sub-genome-specific responses under differential growth conditions. In conclusion, hybridization has incited the genomic and transcriptomic plasticity that enables adaptation to environmental changes in a parental allele-specific fashion.",Edurne Rujas; Iga Kucharska; Yong Zi Tan; Samir Benlekbir; Hong Cui; Tiantian Zhao; Gregory A Wasney; Patrick Budylowski; Furkan Guvenc; Jocelyn C Newton; Taylor Sicard; Anthony Semesi; Krithika Muthuraman; Amy Nouanesengsy; Katherine Prieto; Stephanie A Bueler; Sawsan Youssef; Sindy Liao-Chan; Jacob Glanville; Natasha Christie-Holmes; Samira Mubareka; Scott D Gray-Owen; John L Rubinstein; Bebhinn Treanor; Jean-Philippe Julien,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/341636,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/341636,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
176,"High-Throughput, Single-Copy Sequencing Reveals SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variants Coincident with Mounting Humoral Immunity during Acute COVID-19","Tracking evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within infected individuals will help elucidate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and inform use of antiviral interventions. In this study, we developed an approach for sequencing the region encoding the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface proteins from large numbers of individual virus RNA genomes per sample. We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH2-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing 3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a capacity for rapid genetic adaptation that becomes detectable in vivo with the onset of humoral immunity, with the potential to contribute to delayed virologic clearance in the acute setting.

Author SummaryMutant sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arising during any individual case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could theoretically enable the virus to evade immune responses or antiviral therapies that target the predominant infecting virus sequence. However, commonly used sequencing technologies are not optimally designed to detect variant virus sequences within each sample. To address this issue, we developed novel technology for sequencing large numbers of individual SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA molecules across the region encoding the virus surface proteins. This technology revealed extensive genetic diversity in cultured viruses from a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but lower diversity in samples from 7 individuals with COVID-19. Importantly, concurrent analysis of paired serum samples in selected individuals revealed relatively low levels of antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the time of initial sequencing. With increased serum binding to spike protein, we detected multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing independent mutations in a single epitope, as well as a transient increase in virus burden. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replication creates sufficient virus genetic diversity to allow immune-mediated selection of variants within the time frame of acute COVID-19. Large-scale studies of SARS-CoV-2 variation and specific immune responses will help define the contributions of intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 evolution to COVID-19 clinical outcomes and antiviral drug susceptibility.",Sung Hee Ko; Elham Bayat Mokhtari; Prakriti Mudvari; Sydney Stein; Christopher D Stringham; Danielle Wagner; Sabrina Ramelli; Marcos J Ramirez-Benitez; Jeffrey R Strich; Richard T Davey Jr.; Tongqing Zhou; John Misasi; Peter D Kwong; Daniel S Chertow; Nancy J Sullivan; Eli A Boritz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432184,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432184,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
177,Acquisition of the L452R mutation in the ACE2-binding interface of Spike protein triggers recent massive expansion of SARS-Cov-2 variants,"The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the Spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies. Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently. The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 - February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.",Veronika Tchesnokova; Hemantha Kulakesara; Lydia Larson; Victoria Bowers; Elena Rechkina; Dagmara Kisiela; Yulia Sledneva; Debarati Choudhury; Iryna Maslova; Kai Deng; Kirthi Kutumbaka; Hao Geng; Curtis Fowler; James D.

178,Reanalysis of deep-sequencing data from Austria points towards a small SARS-COV-2 transmission bottleneck on the order of one to three virions,"An early analysis of SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequencing data that combined epidemiological and genetic data to characterize the transmission dynamics of the virus in and beyond Austria concluded that the size of the viruss transmission bottleneck was large - on the order of 1000 virions. We performed new computational analyses using these deep-sequenced samples from Austria. Our analyses included characterization of transmission bottleneck sizes across a range of variant calling thresholds and examination of patterns of shared low-frequency variants between transmission pairs in cases where de novo genetic variation was present in the recipient. From these analyses, among others, we found that SARS-CoV-2 transmission bottlenecks are instead likely to be very tight, on the order of 1-3 virions. These findings have important consequences for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 evolves between hosts and the processes shaping genetic variation observed at the population level.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432096,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432096,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
179,Experimental evidence for enhanced receptor binding by rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Rapidly spreading new variants of SARS-CoV-2 carry multiple mutations in the viral spike protein which attaches to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells. Among these mutations are amino acid changes N501Y (lineage B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK), and the combination N501Y, E484K, K417N (B.1.351, first identified in South Africa), all located at the interface on the receptor binding domain (RBD). We experimentally establish that RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 9-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than wild type RBD. The E484K mutation does not significantly influence the affinity for the receptor, while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result, RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds 3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 3-fold weaker than N501Y. The recently emerging double mutant E484K/N501Y binds as tight as N501Y. The independent evolution of lineages containing mutations with different effects on receptor binding affinity, viral transmission and immune evasion underscores the importance of global viral genome surveillance and functional characterization.",Charlie Laffeber; Kelly de Koning; Roland Kanaar; Joyce Lebbink,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432357,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432357,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
180,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and its individual differences with ACE2-expressing human iPS cells,"Genetic differences are a primary reason for differences in the susceptibility and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells maintain the genetic information of the donor, they can be used to model individual differences in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in vitro. Notably, undifferentiated human iPS cells themselves cannot be infected bySARS-CoV-2. Using adenovirus vectors, here we found that human iPS cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (ACE2-iPS cells) can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In infected ACE2-iPS cells, the expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, the budding of viral particles, the production of progeny virus, double membrane spherules, and double-membrane vesicles were confirmed. We also evaluated COVID-19 therapeutic drugs in ACE2-iPS cells and confirmed the strong antiviral effects of Remdesivir, EIDD-2801, and interferon-beta. In addition, we performed SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on ACE2-iPS/ES cells from 8 individuals. Male iPS/ES cells were more capable of producing the virus as compared with female iPS/ES cells. These findings suggest that ACE2-iPS cells can not only reproduce individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, but they are also a useful resource to clarify the causes of individual differences in COVID-19 due to genetic differences.

181,Targeting CoV-2 Spike RBD and ACE-2 Interaction with Flavonoids of Anatolian Propolis by in silico and in vitro Studies in terms of possible COVID-19 therapeutics,"Propolis is a multi-functional bee product with a rich in polyphenols. In this study, the inhibition effect of Anatolian propolis against SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) was investigated as in vitro and in silico. Raw and commercial of propolis samples were used in the study and it was found that both of were rich in caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, t-cinnamic acid, hesperetin, chrysin, pinocembrin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) by HPLC-UV analysis. The ethanolic propolis extracts (EPE) were used in the screening ELISA test against the spike S1 protein (SARS Cov-2): ACE-2 inhibition KIT for in vitro study. Binding energy constants of these polyphenols to the CoV-2 Spike S1 RBD and ACE-2 proteinwere calculated separately as molecular docking study using AutoDock 4.2 molecular docking software. In addition, pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of these eight polyphenols were calculated according to the SwissADME tool. Binding energy constant of pinocembrin was found the highest for both receptors, followed by chrysin, CAPE and hesperetin. In silico ADME behavior of the eight polyphenol was found potential ability to work effectively as novel drugs.

182,A cannabinoid receptor agonist shows anti-inflammatory and survival properties in human SARS-CoV-2-infected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can infect several organs and lead to loss of vital organ function, especially impacting respiratory capacity. Among the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 is myocardial injury, caused both directly and indirectly by SARS-CoV-2, and which is associated with a high risk of mortality. One of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 is the ""cytokine storm"", at which point the immune system malfunctions, leading to possible organ failure and death. Cannabinoids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties by negatively modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Herein, we investigated the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) on SARS-CoV-2-infected human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Although WIN did not modulate angiotensin-converting enzyme II, nor reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in hiPSC-CMs at the conditions tested, it had anti-inflammatory and protective effects by reducing the levels of interleukins 6, 8,18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in these cells without causing hypertrophic cardiac damage. These findings suggest that cannabinoids should be further investigated as an alternative therapeutic tool for the treatment of COVID-19.

183,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cardiomyocytes by targeting the Sigma-1 receptor disrupts cytoskeleton architecture and contractility,"Heart dysfunction, represented by conditions such as myocarditis and arrhythmia, has been reported in COVID-19 patients. Therapeutic strategies focused on the cardiovascular system, however, remain scarce. The Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has been recently proposed as a therapeutic target because its inhibition reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication. To investigate the role of S1R in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, we used human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CM) as an experimental model. Here we show that the S1R antagonist NE-100 decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in hiPSC-CMs. Also, NE-100 reduces cytokine release and cell death associated with infection. Because S1R is involved in cardiac physiology, we investigated the effects of NE-100 in cardiomyocyte morphology and function. We show that NE-100 compromises cytoskeleton integrity and reduces beating frequency, causing contractile impairment. These results show that targeting S1R to challenge SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful therapeutic strategy but its detrimental effects in vivo on cardiac function should not be ignored.",José Alexandre Salerno; Thayana Torquato; Jairo R Temerozo; Livia Goto-Silva; Mayara A.

185,"Predicting mortality, duration of treatment, pulmonary embolism and required ceiling of ventilatory support for COVID-19 inpatients: A Machine-Learning Approach","IntroductionWithin the UK, COVID-19 has contributed towards over 103,000 deaths. Multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified including various demographics, co-morbidities, biochemical parameters, and physical assessment findings. However, using this vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging.

Aimsto develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, to aid risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making.

MethodsAnonymized data regarding 44 independent predictor variables of 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case-controlled analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, level of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy required, and duration of inpatient treatment. Secondary pulmonary embolism was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were created using Bayesian Networks, and cross-validated.

ResultsOur multivariable models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of inpatient mortality (F1 score 83.7%, PPV 82%, NPV 67.9%); level of ventilatory support required (F1 score varies from 55.8% ""High-flow Oxygen level"" to 71.5% ""ITU-Admission level""); duration of inpatient treatment (varies from 46.7% for ""[&ge;] 2 days but < 3 days"" to 69.8% ""[&le;] 1 day""); and risk of pulmonary embolism sequelae (F1 score 85.8%, PPV of 83.7%, and NPV of 80.9%).

ConclusionOverall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4 outcomes, that utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as clinical decision-making tools.

186,Evaluation of rapid antibody test and chest computed tomography results of COVID-19 patients: A retrospective study,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread around the world. Therefore, rapid, simpler, and more accurate diagnostic tests are urgently needed to diagnose the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM/ IgG rapid antibody test results in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and their chest computed tomography (CT) data.

MethodsA total of 320 patients admitted to our hospital for different durations due to COVID-19 were included in the study. Serum samples were obtained within 0 to 7 days from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR and chest CT scan. According to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, the patients included in the study were divided into two groups: PCR positive group (n=46), and PCR negative group (n=274).

ResultsOf the 320 COVID-19 serum samples, IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG were detected in 9.4%, 3.1%, and 17.8% within one week respectively. IgG/IgM antibodies were not detected in 69.7% of the patients. In the study, it was determined that 249 (77.8%) of 320 patients had positive chest CT scans. Four (5.6%) of 100 patients with negative chest CT scan had IgM positive and 2 (2.8%) had both IgM/ IgG positive. IgM was detected in 23 (9.2%), IgG in 1 (0.4%) and IgM/IgG in 35 (14%) of chest CT scan positive patients. The rate of CT findings in patients with antibody positivity (n=97) was found to be significantly higher than those with antibody negativity.

ConclusionsThe results of the present study show the accurate and equivalent performance of serological antibody assays and chest CT in detecting SARS-CoV-2 0 to 7 days from the onset of COVID19 symptoms. When the RT-PCR is not available, we believe that the combination of immunochromatographic test and chest CT scan can increase diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.",Ali Ozturk; Taylan Bozok; Tugce Simsek Bozok,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251772,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251772,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
187,Impaired local intrinsic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can lead to severe lower respiratory illness including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can result in profound morbidity and mortality. However, many infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have isolated upper respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the upper airways represent the initial site of viral infection, and that some individuals are able to largely constrain viral pathology to the nasal and oropharyngeal tissues. Which cell types in the human nasopharynx are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how infection influences the cellular organization of the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. Here, we present nasopharyngeal samples from a cohort of 35 individuals with COVID-19, representing a wide spectrum of disease states from ambulatory to critically ill, as well as 23 healthy and intubated patients without COVID-19. Using standard nasopharyngeal swabs, we collected viable cells and performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), simultaneously profiling both host and viral RNA. We find that following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the upper respiratory epithelium undergoes massive reorganization: secretory cells diversify and expand, and mature epithelial cells are preferentially lost. Further, we observe evidence for deuterosomal cell and immature ciliated cell expansion, potentially representing active repopulation of lost ciliated cells through coupled secretory cell differentiation. Epithelial cells from participants with mild/moderate COVID-19 show extensive induction of genes associated with anti-viral and type I interferon responses. In contrast, cells from participants with severe lower respiratory symptoms appear globally muted in their anti-viral capacity, despite substantially higher local inflammatory myeloid populations and equivalent nasal viral loads. This suggests an essential role for intrinsic, local epithelial immunity in curbing and constraining viral-induced pathology. Using a custom computational pipeline, we characterized cell-associated SARS-CoV-2 RNA and identified rare cells with RNA intermediates strongly suggestive of active replication. Both within and across individuals, we find remarkable diversity and heterogeneity among SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host cells, including developing/immature and interferon-responsive ciliated cells, KRT13+ ""hillock""-like cells, and unique subsets of secretory, goblet, and squamous cells. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, as compared to uninfected bystanders, are enriched for genes involved in susceptibility (e.g., CTSL, TMPRSS2) or response (e.g., MX1, IFITM3, EIF2AK2) to infection.

We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA psychotropic medication use among patients with mental disorder hospitalized for severe COVID-19, in an observational multicenter retrospective study conducted at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 545 adult patients with mental disorder hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 164 (30.1%) received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at study baseline, which was defined as the date of hospital admission for COVID-19. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at baseline and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and other medical comorbidity, and psychotropic and other medications. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). There was a significant association between FIASMA psychotropic medication use at baseline and reduced risk of intubation or death both in the crude analysis (HR=0.42; 95%CI=0.31-0.57; p<0.01) and in the primary IPW analysis (HR=0.50; 95%CI=0.37-0.67; p<0.01). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Exploratory analyses suggested that this association was not specific to one FIASMA psychotropic class or medication. These results suggest the usefulness of the ASM/ceramide system framework in COVID-19.

189,Statewide Impact of COVID-19 on Social Determinants of Health - A First Look: Findings from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin,"There is an urgent need to track the early and ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health from local to global scales. At the same time, there is an overall lack of U.S. state-specific surveillance data tracking social determinants of health (SDOH) and associations with population well-being, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic in populations. Statewide data can offer important insights into how SDOH shape the long-term effects of COVID-19 in the population since implementation of many policies and programs varied widely early on in the pandemic. In May of 2020, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) program launched a statewide online/phone survey of early and ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on health and well-being across diverse communities and families. The goal of this study is to provide descriptive data including perceived COVID-19 risks, access to and results of COVID-19 antigen testing, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic on health and mental health in populations. Key findings include higher rates of testing and perceived past infection from COVID-19 among non-white respondents. Higher economic shifts and job changes in female vs male respondents. Families with children reported overall higher levels of stress, and stress from the pandemic. There were urban and rural differences in changes to access to care. Rural regions, which had a lower prevalence of infections early in the pandemic as compared to urban areas, also reported fewer delays or missed appointments due to COVID-19. Key findings show that SDOH are shaping impacts of health and well-being early on in the pandemic and future longitudinal follow-up will be important to shape policies and programs well into the future.",Kristen MC Malecki; Amy A Schultz; Maria Nikodemova; Matthew C Walsh; Andrew J.

190,KLF2 is a therapeutic target for COVID-19 induced endothelial dysfunction,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is regarded as an endothelial disease (endothelialitis) with its mechanism being incompletely understood. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the endothelium represents the Achilles heel in COVID-19 patients and that endothelial dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus, pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 and its cardiovascular complications. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were treated with serum from control subjects or COVID-19 patients. Downstream monocyte adhesion and associated gene/protein expression was evaluated in endothelial cells exposed to COVID-19 patient serum in the presence of KLF2 activator (Atorvastatin) or KLF2 overexpression by an adenoviral vector. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2 was significantly reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and VCAM1. IL-1{beta} and TNF-, two cytokines observed in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Next-generation RNA-sequencing data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis and reduced angiogenesis). Treatment of HPMECs with atorvastatin or KLF2 adenovirus ameliorate COVID-19 serum-induced increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion by increasing KLF2 expression. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that genetic and pharmacological activation of KLF2 represses COVID-19 associated endothelial dysfunction, heralding a potentially new direction to treat endothelialitis accompanying COVID-19.

191,Persisting adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Lower Austria,"The prevalence and persistence of adaptive immunity responses following a SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into potential population immunity. Adaptive immune responses comprise of antibody-based responses as well as T cell responses mainly addressing viruses and virus-infected human cells, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of both types of adaptive immunity is essential to follow population-based SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. In this study, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell activities in patients who recovered from a COVID-19 infection in spring and autumn 2020. Here we observed a robust and stable SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune response in both groups with persisting IgA and IgG levels as well as stable T cell activity. Moreover, there was a positive correlation of a lasting immune response with the severity of disease. Our data give evidence for a persisting adaptive immune memory, which suggest a continuing immunity for more than six months post infection.",Dennis Ladage; Oliver Harzer; Peter Engel; Hannes Winkler; Ralf Braun,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251551,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
192,Profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response: Relationship with disease severity and impact of HIV-1 and active Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-infection,"T cells are involved in control of COVID-19, but limited knowledge is available on the relationship between antigen-specific T cell response and disease severity. Here, we assessed the magnitude, function and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) co-infected) and 38 non-COVID-19 patients, using flow cytometry. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, associates with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB co-infection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1 mediated CD4 T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression. There results corroborate the important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis and support the concept of altered T cell functions in patients with severe disease.",Catherine Riou; Elsa du Bruyn; Cari Stek; Remy Daroowala; Rene T Goliath; Fatima Abrahams; Qonita Said-Hartley; Brian W Allowed; Marvin Hsiao; Katalin A Wilkinson; Cecilia S Lindestam Arlehamn; Alessandro Sette; Sean Wasserman; Robert J Wilkinson; - the HIATUS consortium,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251838,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251838,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
193,Applicability of Neighborhood and Building Scale Wastewater-Based Genomic Epidemiology to Track the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and other Pathogens.,"The benefits of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for tracking the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, have become apparent since the start of the pandemic. However, most sampling occurs at the wastewater treatment plant influent and therefore can only monitor SARS-CoV-2 concentration and spread within the entire catchment, which can encompass multiple municipalities. Furthermore, most WBE only quantifies the virus, and therefore miss crucial information that can be gained by sequencing SARS-CoV-2. Here we demonstrate feasibility of sampling at the neighborhood or building complex level using a mix of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted sequencing to provide a more refined understanding of the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains. When coupled with the higher-level treatment plant samples, this creates an opportunity for health officials to monitor the spread of the virus at different spatial and temporal scales to inform policy decisions.

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the neighborhood, hospital, and nursing home level with the ability to detect one COVID-19 positive out of 60 nursing home residents. The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital. Sequencing of the samples over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations fluctuate in the viral population, and wastewater-based sequencing could be an efficient approach to monitor for vaccine or convalescent plasma escape mutants, as well as mutations that could reduce the efficacy of diagnostics. Furthermore, while SARS-CoV-2 was detected by untargeted RNA sequencing, qPCR and targeted whole genome amplicon sequencing were more reliable methods for tracking the pandemic. From our sequencing data, clades and shifts in mutation profiles within the community were traceable and could be used to determine if vaccine or diagnostics need to be adapted to ensure continued efficacy.

194,Estimates of the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine based on two data sets,"BackgroundTo simulate how the number of COVID-19 cases increases versus time, various data sets for the number of new cases and different mathematical models can be used. Since there are some differences in statistical data, the results of simulations can be different. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches are necessary. In particular, previous simulations of the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine were based on smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the generalized SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic and to make adequate predictions of the their duration and final sizes. In particular, eight waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated.

ObjectiveWe will compare the results simulation of a new epidemic wave in Ukraine based on national statistics and data reported by Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

MethodsIn this study we use the smoothing method for the dependences of the number of cases on time, the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations, and statistical approach developed before.

ResultsNinth epidemic wave in Ukraine was simulated. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated and compared with the use of two data sets. Both predictions are not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June-July 2021.

ConclusionsNew waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical models. The results of calculations depend on the data sets for the number of confirmed cases. The expected long duration of the pandemic forces us to be careful and in solidarity. The government and all Ukrainians must strictly adhere to quarantine measures in order to avoid fatal consequences. Probably the presented results could be useful in order to estimate the efficiency of future vaccinations.",Igor Nesteruk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252000,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252000,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True

196,Early Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Emergence in the DoD via Retrospective Analysis of 2019-2020 Upper Respiratory Illness Samples,"The first case of non-travel related SARS-COV-2 was detected late February 2020 in California, however the delay of diagnostic testing and initial stringent testing criteria made it difficult to identify those who could have acquired it through community spread. There was speculation by many that the virus may have been circulating at least a month earlier [1], and environmental sampling has suggested that versions of this virus were found many months before the first human samples were identified [2]. Here we performed a retrospective study from residual samples collected from a global DoD Respiratory Surveillance Program to establish a tentative timeline by which this virus was circulating in our DoD population. We performed RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2 and compared to the dates of these cases to the first cases identified in respective states and counties using the Johns Hopkins COVID tracker website. Twenty-four positive samples were identified out of approximately 7,000 tested. Although we found some early cases in certain regions, we did not see circulation before late February in samples collected both in the US and outside the USA.

SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this topic?C_ST_ABSWe know that the first reported case of SARS-COV-2 was mid-January; however, there has been conjecture that the virus was found in the community before this date.

What is added by this report?Here we took samples collection from a global respiratory surveillance program and evaluated for the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA. The first case we found in the surveillance program was approximately 30-60 days before the first case was identified on military installations via diagnostic testing, however was not earlier than the mid-January reported case in California.

198,Reported COVID-19 Incidence in Wisconsin High School Athletes During Fall 2020,"IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to describe the reported incidence of COVID-19 in Wisconsin high school athletes in September 2020, and to investigate the relationship of COVID-19 incidence with sport and face mask use.

MethodsSurveys were sent to athletic directors of all Wisconsin high schools regarding sports during September 2020. The association between reported case rates in athletes in each county and the county general population were evaluated with a weighted linear model. Multivariable negative binomial regression models evaluated the associations between COVID-19 incidence and sport type and face mask use by players, adjusting for the county COVID-19 incidence for each school.

Results207 schools that had reinitiated sport reported 270 COVID-19 cases among 30,074 players, for case and incidence rates of 809 cases per 100,000 players and 32.6 cases per 100,000 player-days, respectively. The case rates for athletes in each county were positively correlated with the case rates for the countys general population ({beta} =1.14{+/-}0.20, r=0.60, p<0.001). One hundred fifteen (55%) of cases were attributed to household contact, 85 (41%) to contact outside sport or school, 5 (2.4%) to school contact, and 1 (0.5%) to sport contact. No difference was identified between team and individual sports (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.03 [95% CI=0.49-2.2], p=0.93) or between non-contact and contact sports (IRR=0.53 [0.23-1.3], p=0.14), although the difference between outdoor and indoor sports approached statistical significance (IRR=0.52 [0.26-1.1], p=0.07). 84% of schools required face masks while playing. For those sports with >50 participating schools, there were no significant associations between COVID-19 incidence and face mask use in cross country (IRR=0.71 [0.2-2.2], p=0.52), football (IRR=1.6 [0.6-5.1], p=0.404), boys soccer (IRR=2.3 [0.5-17], p=0.31), or girls volleyball (IRR=1.4 [0.3-6.6], p=0.64).

ConclusionsIncidence of reported COVID-19 among athletes was related to background county incidence and most cases were attributed to household and community contact. Although not statistically significant, reported COVID-19 incidence may be lower in outdoor sports. Face mask use did not have a significant benefit, which may be due to relatively low rates of COVID-19 and the small number of schools that did not report using face masks.",Phillip Sasser; Timothy McGuine; Kristin Haraldsdottir; Kevin Biese; Leslie Goodavish; Bethany Stevens; Andrew Watson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251986,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251986,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
199,Mortality after surgery with SARS-CoV-2 infection in England: A population-wide epidemiological study,"ObjectivesTo confirm the incidence of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality after surgery.

Design and settingAnalysis of routine electronic health record data from National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England.

MethodsWe extracted data from Hospital Episode Statistics in England describing adult patients undergoing surgery between 1st January 2020 and 31st October 2020. The exposure was SARS-CoV-2 infection defined by ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome measure was 90-day in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index, index of multiple deprivation, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and admission acuity. Results are presented as n (%) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.

ResultsWe identified 1,972,153 patients undergoing surgery of whom 11,940 (0.6%) had SARS-CoV-2. In total, 19,100 (1.0%) patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a much greater risk of death (SARS-CoV-2: 2,618/11,940 [21.9%] vs No SARS-CoV-2: 16,482/1,960,213 [0.8%]; OR: 5.8 [5.5 - 6.1]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing elective surgery 1,030/1,374,985 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 of whom 83/1,030 (8.1%) died, compared with 1,092/1,373,955 (0.1%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 29.0 [22.5 -37.3]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing emergency surgery 9,742/437,891 (2.2%) patients had SARS-CoV-2, of whom 2,466/9,742 (25.3%) died compared with 14,817/428,149 (3.5%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 5.7 [5.4 - 6.0]; p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS surgical pathways suggests current infection prevention and control policies are highly effective. However, the high mortality amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggests these precautions cannot be safely relaxed.

200,Preservation of neutralizing antibody function in COVID-19 convalescent plasma treated using a riboflavin and ultraviolet light-based pathogen reduction technology,"Background and ObjectiveConvalescent plasma (CP) has been embraced as a safe therapeutic option for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while other treatments are developed. However, transfusion-transmitted disease is a risk, particularly in regions with high endemic prevalence of transfusion-transmissible diseases. Pathogen reduction can mitigate this risk; thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R+UV) pathogen reduction technology on the functional properties of CCP.

Materials and MethodsCCP units (n = 6) from recovered COVID-19 research donors were treated with R+UV. Pre- and post-treatment samples were tested for coagulation factor and immunoglobulin retention. Antibody binding to spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), S1, and S2 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by ELISA.

Neutralizing antibody (nAb) function was assessed by pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).

ResultsMean retention of coagulation factors was [&ge;] 70% while retention of immunoglobulins was 100%. Starting nAb titers were low, but PRNT50 titers did not differ between pre- and post-treatment samples. No statistically significant differences were detected in levels of IgG (P [&ge;] 0.3665) and IgM (P [&ge;] 0.1208) antibodies to RBD, S1, and S2 proteins before and after treatment.

201,"Rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during the 2020 pandemic year in the population of the city of Tirana, Albania","IntroductionWhile the identification of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been used to measure the hidden circulation of the COVID-19 in communities, there are few publications on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during both waves of 2020. This study provides original data about the change in proportion of individuals showing immune response to COVID-19 between beginning of July and end of December 2020.

MethodsThe study was conducted in two rounds, 27 June -3 July, and 21-28 December 2020, using two independently selected samples of individuals 20-70 years old. Study participants were randomly selected from lists of the inhabitants of the catchment communities of four primary health care centers in Tirana City. Serological testing was performed by an ELISA method which determines IgG class antibodies anti S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The validity of the method was tested in a sample of blood donors sera of 2018.

ResultsThe proportion of individuals classified as seropositive during the first round, in early July was 7.5% (95% CI: 4.3% -10.7%). The proportion rose sharply in the second round, by late December 2020, reaching 48.2% (95% CI: 44.8% -51.7%). The same increasing pattern was observed in all studied categories. No statistical significance was found between men and women and between age categories. The prevalence of seropositive individuals was always significantly higher among those who reported symptoms and those who had done the molecular test.

ConclusionThe ratio of total infected cases over confirmed cases was estimated to be higher than 10 to 1 in Albania. The rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence observed in Tirana City may have been facilitated by a number of factors, including the very low infection exposure during the period March -May 2020, and the consecutive high susceptibility in population. Despite the observed high seroprevalence, one month after the study, COVID-19 incidence continued to increase in Tirana.",Genc Sulcebe; Alban Ylli; Fabian Cenko; Margarita Kurti-Prifti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251776,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251776,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
202,Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test (ALERT) for detecting SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted bottlenecks in large-scale, frequent testing of populations for infections. PCR-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on expensive centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests, that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus, are rapid and inexpensive but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, we have created an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute Do-It-Yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/{micro}l) and specificity (>97% True Negative Rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP).

Our workflow, ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test), incorporates the following features: 1) Increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from reaction, 2) Improved specificity by using sequence-specific QUASR reporters, 3) Increased sensitivity through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal, 4) Quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target, and 5) Co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as Influenza B, by duplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets.

The flexible nature of the ALERT workflow allows easy, at-home and point-of-care testing for individuals and higher-throughput processing for centralized labs and hospitals. With minimal effort, SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets can be swapped out for other targets to repurpose ALERT to detect other viruses, microorganisms or nucleic acid-based markers.",Ali Bektaş; Mike F.

203,A Multivariate Forecasting Model for the COVID-19 Hospital Census Based on Local Infection Incidence,"COVID-19 has been one of the most serious global health crises in world history. During the pandemic, healthcare systems require accurate forecasts for key resources to guide preparation for patient surges. Fore-casting the COVID-19 hospital census is among the most important planning decisions to ensure adequate staffing, number of beds, intensive care units, and vital equipment. In the literature, only a few papers have approached this problem from a multivariate time-series approach incorporating leading indicators for the hospital census. In this paper, we propose to use a leading indicator, the local COVID-19 infection incidence, together with the COVID-19 hospital census in a multivariate framework using a Vector Error Correction model (VECM) and aim to forecast the COVID-19 hospital census for the next 7 days. The model is also applied to produce scenario-based 60-day forecasts based on different trajectories of the pandemic. With several hypothesis tests and model diagnostics, we confirm that the two time-series have a cointegration relationship, which serves as an important predictor. Other diagnostics demonstrate the goodness-of-fit of the model. Using time-series cross-validation, we can estimate the out-of-sample Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The model has a median MAPE of 5.9%, which is lower than the 6.6% median MAPE from a univariate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. In the application of scenario-based long-term forecasting, future census exhibits concave trajectories with peaks lagging 2-3 weeks later than the peak infection incidence. Our findings show that the local COVID-19 infection incidence can be successfully in-corporated into a VECM with the COVID-19 hospital census to improve upon existing forecast models, and to deliver accurate short-term forecasts and realistic scenario-based long-term trajectories to help healthcare systems leaders in their decision making.

Author summaryDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems need to have adequate resources to accommodate demand from COVID-19 cases. One of the most important metrics for planning is the COVID-19 hospital census. Only a few papers make use of leading indicators within multivariate time-series models for this problem. We incorporated a leading indicator, the local COVID-19 infection incidence, together with the COVID-19 hospital census in a multivariate framework called the Vector Error Correction model to make 7-day-ahead forecasts. This model is also applied to produce 60-day scenario forecasts based on different trajectories of the pandemic. We find that the two time-series have a stable long-run relationship. The model has a good fit to the data and good forecast performance in comparison with a more traditional model using the census data alone. When applied to different 60-day scenarios of the pandemic, the census forecasts show concave trajectories that peak 2-3 weeks later than the infection incidence. Our paper presents this new model for accurate short-term forecasts and realistic scenario-based long-term forecasts of the COVID-19 hospital census to help healthcare systems in their decision making. Our findings suggest using the local COVID-19 infection incidence data can improve and extend more traditional forecasting models.",Hieu Minh Nguyen; Philip Turk; Andrew McWilliams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251243,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251243,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
204,Association between benzodiazepine receptor agonist use and increased mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19: results from an observational study,"ObjectiveTo examine the association between benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted an observational multicenter retrospective cohort study at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. The sample involved 14,381 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19. 686 (4.8%) inpatients received a BZRA within at the time of hospital admission at a mean daily diazepam-equivalent dose of 19.7 mg (SD=25.4). The study baseline was the date of hospital admission and the primary endpoint was death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received BZRAs and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, obesity and comorbidity) and other medications. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW).

ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 14.5 days (SD=18.1), the primary endpoint occurred in 186 patients (27.1%) who received a BZRA and in 1,134 patients (8.3%) who did not. There was a significant association between BZRA use and increased mortality both in the crude analysis (HR=3.20; 95% CI=2.74-3.74; p<0.01) and in the primary IPW analysis (HR=1.61; 95% CI=1.31-1.98, p<0.01), with a significant dose-dependent relationship (HR=1.55; 95% CI=1.08-2.22; p=0.02). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsBZRA use was associated with increased mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with a dose-dependent relationship, suggesting a potential benefit of decreasing dose or tapering off these medications when possible in these patients.",Nicolas Hoertel; Marina Sánchez-Rico; Erich Gulbins; Johannes Kornhuber; Raphaël Vernet; Nathanaël Beeker; Antoine Neuraz; Carlos Blanco; Mark Olfson; Guillaume Airagnes; Cédric Lemogne; Jesús M Alvarado; Michel Arnaout; Pierre Meneton; Frédéric Limosin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252004,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252004,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
205,Delivery of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein into human cells,"SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (S2-E) is a conserved membrane protein that is essential to coronavirus assembly and budding. Here, we describe the recombinant expression and purification of S2-E into amphipol-class amphipathic polymer solutions. The physical properties of amphipols underpin their ability to solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins without disrupting membranes. Amphipol delivery of S2-E to pre-formed planar bilayers results in spontaneous membrane integration and formation of viroporin ion channels. Amphipol delivery of the S2-E protein to human cells results in membrane integration followed by retrograde trafficking to a location adjacent to the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi, which are the sites of coronavirus replication. Delivery of S2-E to cells enables both chemical biological approaches for future studies of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and development of ""Trojan Horse"" anti-viral therapies.

206,Probing the SAM Binding Site of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 in vitro Using SAM Competitive Inhibitors Guides Developing Selective bi-substrate Inhibitors,"The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly brought the healthcare systems world-wide to a breaking point along with devastating socioeconomic consequences. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the disease uses RNA capping to evade the human immune system. Non-structural protein (nsp) 14 is one of the 16 nsps in SARS-CoV-2 and catalyzes the methylation of the viral RNA at N7-guanosine in the cap formation process. To discover small molecule inhibitors of nsp14 methyltransferase (MT) activity, we developed and employed a radiometric MT assay to screen a library of 161 in house synthesized S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) competitive methyltransferase inhibitors and SAM analogs. Among seven identified screening hits, SS148 inhibited nsp14 MT activity with an IC50 value of 70 {+/-} 6 nM and was selective against 20 human protein lysine methyltransferases indicating significant differences in SAM binding sites. Interestingly, DS0464 with IC50 value of 1.1 {+/-} 0.2 M showed a bi-substrate competitive inhibitor mechanism of action. Modeling the binding of this compound to nsp14 suggests that the terminal phenyl group extends into the RNA binding site. DS0464 was also selective against 28 out of 33 RNA, DNA, and protein methyltransferases. The structure-activity relationship provided by these compounds should guide the optimization of selective bi-substrate nsp14 inhibitors and may provide a path towards a novel class of antivirals against COVID-19, and possibly other coronaviruses.",Kanchan Devkota; Matthieu Schapira; Sumera Perveen; Aliakbar Khalili Yazdi; Fengling Li; Irene Chau; Pegah Ghiabi; Taraneh Hajian; Peter Loppnau; Albina Bolotokova; Karla J Satchell; Ke Wang; Deyao Li; Jing Liu; David Smil; Minkui Luo; Jian Jin; Paul V.

207,Adequate knowledge of COVID-19 impacts good practices amongst health profession students in the Philippines,"BackgroundThe spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Philippines started with its first suspected case on January 22, 2020. The government reacted by imposing several measures including community quarantine, class suspensions, drug therapy and vaccine development, and travel restrictions. This online survey was done amongst Filipino health professions undergraduate students to uncover the relationship between their knowledge, attitude, and practice during this pandemic.

MethodsCross-sectional data were obtained from an online survey done on students of medicine, dentistry, optometry, rehabilitative sciences, and pharmacy.

ResultsAt a response rate of 100% (n=1257), the results show that healthcare profession students in the Philippines have good knowledge (87.6%) and practices (63.6%) regarding COVID-19, yet attitude (63.6%) was just passable. This study also shows that a strong correlation exists between knowledge and practice concerning the current pandemic, r(2) = 0.08, P = 0.004.

209,Sexual dimorphism and plasticity in wing shape in three Diptera,"The ability of powered flight in insects facilitated their great evolutionary success allowing them to occupy various ecological niches. Beyond this primary task, wings are often involved in various premating behaviors, such as the generation of courtship songs and the initiation of mating in flight. These specific functions imply special adaptations of wing morphology, as well as sex-specific wing morphologies. Although wing morphology has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, a comprehensive understa nding of sexual wing shape dimorphisms and developmental plasticity is missing for other Diptera. Therefore, we raised flies of the three Diptera species Drosophila melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata and Musca domestica at different environmental conditions and applied geometric morphometrics to analyze wing shape. Our data showed extensive interspecific differences in wing shape, as well as a clear sexual wing shape dimorphism in all three species. We revealed an impact of different rearing temperatures wing shape in all three species, which was mostly explained by plasticity in wing size in D. melanogaster. Rearing densities had significant effects on allometric wing shape in D. melanogaster, while no obvious effects were observed for the other two species. Additionally, we do not find evidence for sex-specific response to different rearing conditions in all three species. We determined species-specific and common trends in shape alterations, and we hypothesize developmental and functional implications of our data.

Contribution to the Field StatementThe size and shape of organisms and organs must be tightly controlled during development to ensure proper functionality. However, morphological traits vary considerably in nature contributing to phenotypic diversity. Such variation can be the result of evolutionary adaptations as well as plasticity for example as reaction to changing environmental conditions during development. It is therefore a major aim in Biology to unravel the processes that control differences in adult morphology. Insect wings are excellent models to study how organ size and shape evolves because they facilitate basic tasks such as mating and feeding. Accordingly, a tremendous variety of wings sizes and shapes evolved in nature. Additionally, plasticity in wing morphology in response to different rearing conditions has been observed in many insects contributing to phenotypic diversity. In this work we applied Geometric Morphometrics to study wing shape in the three Diptera species: the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, the Vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster and the housefly Musca domestica. Flies were raised in different temperature and density regimes that allowed us to study the effects of these environmental factors on wing shape. Additionally, in accordance with different mating behaviors of these flies, we observed a clear sexual shape dimorphism in all three species. Since the three studied species represent serious pests and disease vectors, our findings may contribute to existing and future monitoring efforts.",Rongxin Zhang; Ke Xiao; Yu Gu; Hongde Liu; Xiao Sun,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135749,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135749,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,False
210,"Investigation and public health response to a COVID-19 outbreak in a rural resort community--Blaine County, Idaho, 2020","Blaine County, Idaho, a rural area with a renowned resort, experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District.

Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases occurred among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population). An additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Among the 451 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 51 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Of 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, 22 (3.9%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and an additional 29 (5.2%) experienced compatible symptoms. Sequencing results from 34 Idaho specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results.

212,Host-virus chimeric events in SARS-CoV2 infected cells are infrequent and artifactual,"Pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe SARS-CoV2 infection remain largely unelucidated. High throughput sequencing technologies that capture genome and transcriptome information are key approaches to gain detailed mechanistic insights from infected cells. These techniques readily detect both pathogen and host-derived sequences, providing a means of studying host-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have reported the presence of host-virus chimeric (HVC) RNA in RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and interpreted these findings as evidence of viral integration in the human genome as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Since SARS-CoV2 is a positive sense RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm it does not have a nuclear phase in its life cycle, it is biologically unlikely to be in a location where splicing events could result in genome integration. Here, we investigated the biological authenticity of HVC events. In contrast to true biological events such as mRNA splicing and genome rearrangement events, which generate reproducible chimeric sequencing fragments across different biological isolates, we found that HVC events across >100 RNA-seq libraries from patients with COVID-19 and infected cell lines, were highly irreproducible. RNA-seq library preparation is inherently error-prone due to random template switching during reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA. By counting chimeric events observed when constructing an RNA-seq library from human RNA and spike-in RNA from an unrelated species, such as fruit-fly, we estimated that ~1% of RNA-seq reads are artifactually chimeric. In SARS-CoV2 RNA-seq we found that the frequency of HVC events was, in fact, not greater than this background ""noise"". Finally, we developed a novel experimental approach to enrich SARS-CoV2 sequences from bulk RNA of infected cells. This method enriched viral sequences but did not enrich for HVC events, suggesting that the majority of HVC events are, in all likelihood, artifacts of library construction. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HVC events observed in RNA-sequencing libraries from SARS-CoV2 infected cells are extremely rare and are likely artifacts arising from either random template switching of reverse-transcriptase and/or sequence alignment errors. Therefore, the observed HVC events do not support SARS-CoV2 fusion to cellular genes and/or integration into human genomes.",Bingyu Yan; Srishti Chakravorty; Carmen Mirabelli; Luopin Wang; Jorge L.

213,Increased hazard of mortality in cases compatible with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1 - a matched cohort study,"ObjectivesTo establish whether there is any change in mortality associated with infection of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 (VOC-202012/1), first detected in UK in December 2020, compared to that associated with infection with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

DesignMatched cohort study. Cases are matched by age, gender, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimen, and differing only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay - a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection.

SettingUnited Kingdom, Pillar 2 COVID-19 testing centres using the taqPath assay.

Participants54,773 pairs of participants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Pillar 2 between 1st October 2020 and 29th January 2021.

Main outcome measures - Death within 28 days of first positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

ResultsThere is a high probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 (p <0.001). The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared to infection with previously circulating variants is 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 - 2.2) in patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase of deaths from 1.8 in 1000 to 3.1 in 1000 detected cases.

ConclusionsIf this finding is generalisable to other populations, VOC-202012/1 infections have the potential to cause substantial additional mortality over and previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning, national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.",Robert Challen; Ellen Brooks-Pollock; Jonathan M Read; Louise Dyson; Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova; Leon Danon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250937,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250937,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True

Colchicine exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by tubulin disruption and inhibition of leucocyte-mediated inflammatory activities like production of superoxide and release of various cytokines which are central to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the currently available data on the use of colchicine for the treatment of COVIDLJ19. A total of 3 studies (2 RCTS and 1 observational study) including 402 patients were included out of which 194 patients received colchicine.

215,Lockdown and non-COVID-19 deaths: Cause-specific mortality during the first wave of the 2020 pandemic in Norway. A population-based register study,"ObjectiveTo explore the potential impact of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on all cause and cause-specific mortality in Norway.

DesignPopulation based register study.

SettingThe Norwegian cause of Death Registry and the National Population Register of Norway.

ParticipantsAll recorded deaths in Norway during March to May from 2010 to 2020.

Main outcome measuresRate (per 100 000) of all-cause mortality and causes of death in the EU Shortlist for Causes of Death March to May 2020. The rates were age-standardised and adjusted to a 100% register coverage and compared with a 95% prediction interval (PI) based on corresponding rates for 2010-2019.

Results113 710 deaths were included, of which 10 226 from 2020. We did not observe any deviation from predicted total mortality. There were fewer than predicted deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases excluding asthma (11.4, 95% PI 11.8 to 15.2) and from other non-ischemic, non-rheumatic heart diseases (13.9, 95% PI 14.5 to 20.2). The death rates were higher than predicted for Alzheimers disease (7.3, 95% PI 5.5 to 7.3) and diabetes mellitus (4.1, 95% PI 2.1 to 3.4).

ConclusionsThere was no significant difference in the frequency of the major causes of death in the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. An increase in diabetes mellitus deaths and reduced mortality due to some heart and lung conditions may be linked to infection control measures.",Guttorm Raknes; Marianne Sorlie Strom; Gerhard Sulo; Simon Nygaard Overland; Mathieu Roelants; Petur Benedikt Juliusson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251326,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251326,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
216,The Effect of NFL and NCAA Football Games on the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States: An Empirical Analysis,"ImportanceIn 2020 and early 2021, the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had opted to host games in stadiums across the country. The in-person attendance of games has varied with time and from county to county. There is currently no evidence on whether limited in-person attendance of games has caused a substantial increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether NFL and NCAA football games with limited in-person attendance have contributed to a substantial increase in COVID-19 cases in the counties they were held.

DesignIn this time-series cross-sectional study, we matched every county hosting game(s) with in-person attendance (treated) in 2020 and 2021 with a county that has an identical game history for up to 14 days (control). We employed a standard matching method to further refine this matched set so that the treated and matched control counties have similar population size, non-pharmaceutical intervention(s) in place, and COVID-19 trends. We assessed the effect of hosting games with in-person attendance using a difference-in-difference estimator.

SettingU.S. counties.

ParticipantsU.S. counties hosting NFL and/or NCAA games.

ExposureHosting NFL and/or NCAA games.

Main outcomes and measuresEstimating the impact of NFL and NCAA games with in-person attendance on new, reported COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents at the county-level up to 14 days post-game.

ResultsThe matching algorithm returned 361 matching sets of counties. The effect of in-person attendance at NFL and NCAA games on community COVID-19 spread is not significant as it did not surpass 5 new daily cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents on average.

Conclusions and relevanceThis time-series, cross-sectional matching study with a difference-in-differences design did not find an increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the counties where NFL and NCAA games were held with in-person attendance. Our study suggests that NFL and NCAA football games hosted with limited in-person attendance do not cause a significant increase in local COVID-19 cases.

217,A comparison of performance metrics for cloth face masks as source control devices for simulated cough and exhalation aerosols,"Universal mask wearing is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help control the spread of COVID-19. Masks reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols (called source control) and offer some protection to the wearer. However, masks vary greatly in their designs and construction materials, and it is not clear which are most effective. Our study tested 15 reusable cloth masks (which included face masks, neck gaiters, and bandanas), two medical masks, and two N95 filtering facepiece respirators as source control devices for aerosols [&le;] 7 {micro}m produced during simulated coughing and exhalation. These measurements were compared with the mask filtration efficiencies, airflow resistances, and fit factors. The source control collection efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 17% to 71% for coughing and 35% to 66% for exhalation. The filtration efficiencies of the cloth masks ranged from 1.4% to 98%, while the fit factors were 1.3 to 7.4 on an elastomeric manikin headform and 1.0 to 4.0 on human test subjects. The correlation coefficients between the source control efficacies and the other performance metrics ranged from 0.31 to 0.66 and were significant in all but one case. However, none of the alternative metrics were strong predictors of the source control performance of cloth masks. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the relationships between source control performance and metrics like filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and fit factor are needed to develop simple methods to estimate the effectiveness of masks as source control devices for respiratory aerosols.",William G Lindsley; Francoise M Blachere; Donald H Beezhold; Brandon F Law; Raymond C Derk; Justin M Hettick; Karen Woodfork; William T Goldsmith; James R Harris; Matthew G Duling; Brenda Boutin; Timothy Nurkiewicz; John D Noti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251850,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251850,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True

This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables.

219,"Evaluating social and spatial inequalities of large scale rapid lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing in COVID-19 management: An observational study of Liverpool, UK (November 2020 to January 2021)","ObjectiveTo explore social and spatial inequalities in uptake and case-detection of rapid lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests (LFTs) offered to people without symptoms of COVID-19.

DesignObservational study.

SettingLiverpool, UK.

Participants496 784 residents.

InterventionFree LFTs to all people living and working in Liverpool (6th November 2020 to 31st January 2021).

Main outcome measuresResidents who received a LFT, residents who had multiple LFTs, and positive test results.

Results214 525 residents (43%) received a LFT identifying 5557 individuals as positive cases of COVID-19 (1.3%) between 6th November 2020 and 31st January 2021. 89 047 residents had more than one test (18%). Uptake was highest in November when there was military assistance. High uptake was observed again in the week preceding Christmas and was sustained into a national lockdown. Overall uptake and repeat testing were lower among males (e.g. 40% uptake over the whole period), Black Asian and other Minority Ethnic groups (e.g. 27% uptake for  Mixed ethnicity) and in the most deprived areas (e.g. 32% uptake in most deprived areas). These population groups were also more likely to have received positive tests for COVID-19. Spatial regression models demonstrated that uptake and repeat testing were lower in areas of higher deprivation, areas located further from test sites and areas containing populations less confident in the using Internet technologies. Positive tests were spatially clustered in deprived areas.

ConclusionsLarge-scale voluntary asymptomatic community testing saw social, ethnic, and spatial inequalities in an  inverse care pattern, but with an added digital exclusion factor. COVID-19 testing and support to isolate need to be more accessible to the vulnerable communities most impacted by the pandemic, including non-digital means of access.

220,Modafinil for Wakefulness in the Critical Care Units: A Case Series including COVID-19 Patients at a Tertiary Care Saudi Hospital,"Cognitive improvement after critical illness is complex. Neuro-stimulants are used to speed up physical and mental processes through the increase in arousal, and wakefulness. In this case series, we reviewed the literature and described the effect of modafinil for wakefulness in a cohort of adult patients admitted to our COVID and non-COVID intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2017 and June 2020. A total of 8 patients included; 3 admitted to COVID-19, 4 surgical, and 1 transplant ICU. Obstructive sleep apnea was noted in 2 (25%), 2 patients (25 %) had an initial neuroimaging that showed hemorrhagic stroke, and 1 (12.5%) showed ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation. Modafinil 100-200 mg daily was started for a median duration of 4 days and the median initiation time in relation to ICU admission was 11 (IQR 9-17) days. Glasgow coma Scale improvement was noted on 5 patients (62.5%). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 17.5 (IQR 15-31.75) days, and the median ICU stay was 28.5 (IQR 20.25-48) days. All-cause mortality rate was 25 % at 28 days and 62.5 % at 90 days. Modafinil prevented tracheostomy in 1 COVID-19 patient. No significant adverse drug reactions were documented. In our case series, we described our experience for modafinil use for wakefulness in ICU ventilated patients including COVID-19 patients. Based on our observations, the known effects of modafinil, and its safety profile, it holds the potential to facilitate recovery from cognitive impairment.

221,Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Case Growth Highlights Evolving Demographic Risk Factors in Tennessee and Georgia,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the need to understand the unique risk drivers that contribute to uneven morbidity and mortality in US communities. Addressing the community-specific social determinants of health that correlate with spread of SARS-CoV-2 provides an opportunity for targeted public health intervention to promote greater resilience to viral respiratory infections in the future.

Our work combined publicly available COVID-19 statistics with county-level social determinants of health information. Machine learning models were trained to predict COVID-19 case growth and understand the unique social, physical and environmental risk factors associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tennessee and Georgia counties. Model accuracy was assessed comparing predicted case counts to actual positive case counts in each county. The predictive models achieved a mean r-squared (R2) of 0.998 in both states with accuracy above 90% for all time points examined. Using these models, we tracked the social determinants of health, with a specific focus on demographics, that were strongly associated with COVID-19 case growth in Tennessee and Georgia counties. The demographic results point to dynamic racial trends in both states over time and varying, localized patterns of risk among counties within the same state.

Healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in single and multi-site hospital-based studies in England, but not nationally.

MethodsAdmission records for all hospitals in England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 national test data for the period 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020. Case definitions were: community-onset community-acquired (CO.CA), first positive test (FPT) <14 days pre-admission, up to day 2 of admission; hospital-onset indeterminate healthcare-associated (HO.iHA), FPT on day 3-7; hospital-onset probable healthcare-associated (HO.pHA), FPT on day 8-14; hospital-onset definite healthcare-associated (HO.HA), FPT from day 15 of admission until discharge; community-onset possible healthcare-associated (CO.pHA), FPT [&le;]14 days post-discharge.

ResultsOne-third (34.4%, 100,859/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were linked to a hospital record. HO.pHA and HO.HA cases represented 5.3% (15,564/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed cases and 15.4% (15,564/100,859) of laboratory-confirmed cases among hospital patients. CO.CA and CO.pHA cases represented 86.5% (253,582/293,204) and 5.1% (14,913/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed cases, respectively.

ConclusionsUp to 1 in 6 SARS-CoV-2 infections among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in England during the first 6 months of the pandemic could be attributed to nosocomial transmission, but these represent less than 1% of the estimated 3 million COVID-19 cases in this period.",Alex Bhattacharya; Simon M Collin; James Stimson; Simon Thelwall; Olisaeloka Nsonwu; Sarah Gerver; Julie Robotham; Mark Wilcox; Susan Hopkins; Russell Hope,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251625,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251625,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True

MethodsSpecimens from the greater El Paso area were processed in the Dascena COVID-19 Laboratory. Daily median CT value, daily transmission rate R(t), daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, daily change in percent positivity, and rolling averages of these features were plotted over time. Two-way scatterplots and linear regression evaluated possible associations between daily median CT and outbreak measures. Cross-correlation plots determined whether a time delay existed between changes in the daily median CT value and measure of community disease dynamics.

ResultsDaily median CT was negatively correlated with the daily R(t), the daily COVID-19 hospitalization count (with a time delay), and the daily change in percent positivity among testing samples. Despite visual trends suggesting time delays in the plots for median CT and outbreak measures, a statistically significant delay was only detected between changes in median CT and COVID-19 hospitalization count.

226,The rise of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Israel intensifies the role of surveillance and vaccination in elderly,"Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic various generic variants have been described. Of specific interest is a new variant, which was observed in England during December 2020 and is now termed B.1.1.7. This variant is now associated with increased infectivity and therefore its spread within the community is of great importance. The Israeli government established three noteworthy programs namely, mass PCR testing, focused protection of the elderly and more recently an unparalleled prioritized vaccination program. In this study we analyzed primary data of >300,000 RT-PCR samples collected throughout December 6th 2020 until February 10th 2021 in the general community and nursing homes. We identified that within a period of six weeks, the B.1.1.7 variant was capable of out competing the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 strain to become the main strain. Furthermore, we show that the transmission of B.1.1.7 in the 60+ population reached a near complete halt, due to an ongoing surveillance testing program in nursing homes and the vaccination program of Israel. Thus, proactive protection programs such as routine surveillance and monitoring of populations at risk combined with prioritized vaccination, is achievable and will result in a reduction of severe illness and subsequent death.",Ariel Munitz; Matan Yechezkel; Yoav Dickstein; Dan Yamin; Motti Gerlic,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251819,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251819,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True

We identified both space-time (SaTScan) and transmission (MST-DBSCAN) clusters; we estimated their duration, their transmission behavior (emergence, growth, reduction, etc.) and relative risk. For each cluster, we computed the within number of individuals, their median age and viral load.

Among 1684 space-time clusters identified, 457 (27.1%) were significant (p [&le;] 0.05), i.e. harboring a higher relative risk of infection, as compared to other regions. They lasted a median of 11 days (IQR 7-13) and included a median of 12 individuals per cluster (IQR 5-20). The majority of significant clusters (n=260; 56.9 %) had at least one person with an extremely high viral load (above 1 billion copies/ml). Those clusters were considerably larger (median of 17 infected individuals, p < 0.001) than clusters with subjects showing a viral load lower than 1 million copies/ml (median of 3 infected individuals). The highest viral loads were found in clusters with the lowest average age, while clusters with the highest average age had low to middle viral load. Interestingly, in 20 significant clusters the viral load of three first cases were all below 100000 copies/ml suggesting that subjects with less than 100000 copies/ml may still have been contagious. Noteworthy, the dynamics of transmission clusters made it possible to identify three diffusion zones, which mainly differentiated rural from urban areas, the latter being more prone to last and spread in a new nearby clusters.

The use of geographic information is key for public health decision makers to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators (cytokine storm) by activated immune cells in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 leads to severe phenotype development.

AimThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the inflammatory cytokines profile associated with severe human coronavirus diseases, including three stains: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2, in severe patients.

MethodPubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2020. Randomized and Observational studies reporting the inflammatory cytokines associated with severe and non-severe human coronavirus diseases, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the pooled mean of inflammatory biomarkers.

ResultsA high level of circulating IL-6 could be associated with the severity of the three strains of coronaviruses infection. TNF, IL-10, and IL-8 is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Increased circulating levels of CXCL10/IP10 and CCL2/MCP-1 might also be related to the severity of MERS.

ConclusionThis study suggests that the immune response and immunopathology in the three severe human coronavirus strains are similar to some extent. These findings highlight that nearly all studies reporting severe cases of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have been associated with elevated levels of IL-6, which could be used as a potential therapeutic target to improve patients outcomes in severe cases.",Ayat Zawawi; Abdallah Y Naser; Hassan Alwafi; Faisal Minsahwi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251673,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251673,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
229,Densely sampled viral trajectories suggest longer duration of acute infection with B.1.1.7 variant relative to non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2,"To test whether acute infection with B.1.1.7 is associated with higher or more sustained nasopharyngeal viral concentrations, we assessed longitudinal PCR tests performed in a cohort of 65 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing daily surveillance testing, including seven infected with B.1.1.7. For individuals infected with B.1.1.7, the mean duration of the proliferation phase was 5.3 days (90% credible interval [2.7, 7.8]), the mean duration of the clearance phase was 8.0 days [6.1, 9.9], and the mean overall duration of infection (proliferation plus clearance) was 13.3 days [10.1, 16.5]. These compare to a mean proliferation phase of 2.0 days [0.7, 3.3], a mean clearance phase of 6.2 days [5.1, 7.1], and a mean duration of infection of 8.2 days [6.5, 9.7] for non-B.1.1.7 virus. The peak viral concentration for B.1.1.7 was 19.0 Ct [15.8, 22.0] compared to 20.2 Ct [19.0, 21.4] for non-B.1.1.7. This converts to 8.5 log10 RNA copies/ml [7.6, 9.4] for B.1.1.7 and 8.2 log10 RNA copies/ml [7.8, 8.5] for non-B.1.1.7. These data offer evidence that SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 may cause longer infections with similar peak viral concentration compared to non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. This extended duration may contribute to B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2s increased transmissibility.",Stephen M Kissler; Joseph R Fauver; Christina Mack; Caroline Tai; Mallery Breban; Anne E.

230,Mortality in COVID-19 amongst women on Hormone Replacement Therapy or Combined Oral Contraception: A cohort study,"ObjectiveTo investigate the association between Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) or Combined Oral Contraception (COCP) use, and the likelihood of death in women with COVID-19.

DesignA cohort study

Setting465 general practices in England within the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care database.

Population1,863,478 women aged over 18 years

MethodsWe identified a cohort of women with COVID-19 from the computerised medical records of the RCGP RSC database. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between HRT or COCP use, and all-cause mortality among women with COVID-19 in unadjusted and adjusted models.

ResultsThere were 5451 COVID-19 cases within the cohort. HRT was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.22, 95%{square}CI 0.05 to 0.94). There were no reported events for all-cause mortality in women prescribed COCPs. This prevented further examination of the impact of COCP.

ConclusionsWomen on HRT with COVID-19 had a lower likelihood of death. Further work is needed in larger cohorts to examine the association of COCP in COVID-19. Our findings support the current hypothesis that oestrogens may contribute a protective effect against COVID-19 severity.

231,SEIR Filter: A Stochastic Model of Epidemic,"There are many epidemiological models at hand to cope with the present pandemic; it is, however, difficult to calibrate these models when data are noisy, partial or observed only indirectly. It is also difficult to distinguish relevant data from noise, and to distinguish the impact of individual determinants of the epidemic.

In mathematical statistics, the tools to handle all of these phenomena exist; however, they are seldom used for epidemiological models. The goal of this paper is to start filling this gap by proposing a general stochastic epidemiological model, which we call SEIR Filter.

Technically our model is a heterogeneous partially observable vector autoregression model, in which we are able to express closed form formulas for the distribution of compartments and observations, so both maximum likelihood and least square estimators are analytically tractable. We give conditions for vanishing, explosion and stationary behaviour of the epidemic and we are able to express a closed form formula for reproduction number.

Finally, we present several examples of the models application. We construct an estimate age-cohort model of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic.

232,When efficacy and adherence conflict: preferences and patterns of response to public health advice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"With recurring waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, a dilemma facing public health leadership is whether to provide public advice that is medically optimal (e.g., most protective against infection if followed), but unlikely to be adhered to, or advice that is less protective but is more likely to be followed. To provide insight about this dilemma, we examined and quantified public perceptions about the tradeoff between (a) the stand-alone value of health behavior advice, and (b) the advices adherence likelihood. In a series of studies about preference for public health leadership advice, we asked 1,061 participants to choose between (1) strict advice that is medically optimal if adhered to but which is less likely to be broadly followed, and (2) relaxed advice, which is less medically effective but more likely to gain adherence - given varying infection expectancies. Participants preference was consistent with risk aversion. Offering an informed choice alternative that shifts volition to advice recipients only strengthened risk aversion, but also demonstrated that informed choice was preferred as much or more than the risk-averse strict advice.",Oded Nov; Graham Dove; Martina Balestra; Katharine Lawrence; Devin Mann; Batia Wiesenfeld,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251765,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251765,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
233,Incidence and Outcomes of Pulmonary embolism among hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundPatients with COVID-19 may be at high risk for thrombotic complications due to excess inflammatory response and stasis of blood flow. This study aims to assess the incidence of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, risk factors and the impact on survival.

MethodA retrospective case-control study was conducted at Al-Noor Specialist Hospital in, Saudi Arabia between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by Computed Tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) formed the case group. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and without confirmed diagnose of pulmonary embolism formed the control group. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of pulmonary embolism and its survival.

ResultsA total of 159 patients participated were included in the study, of which 51 were the cases (patients with pulmonary embolism) and 108 patients formed the control group (patients without pulmonary embolism). The incidence of PE among hospitalized was around 32%. Smoking history, low level of oxygen saturation and higher D-dimer values were important risk factors that were associated with a higher risk of developing PE (p< 0.05). Higher respiratory rate was associated with higher odds of death, and decrease the possibility of survival among hospitalised patients with PE.

ConclusionPulmonary embolism is common among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

234,Worries about COVID-19 infection and psychological distress at work and while commuting,"ObjectiveThis study examined the relationship between worry about COVID-19 infection in general, in the workplace and while commuting to work and psychological distress in the midst of a rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Japan.

MethodsThis cross-sectional, internet monitor study was conducted on December 22- 26, 2020. Subjects were collected from throughout Japan. Out of a total of 33,302 participants, 26,841 people were included in the study after removing those providing fraudulent responses. The subjects were asked single-item questions about whether they were worried about COVID-19 infection in general, at work and while commuting to work. Kessler 6 (K6) was used to assess psychological distress. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with worry about infection were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustment for sex, age, education, equivalent household income, occupation, number of business establishments, smoking status, alcohol consumption, frequency of telecommuting, use of public transportation, perceived assessment of workplace infection control efforts, presence of infection among acquaintances, and experience of being a close contact. Psychological distress was defined as a K6 score of 5 or higher and 13 or higher.

ResultsMultivariate analysis showed that the OR of severe psychological distress associated with general worry about COVID-19 infection was 1.10 (95% CI 1.00-1.22). The OR was significantly higher in association with worry about infection in the workplace at 1.71 (95%CI 1.53-1.92) and worry about infection while commuting at 1.49 (95%CI 1.32-1.67).

236,Evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on dispensing patterns: a national cohort analysis,"BackgroundMedication prescribing and dispensing often regarded as one of the most effective ways to manage and improve population health. Prescribed and dispensed medications can be monitored through data linkage for each patient. We hypothesised that changes in patient care resulting from COVID-19, changed the way patients access their prescribed medication.

ObjectiveTo develop an efficient approach for evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on drug dispensing patterns.

MethodsRetrospective observational study using national patient-level dispensing records in Wales-UK. Total dispensed drug items between 01-Jan-2016 and 31-Dec-2019 (counterfactual pre-COVID-19) were compared to 2020 (COVID-19 year). We compared trends of dispensed items in three main British National Formulary (BNF) sections(Cardiovascular system, Central Nervous System, Immunological & Vaccine) using European Age-Standardized rates. We developed an online tool to enable monitoring of changes in dispensing as the pandemic evolves.

ResultAmongst all BNF chapters, 52,357,639 items were dispensed in 2020 compared to 49,747,141 items in 2019 demonstrating a relative increase of 5.25% in 2020(95%CI[5.21,5.29]). Comparison of monthly patterns of 2020 and 2019 dispensed items showed a notable difference between the total number of dispensed drug items each month, with an average difference (D) of +290,055 and average Relative Change (RC) of +5.52%. The greatest RC was observed in a substantial March-2020 increase (D=+1,501,242 and RC=+28%), followed by second peak in June (D=+565,004, RC=+10.97%). May was characterised by lower dispensing (D=-399,244, RC=-5.9%). Cardiovascular categories were characterised, across all age groups, by dramatic March-2020 increases, at the epidemic peak, followed by months of lower than expected dispensing, and gradual recovery by September. The Central Nervous System category was similar, but with only a short decline in May, and quicker recovery. A stand-out grouping was Immunological and Vaccine, which dropped to very low levels across all age groups, and all months (including the March dispensing peak).

ConclusionsAberration in clinical service delivery during COVID-19 led to substantial changes in community pharmacy drug dispensing. This change may contribute to a long-term burden of COVID-19, raising the importance of a comprehensive and timely monitoring of changes for evaluation of the potential impact on clinical care and outcomes",Fatemeh Torabi; Ashley Akbari; Laura North; Daniel Harris; Gareth Davies; Mike Gravenor; Rowena Griffiths; Jane Lyons; Neil Jenkins; Andrew Morris; Julian Halcox; Ronan A.

237,'Trained immunity' from Mycobacterium spp. (environmental or BCG) exposure predicts protection from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Endeavors to identify protective variables that could be potentially responsible for reduced COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within the first 5 years of life while most of the COVID-19 cases as well as deaths have been observed in adults especially the aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed desired protection being investigated could come from heterologous  trained immunity conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. (i.e., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of  trained immunity of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) of populations would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four) as well as erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher trained immunity prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower trained immunity prevalence neighbors. The incidences, mortality, and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) of COVID-19 are found negatively correlated with the trained immunity of populations that have comparable underlying confounders not the BCG coverage per se. It is submitted that to decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit that can be gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of trained immunity as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b) small study groups of higher background trained immunity could fail to indicate any protective effect.",Samer Singh; Rakesh K Singh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.20233593,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.20233593,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
238,"The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autolysed samples from an exhumed decomposed body: Implications to virus survival, genome stability, and spatial distribution in tissues","Here we report for the first time the SARS-CoV-2 detection in autolysed samples from an exhumed decomposed body post-thirty six days after death. Both naso-oropharyngeal swabs and visceral samples from the lung, intestine, liver, and kidney were collected from the body exhumed post-fifteen days after burial, stored in viral transport medium and in saturated salt solution respectively. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs showed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome as identified by the amplification of viral E, N, RdRP, or ORF1ab genes by RT-PCR. Subsequent examination of tissues reveal the detection of the virus genome in the intestine and liver, while no detection in the kidney and lung. These results signify the genome stability and implicate the virus survival in decomposed swab samples and in tissues and thereafter in storage solution. Further results also indicate spatial distribution of the virus in tissues during the early stage of infection in the subject with no respiratory distress. Considering the presence of cool, humid, and moist location of the exhumation, the presence of virus genome might also indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can persist for more than seven days on the surface of dead bodies similar to the Ebola virus, confirming that transmission from deceased subjects is possible for an extended period after death. These results further reaffirm the robustness of the RT-PCR aiding in the detection of viruses or their genome in decomposed samples when other methods of detection could not be useful.",Mahadeshwara Prasad; Somanna Ajjamada Nachappa; Niveditha Anand; Deepika Udayawara Rudresh; Yashika Singh; Surabhi P.

239,IMMUNO-COV™ v2.0: Development and Validation of a High-Throughput Clinical Assay for Measuring SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Antibody Titers,"Neutralizing antibodies are key determinants of protection from future infection, yet well-validated high-throughput assays for measuring titers of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are not generally available. Here we describe the development and validation of IMMUNO-COV v2.0 a scalable surrogate virus assay, which titrates antibodies that block infection of Vero-ACE2 cells by a luciferase-encoding vesicular stomatitis virus displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (VSV-SARS2-Fluc). Antibody titers, calculated using a standard curve consisting of stepped concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody, correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with titers obtained from a gold-standard PRNT50% assay performed using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. IMMUNO-COV v2.0 was comprehensively validated using data acquired from 242 assay runs performed over seven days by five analysts, utilizing two separate virus lots, and 176 blood samples. Assay performance was acceptable for clinical use in human serum and plasma based on parameters including linearity, dynamic range, limit of blank and limit of detection, dilutional linearity and parallelism, precision, clinical agreement, matrix equivalence, clinical specificity and sensitivity, and robustness. Sufficient VSV-SARS2-Fluc virus reagent has been banked to test 5 million clinical samples. Notably, a significant drop in IMMUNO-COV v2.0 neutralizing antibody titers was observed over a six-month period in people recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of IMMUNO-COV v2.0 for measuring SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals and those recovering from natural infections. Such monitoring can be used to better understand what levels of neutralizing antibodies are required for protection from SARS-CoV-2, and what booster dosing schedules are needed to sustain vaccine-induced immunity.",Rianna Vandergaast; Timothy Carey; Samantha Reiter; Chase Lathrum; Patrycja Lech; Clement Gnanadurai; Michelle Haselton; Jason Buehler; Riya Narjari; Luke Schnebeck; Anne Roesler; Kara Sevola; Lukkana Suksanpaisan; Alice Bexon; Shruthi Naik; Bethany Brunton; Scott C.

240,Use of convalescent plasma in patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19): Systematic review and meta-analysis,"ObjetivesTo assess the effects of convalescent plasma treatment in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Study designSystematic review and Meta-analysis

Data sourcesA systematic search was carried out on the L {middle dot} OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19 until October 31, 2020

Study selectionRandomized clinical trials in which people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 were randomized to drug treatment, standard care, or placebo. Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles.

MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines were followed for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2.0, and the certainty of the evidence using the recommendation assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach. For each outcome, the interventions were classified into groups, from most to least beneficial or harmful.

ResultsWe identified 10 RCTs (randomized controlled trials) involving 11854 patients in which convalescent plasma was compared with standard of care or other treatments. The results of five RCTs that evaluated the use of convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19 did not show significant differences in the effect on mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

ConclusionsCurrent evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of moderate or severe COVID-19.

As of the time of writing, the disease caused by this virus (known as COVID-19) has already resulted in over 2 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths, however, have been highly unevenly distributed among age groups, sexes, countries, and jurisdictions over the course of the pandemic.

242,The impact of COVID-19 on children with oesophageal atresia and/or tracheo-oesophageal fistula (OA/TOF),"PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global health crisis of unparalleled magnitude. The direct risk to the health of children is low. However, disease containment measures have society-wide impacts. This study explored the pandemic experiences of parents of children with oesophageal atresia/tracheo-oesophageal fistula in the UK.

DesignAn online forum was conducted using a private group on Facebook, in collaboration with a patient support group. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes.

ResultsThe online forum ran between 7th November-18th December 2020 with 109 participants. Themes related to healthcare and non-healthcare impacts. Parents experienced changes and limitations to healthcare access, anxiety regarding health risks, ""collateral"" damage to well-being because of isolation and an impact on finances and employment. Parents described a transition from worry about direct health risks to concern about the impact of isolation on socialisation and development. A process of risk-benefit analysis led some to transition to a more ""normal life"", while others continued to isolate. Benefits to their childs health from isolation, positive experiences with remote healthcare and a gradual easing of anxiety were also identified.

Implications and relevanceThis study highlights the wide-ranging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and their families. Although focussed on oesophageal atresia/tracheo-oesophageal fistula, the emerging themes will be relevant to many children with complex, chronic health conditions.

243,Antimicrobial use in COVID-19 patients in the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Rapid review and evidence synthesis,"BackgroundAs the numbers of people with COVID-19 continue to increase globally, concerns have been raised regarding the widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 patients and its consequences for antimicrobial resistance during the pandemic and beyond. The scale and determinants of antibiotic use in the early phase of the pandemic, and whether antibiotic prescribing is beneficial to treatment effectiveness in COVID-19 patients, are still unknown. Unwarranted treatment of this viral infection with antibiotics may exacerbate the problem of antibiotic resistance, while antibiotic resistance may render presumptive treatment of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients ineffective.

MethodsThis rapid review was undertaken to identify studies reporting antimicrobial use in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The review was conducted to comply with PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews (http://www.prisma-statement.org/Extensions/ScopingReviews) and the protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): http://osf.io/vp6t5. The following databases: Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, CNKI & VIP were searched to identify the relevant studies from 1 Dec 2019 up to 15 June 2020; no limits were set on the language or the country where studies were conducted. The search terms used were: ((""Covid-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" or ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2"") and ((""antibiotic prescribing"" or ""antibiotic use"" or ""antibiotic*"") or ""antimicrobial *"" or ""antimicrobial therapy"" or ""antimicrobial resistance"" or ""antimicrobial stewardship"")). A total of 1216 records were identified through database searching and 118 clinical studies met the inclusion criteria and were taken into data extraction. A bespoke data extraction form was developed and validated through two independent, duplicate extraction of data from five Records. As all the included studies were descriptive in nature, we conducted descriptive synthesis of data and reported pooled estimates such as mean, percentage and frequency. We created a series of scenarios to capture the range of rationales for antibiotic prescribing presented in the included studies.

ResultsOur results show that during the early phase of the pandemic, 8501 out of 10 329 COVID-19 patients (82{middle dot}3%) were prescribed antibiotics; antibiotics were prescribed for COVID-19 patients regardless of reported severity, with a similar mean antibiotic prescribing rate between patients with severe or critical illness (75{middle dot}4%) and patients with mild or moderate illness (75{middle dot}1%). The top five frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised COVID-19 patients were azithromycin (28{middle dot}0 % of studies), ceftriaxone (17{middle dot}8%), moxifloxacin (14{middle dot}4%), meropenem (14{middle dot}4%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12{middle dot}7%). The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics without clinical justification was 51{middle dot}5% vs 41{middle dot}9 % for patients with mild or moderate illness and those with severe or critical illness respectively. Comparison of patients who were provided antibiotics with a clinical justification with those who were given antibiotics without clinical justification showed lower mortality rates (9{middle dot}5% vs 13{middle dot}1%), higher discharge rates (80{middle dot}9% vs 69{middle dot}3%) and shorter length of hospital of stay (9{middle dot}3 days vs 12{middle dot}2 days). Only 9{middle dot}7% of patients in our included studies were reported to have secondary infections.

ConclusionsAntibiotics were prescribed indiscriminately for hospitalised COVID-19 patients regardless of severity of illness during the early phase of the pandemic. COVID-19 related concerns and lack of knowledge drove a large proportion of antibiotic use without specific clinical justification. Although we are still in the midst of the pandemic, the goals of antimicrobial stewardship should remain unchanged for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.",Wenjuan Cong; Narayan Poudel; Nour Alhusein; Hexing Wang; Guiqing Yao; Helen Lambert,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251932,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251932,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
244,"Knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations: a cross-sectional community survey in Bangladesh","BackgroundSeveral vaccines have been approved against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and distributed globally in different regions. However, general community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations are poorly understood. Thus, the study aimed to investigate community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations in Bangladesh.

MethodsAn exploratory and anonymous population-based e-survey was conducted among 1658 general individuals (55.6% male; mean age=23.17{+/-}6.05 years; age range=18-65 years). The survey was conducted using a semi-structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with four sections (i.e., socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions). Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the variables predicting knowledge, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations.

ResultsThe mean scores of knowledge and attitudes were 2.83{+/-}1.48 (out of 5) and 9.34{+/-}2.39 (out of 12) respectively. About a quarter of participants thought that the COVID-19 vaccination available in Bangladesh is safe, only 60% will have the vaccination and about two-thirds will recommend it to family and friends. In the multiple regression model, higher SES, having university/ higher levels of education, holding nuclear families and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake were associated with knowledge; whilst attitudes were significantly associated with being female and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake. Just over half of the participants thought that everyone should be vaccinated and 61% responded that health workers should be vaccinated first on priority basis. 95% vaccine should be administered free of charge in Bangladesh and almost 90% believed that the COVID-19 vaccine used in Bangladesh may have side effects.

ConclusionsThe findings reflect inadequate knowledge but more positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Bangladesh. In order to improve knowledge, immediate health education programs need to be initiated before mass vaccination schedule.",Md.Saiful Islam; Abu Bakkar Siddique; Rejina Akter; Rafia Tasnim; Md.

245,Experiences of supported isolation in returning travellers during the early COVID-19 response: an interview study,"ObjectivesTo understand the experiences of those who underwent supported isolation as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, after returning to the UK from Wuhan, China.

DesignWe used semi-structured interviews to capture participants experiences and perceptions of supported isolation.

SettingTelephone interviews carried out within approximately one month of an individual leaving supported isolation.

Participants26 people who underwent supported isolation at either Arrowe Park Hospital (n = 18) or Kents Hill Park Conference Centre (n = 8) after being repatriated from Wuhan in January - February 2020.

ResultsParticipants were willing to undergo supported isolation because they understood that it would protect themselves and others. Positive treatment by staff was fundamental to participants willingness to comply with isolation procedures. Despite the high level of compliance, participants expressed some uncertainty about what the process would involve.

ConclusionsAs hotel quarantine is introduced across the UK for international arrivals, our findings suggest that those in charge should: communicate effectively before, during and after quarantine, emphasising why quarantine is important and how it will protect others; avoid enforcement and focus on supporting and promoting voluntary compliance; facilitate shared social experiences for those in quarantine; and ensure all necessary supplies are provided.

246,Associations of Race/Ethnicity and Other Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors with Vaccination During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,"BACKGROUNDTo date, there has been limited data available to understand the associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and related characteristics with COVID-19 vaccine initiation and planned vaccination in the United States. To better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations nationally, the present study leveraged nationally-representative data with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data to estimate levels of vaccine initiation and the adjusted relative odds of vaccine initiation and planned vaccination among adults by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and other characteristics.

METHODSUsing pooled cross-sectional data from 66,994 adults aged 18-85 years in nationally-representative surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau administered between January 6, 2021 and January 18, 2021 and multivariable logistic regression, this study estimated the associations between race/ethnicity, education, and pre-pandemic (2019) household income with the self-reported: 1) receipt of [&ge;]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; and 2) either receipt of [&ge;]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or the plan to definitely receive a vaccine once available to the respondent.

RESULTSIn Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics, the estimated prevalences of vaccine initiation were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to 8.7% in White non-Hispanics and 15.1% in Asian non-Hispanics. Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors, Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics were no more or less likely than White non-Hispanics to have received [&ge;]1 vaccine dose. However, for the combined outcome of either vaccine initiation or planned vaccination, Black non-Hispanics were 52% less likely than White non-Hispanics to have reported either outcome (P<.001). Meanwhile, both education and pre-pandemic income levels exhibited evidence of positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for linear trend = .01 and <.001, respectively). Substantial (vs. no) financial hardship was linked to 44% lower odds of vaccination (P<.001). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects and safety.

CONCLUSIONSIn this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data, we find that being Black non-Hispanic and having the least education and income were each independently associated with a markedly lower likelihood of definitely planning to get vaccinated or having been vaccinated. In the ensuing months of the pandemic, addressing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination due to differential access and vaccine hesitancy will be critical to mitigate the pandemics disproportionately higher risks of infection and adverse outcomes in Black non-Hispanics and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and to help maximize vaccination coverage nationwide.",Daniel Kim,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251769,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251769,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
247,COVID-BioB Cohort Study: the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic COVID-19 is persistent and critical for virus control and survival.,"Understanding how antibody to SARS-CoV-2 evolve during infection may provide important insight into therapeutic approaches to prevent fatal COVID-19 illness and vaccines. Here, we profile the antibody response of 162 well-characterized COVID-19 symptomatic patients followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset. Using two newly developed assays we detect SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and antibodies binding to Spike antigens and nucleoprotein as well as to Spike S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses, and to hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. Presence of neutralizing antibodies withing the first weeks from symptom onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p=0.002) while lack of neutralization with an increased risk of a fatal disease outcome (HR 2.918, 95%CI 1.321-6.449; p=0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities. IgG to Spike antigens are the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporary boosted and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression. Thus, a compromised immune response to the Spike rather than an enhanced one is a major trait of patients with critical conditions. Patients should be promptly identified and immediately start therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring their immunity.",Stefania Dispinseri; Massimiliano Secchi; Maria Franca Pirillo; Monica Tolazzi; Martina Borghi; Cristina Brigatti; Maria Laura De Angelis; Marco Baratella; Elena Bazzigaluppi; Giulietta Venturi; Francesca Sironi; Andrea Canitano; Ilaria Marzinotto; Cristina Tresoldi; Fabio Ciceri; Lorenzo Piemonti; Donatella Negri; Andrea Cara; Vito Lampasona; Gabriella Scarlatti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251929,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251929,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
248,Risk factors for long-term consequences of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults in Moscow using the ISARIC Global follow-up protocol: StopCOVID cohort study,"BackgroundThe long-term sequalae of COVID-19 remain poorly characterised. In this study, we aimed to assess long-standing symptoms (LS) (symptoms lasting from the time of discharge) in previously hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and assess associated risk factors.

MethodsThis is a longitudinal cohort study of adults ([&ge;]18 years of age) with clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Sechenov University Hospital Network in Moscow, Russia. Data were collected from patients discharged between April 8 and July 10, 2020. Participants were interviewed via telephone using Tier 1 ISARIC Long-term Follow-up Study CRF and the WHO CRF for Post COVID conditions. Reported symptoms were further categorised based on the system(s) involved. Additional information on dyspnoea, quality of life and fatigue was collected using validated instruments. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to investigate risk factors for development of LS categories.

FindingsOverall, 2,649 of 4,755 patients discharged from the hospitals were available for the follow-up and included in the study. The median age of the patients was 56 years (IQR, 46-66) and 1,353 (51.1%) were women. The median follow-up time since hospital discharge was 217.5 (200.4-235.5) days. At the time of the follow-up interview 1247 (47.1%) participants reported LS. Fatigue (21.2%, 551/2599), shortness of breath (14.5%, 378/2614) and forgetfulness (9.1%, 237/2597) were the most common LS reported. Chronic fatigue (25%, 658/2593) and respiratory (17.2% 451/2616) were the most common LS categories. with reporting of multi-system involvement (MSI) less common (11.3%; 299). Female sex was associated with LS categories of chronic fatigue with an odds ratio of 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.02), neurological (2.03, 1.60 to 2.58), mood and behaviour (1.83, 1.41 to 2.40), dermatological (3.26, 2.36 to 4.57), gastrointestinal (2.50, 1.64 to 3.89), sensory (1.73, 2.06 to 2.89) and respiratory (1.31, 1.06 to 1.62). Pre-existing asthma was associated with neurological (1.95, 1.25 to 2.98) and mood and behavioural changes (2.02, 1.24 to 3.18) and chronic pulmonary disease was associated with chronic fatigue (1.68, 1.21 to 2.32).

Interpretation6 to 8 months after acute infection episode almost a half of patients experience symptoms lasting since hospital discharge. One in ten individuals experiences MSI. Female sex is the main risk factor for majority of the LS categories. chronic pulmonary disease is associated with a higher risk of chronic fatigue development, and asthma with neurological and mood and behaviour changes. Individuals with LS and MSI should be the main target for future research and intervention strategies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSEvidence suggests that COVID-19 may result in short- and long-term consequences to health. Most studies do not provide definitive answers due to a combination of short follow-up (2-3 months), small sample size, and use of non-standardised tools. There is a need to study the longer-term health consequences of previously hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection and to identify risk factors for sequalae.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study (n=2,649) with the longest follow-up since hospital discharge (6-8 months) of previously hospitalised adult patients. We found that 6-8 months after discharge from the hospital, around a half (47.1%) of patients reported at least one long-standing symptom since discharge. Once categories of symptoms were assessed, chronic fatigue and respiratory problems were the most frequent clusters of long-standing symptoms in our patients. Of those patients having long-term symptoms, a smaller proportion (11.3%) had multisystem involvement, with three or more categories of long-standing symptoms present. Although most patients developed symptoms since discharge, a smaller number of individuals experienced symptom beginning symptom appearing weeks or months after the acute phase. Female sex was a predictor for most of the symptom categories at the time of the follow-up interview, with chronic pulmonary disease associated with chronic fatigue-related symptoms, and asthma with a higher risk of neurological symptoms, mood and behaviour problems.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe majority of patients experienced long-lasting symptoms 6 to 8 months after hospital discharge and almost half reported at least one long-standing symptom, with chronic fatigue and respiratory problems being the most frequent. A smaller number reported multisystem impacts with three or more long-standing categories present at follow-up. A higher risk was found for women, for chronic pulmonary disease with chronic fatigue, and neurological symptoms and mood and behaviour problems with asthma.

249,Harnessing recombinase polymerase amplification for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited settings,"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged testing capacity worldwide. The mass testing needed to stop the spread of the virus requires new molecular diagnostic tests that are faster and with reduced equipment requirement, but as sensitive as the current gold standard protocols based on polymerase chain reaction.

We developed a fast (25-35 minutes) molecular test using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification for simultaneous detection of two conserved regions of the virus, targeting the E and RdRP genes. The diagnostic platform offers two complementary detection methods: real-time fluorescence or visual dipstick.

The analytical sensitivity of the test by real-time fluorescence was 9.5 (95% CI: 7.0-18) RNA copies per reaction for the E gene and 17 (95% CI: 11-93) RNA copies per reaction for the RdRP gene. The analytical sensitivity for the dipstick readout was 130 (95% CI: 82-500) RNA copies per reaction. The assay showed high specificity with both detection methods when tested against common seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV model samples. The dipstick readout demonstrated potential for point-of-care testing, with simple or equipment-free incubation methods and a user-friendly prototype smartphone application was proposed with data capture and connectivity.

This ultrasensitive molecular test offers valuable advantages with a swift time-to-result and it requires minimal laboratory equipment compared to current gold standard assays.

250,Ultrasensitive assay for saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.,"Widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is highly valuable for identifying asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals to slow community disease transmission. However, there remains a technological gap for highly reliable, easy, and quick SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests that are suitable for frequent mass testing. Compared to the conventional nasopharyngeal (NP) swab-based tests, saliva-based methods are attractive due to easier and safer sampling protocols. Despite its merits in rapid turn-around-time and high throughput compared to traditional PCR-based technologies, the widespread use of saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests is hindered by limited analytical sensitivity of current methods. Here, we report the first ultrasensitive, saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with an analytical sensitivity of < 0.32 pg/ml, corresponding to 4 viral RNA copies/{micro}l, which is comparable to that of PCR-based tests. Using the novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based S-PLEX immunoassay, we measured the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen concentration in 105 saliva samples obtained from non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients. Our assay displayed absolute specificity and high sensitivity (90.2%), where it correctly identified samples with viral loads up to 35 CT cycles by saliva-based PCR. Paired NP swab-based PCR results were also obtained for 86 cases for comparison. Our assay showed high concordance with saliva-based and NP swab-based PCR in samples with negative (< 0.32 pg/ml) and strongly positive (> 2 pg/ml) N antigen concentrations. Our study unveiled the ultrasensitivity and specificity of the saliva-based S-PLEX assay, demonstrating its clinical value as a high throughput, complementary alternative to PCR-based techniques. The novel technique is especially valuable in cases where compliance to frequent swabbing may be problematic (e.g. schools, nursing homes, etc.).",Annie Ren; Dorsa Sohaei; Ioannis Zacharioudakis; George B Sigal; Martin Stengelin; Anu Matthew; Christopher Campbell; Nikhil Padmanabhan; Daniel Romero; Jessica Joe; Antoninus Soosaipillai; Vathany Kulasingam; Tony Mazzulli; Xinliu Angel Li; Allison McGeer; Eleftherios P.

251,"Clinical evaluation of the Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific quantitative IgG and IgM assays in infected, recovered, and vaccinated groups","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose a significant burden on global health infrastructure. While identification and containment of new cases remains important, laboratories must now pivot and consider assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naive, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and vaccinated (including both naive and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples recovered prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP titers, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naive group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than naive following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.",Madhusudhanan Narasimhan; Lenin Mahimainathan; Ellen Raj; Andrew E Clark; John Markantonis; Allen Green; Jing Xu; Jeffrey A SoRelle; Charles Alexis; Kimberly Fankhauser; Hiren Parikh; Kathleen Wilkinson; Annika Reczek; Nao Kopplin; Sruthi Yekkaluri; Jyoti Balani; Abey Thomas; Amit Singal; Ravi Sarode; Alagarraju Muthukumar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251940,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251940,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
252,Evaluation of sampling frequency and normalization of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations for capturing COVID-19 burdens in the community,"Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 provides an approach for assessing the infection burden across a city. For these data to be useful for public health, measurement variability and the relationship to case data need to be established. We measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in the influent of twelve wastewater treatment plants from August 2020 to January 2021. Replicate samples demonstrated that N1 gene target concentrations varied by {+/-}21% between technical replicate filters and by {+/-}14% between duplicate assays. COVID-19 cases were correlated significantly (rho[&ge;]0.70) to wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations for seven plants, including large and small cities. SARS-CoV-2 data normalized to flow improved correlations to reported COVID-19 cases for some plants, but normalizing to a spiked recovery control (BCoV) or a fecal marker (PMMoV or HF183) generally reduced correlations. High frequency sampling demonstrated that a minimum of two samples collected per week was needed to maintain accuracy in trend analysis. We found a significantly different ratio of COVID-19 cases to SARS-CoV-2 loads in one of three large communities, suggesting a higher rate of undiagnosed cases.

253,"Country differences in transmissibility, age distribution and case-fatality of SARS-CoV-2: a global ecological analysis","IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the world yet the first pandemic waves in many low-income countries appeared milder than initially forecasted through mathematical models. Hypotheses for this observed difference include under-ascertainment of cases and deaths, country population age structure, and immune modulation secondary to exposure to endemic parasitic infections. We conducted a country-level ecological study to describe patterns in key SARS-CoV-2 outcomes by country and region and to explore possible associations of the potential explanatory factors with these outcomes.

MethodsWe collected publicly available data at country level and compared them using standardisation techniques. We then explored the association between exposures and outcomes using alternative approaches: random forest (RF) regression and linear (LM) regression. We adjusted for potential confounders and plausible effect modifications.

ResultsAltogether, data on the mean time-varying reproduction number (mean Rt) were available for 153 countries, but standardised averages for the age of cases and deaths and for the case-fatality ratio (CFR) could only be computed for 61, 39 and 31 countries respectively. While mean Rt was highest in the WHO Europe and Americas regions, median age of death was lower in the Africa region even after standardisation, with broadly similar CFR. Population age was strongly associated with mean Rt and the age-standardised median age of observed cases and deaths in both RF and LM models. The models highlighted other plausible roles of population density, testing intensity and co-morbidity prevalence, but yielded uncertain results as regards exposure to common parasitic infections.

ConclusionsThe average age of a population seems to be an important country-level factor explaining both transmissibility and the median age of observed cases and deaths, even after age-standardisation. Potential associations between endemic infections and COVID-19 are worthy of further exploration but seem unlikely, from this analysis, to be key drivers of the variation in observed COVID-19 epidemic trends. Our study was limited by the availability of outcome data and its causally uncertain ecological design, with the observed distribution of age amongst reported cases and deaths suggesting key differences in surveillance and testing strategy and capacity by country and the representativeness of case reporting of infection.

ObjectiveTo identify the most important predictors of hospital discharge and mortality from measurements at admission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingElectronic records from hospitalized patients.

ParticipantsPatients admitted between March 3rd and August 24th with COVID-19 in Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals.

Exposures216 phenotypic variables collected within 48 hours of admission.

Main OutcomesWe used age-stratified (<60 and >=60 years) random survival forests with competing risks to identify the most important predictors of death and discharge. Fine-Gray competing risk regression (FGR) models were then constructed based on the most important RSF-derived covariates.

ResultsOf 2212 patients, 1913 were discharged (age 57{+/-}19, time-to-discharge 9{+/-}11 days) while 279 died (age 75{+/-}14, time to death 14{+/-}15 days). Patients >= 60 years were nearly 10 times as likely to die within 60 days of admission as those <60. As the pandemic evolved, the rate of hospital discharge increased in both older and younger patients. Incident death and hospital discharge were accurately predicted by measures of respiratory distress, inflammation, infection, renal function, red cell turn over and cardiac stress. FGR models for each of hospital discharge and mortality as outcomes based on these variables performed well in the older (AUC 0.80-0.85 at 60-days) and younger populations (AUC >0.90 at 60-days).

Conclusions and RelevanceWe identified markers collected within 2 days of admission that predict hospital discharge and mortality in COVID-19 patients and provide prediction models that may be used to guide patient care. Our proposed model suggests that hospital discharge and mortality can be forecasted with high accuracy based on 8-10 variables at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also point to several specific pathways that could be the focus of future investigations directed at reducing mortality and expediting hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients. Probability of hospital discharge increased over the course of the pandemic.

255,Convalescent plasma for preventing critical illness in COVID-19: A phase 2 trial and immune profile,"RationaleThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented event requiring rapid adaptation to changing clinical circumstances. Convalescent immune plasma (CIP) is a promising treatment that can be mobilized rapidly in a pandemic setting.

ObjectivesWe tested whether administration of SARS-CoV-2 CIP at hospital admission could reduce the rate of ICU transfer or 28 day mortality.

MethodsIn a single-arm phase II study, patients >18 years-old with respiratory symptoms documented with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to a non-ICU bed were administered two units of CIP within 72 hours of admission. Detection of respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction and circulating anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were measured before and at time points after CIP transfusion.

Measurements and Main ResultsTwenty-nine patients were transfused CIP and forty-eight contemporaneous controls were identified with comparable baseline characteristics. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-spike, anti-receptor-binding domain, and anti-nucleocapsid significantly increased from baseline to post-transfusion for all proteins tested. In patients transfused with CIP, the rate of ICU transfer was 13.8% compared to 27.1% for controls with a hazard ratio 0.506 (95% CI 0.165-1.554), and 28-day mortality was 6.9% compared to 10.4% for controls, hazard ratio 0.640 (95% CI 0.124-3.298).

ConclusionsTransfusion of high-titer CIP to patients early after admission with COVID-19 respiratory disease was associated with reduced ICU transfer and 28-day mortality but was not statistically significant.

256,Clinical performance of oral sponge sampling for detection by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe current standard for coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) diagnosis is reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of naso-pharyngeal swabs (NPS), Sampling with NPS is invasive and requires specialized and trained personnel, which limits rapid and repeated screening for the disease. A less invasive and possibly self-administered sampling method may increase the capacity for testing and be more effective in identifying, isolating, and filtering out currently infected persons.

MethodsOver a period of three months, we included volunteers presenting with recent symptoms suggestive of a SARS-CoV-2 infection at a free COVID-19 screening center in the city of Nice, France. NPS as well as nasal and oral sponges were collected in parallel and analyzed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsOne hundred and forty-seven subjects were included, of whom, 41.5% were diagnosed with COVID-19 using NPS RT-PCR. RT-PCR on nasal and oral sponges showed a sensitivity of 87 to 98% and 72 to 87%, respectively for diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic subjects, depending on the type of RT-PCR technique used. The specificity was 100% whatever the RT-PCR test. The viral load determined with the oral samples was significantly lower than with NPS.

ConclusionTaken together, these results demonstrated that the oral sponge sampling method can be standardized, is easy to use and cheap. The acceptability makes it a repeatable test, notably for elderly people or children. It may become a high-frequency - low analytical sensitive testing strategy.

257,COVID-19 associated autoimmunity is a feature of severe respiratory disease - a Bayesian analysis.,"BackgroundSerological and clinical features with similarities to systemic autoimmunity have been reported in severe COVID-19, but there is a lack of studies that include contemporaneous controls who do not have COVID-19.

MethodsObservational cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure. Patients were divided into COVID+ and COVID- based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or endotracheal aspirates. No COVID-19 specific interventions were given. The primary clinical outcome was death in the ICU within 3 months; secondary outcomes included in-hospital death and disease severity measures. Measurements including autoantibodies, were done longitudinally. ANOVA and Fishers exact test were used with =0.05, with a false discovery rate of q=0.05. Bayesian analysis was performed to provide credible estimates of the possible states of nature compatible with our results.

Results22 COVID+ and 20 COVID- patients were recruited, 69% males, median age 60.5 years. Overall, 64% had anti-nuclear antibodies, 38% had antigen-specific autoantibodies, 31% had myositis related autoantibodies, and 38% had high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies. There were no statistically significant differences between COVID+ and COVID- for any of the clinical or autoantibody parameters. A specific pattern of anti-nuclear antibodies was associated with worse clinical severity for both cohorts.

ConclusionsSevere COVID+ patients have similar humoral autoimmune features as comparably ill COVID- patients, suggesting that autoantibodies are a feature of critical illness regardless of COVID-19 status.

258,"The unexpected dynamics of COVID-19 in Manaus, Brazil: Herd immunity versus interventions","The arrival of SARS-COV-2 in late March 2020 in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, captured worldwide attention and concern. The rapid growth of the epidemic, a health system that had collapsed, and mass gravesites for coping with growing numbers of dead, were broadcast by the media around the world. Moreover, a majority of the local Amazonian indigenous communities were physically distant from appropriate medical services, to the point where warnings of genocide were issued. In a recent Science paper (December 2020), Buss et al. reported that some 76% of the residents of the city of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, had been infected by October 2020. This estimate of the COVID-19 attack rate was based on a seroprevalence analysis of blood donor data, which despite its shortcomings was thought to be a sufficiently reliable proxy of the larger population. An attack rate of this magnitude (76%) implied that herd immunity had already been reached and the community was relatively protected from further infection. Yet in December 2020, a harsh second wave of COVID-19 struck Manaus, and currently appears to be even larger than the first wave. Here we use mathematical modelling of mortality data in Manaus, and in various states of Brazil, to understand why a second wave appeared against all expectations.

259,"The epidemiological characteristics of the primary health care based COVID-19 swabbed persons in Qatar, March- October 2020","BackgroundIn March 2020, Qatar started reporting increased numbers of COVID-19 positive cases. National preventive measures were put in place and testing plan has been developed to respond to the pandemic with the primary health care as the main provider. The study aims to describe the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 at the primary health care level in Qatar and to examine the factors associated with the positivity rate.

MethodRetrospective data analysis for all the cases screened for COVID-19 at the primary health care level in Qatar between the 11th of March and 31st of October 2020. The study analyzed the demographic characteristics of the tested persons and non-communicable disease burden, positivity rate by month, nationality, and age-group, factors associated with the positivity rate.

ResultsBetween the 11th of March and the 31st of October 2020, 285,352 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2, with a median age (IQR) of 32 (22-43) years. 59.9% were from the Middle East and North Africa region and 29.6% originally from Asia. Overall, among them, 11.2% had diabetes mellitus and 11.4% had hypertension. The epidemiological curve showed a steep increase in positivity rate from March till June 2020 at the highest rate of 21.4% in June 2020. The highest positivity rate was observed among Asian males at 20.3%. The positivity rates were almost the same among the tested persons for SARS-CoV-2 in the main three age-groups (0-18, 19-39, 40-59) at 13%, 14.5%, and 14.0%, respectively. In a multi regression model, being a male was associated with a higher risk (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.18). Persons originally from Asia were at higher risk than those originally from the Middle East and North Africa (OR 1.5; 95% CI 147 to 1.54). COVID-19 infection was higher among those presenting with clinical symptoms than those asymptomatic (OR. 4.16; 95% CI 4.05 to 4.28).

ConclusionThe epidemic predominantly affected younger ages and males namely coming from Asia. At the primary health care level, COVID-19 infection rate was higher among those who presented with clinical symptoms. The scale-up of the testing at the primary health care level helped in detecting more cases and was reflected in a steady increase in the positivity rate to be flattened afterward.",Mohamed Ghaith Al-Kuwari; Mariam Ali Abdulmalik; Ahmad Haj Bakri; Mujeeb Chettiyam Kandy; Maha Youssef Abdulla; John Gibb,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251722,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251722,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
260,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in a University Community: A Longitudinal Study of the Impact of Student Return to Campus on Infection Risk Among Community Members,"Background Returning university students represent large-scale, transient demographic shifts and a potential source of transmission to adjacent communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a non-random cohort of residents living in Centre County prior to the Fall 2020 term at the Pennsylvania State University and following the conclusion of the Fall 2020 term. We also report the seroprevalence in a non-random cohort of students collected at the end of the Fall 2020 term. Findings Of 345 community participants, 19 (5.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at their first visit between 7 August and 2 October. Of 625 student participants who returned to campus for fall instruction, 195 (31.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between 26 October and 23 November. Twenty-eight (8.1%) community participants returned a positive IgG antibody result by 9 December. Only contact with known SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and attendance at small gatherings (20-50 individuals) were significant predictors of detecting IgG antibodies among returning students (aOR, 95% CI: 3.24, 2.14-4.91; 1.62, 1.08-2.44; respectively). Interpretation Despite high seroprevalence observed within the student population, seroprevalence in a longitudinal cohort of community residents was low and stable from before student arrival for the Fall 2020 term to after student departure. The study implies that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur in geographically coincident populations.

261,Changes in the rate of cardiometabolic and pulmonary events during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundThere has been extensive speculation about the relationship between COVID-19 and various cardiometabolic and pulmonary conditions. This a complex question: COVID-19 may cause a cardiometabolic or respiratory event; admission for a clinical event may result in hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection; both may contribute to a patient surpassing the threshold for presenting to services; and the presence of a pandemic may change whether patients present to services at all. To inform analysis of these questions, we set out to describe the overall rate of various key clinical events over time, and their relationship with COVID-19.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England, we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform containing data from approximately 40% of the population of England. We selected the whole adult population of 17m patients and within this identified two further mutually exclusive groups: patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the community; and patients hospitalised with COVID-19. We report counts of death, DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and diabetic ketoacidosis in each month between February 2019 and October 2020 within each of: the general population, community SARS-CoV-2 cases, and hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Outcome events were defined using hospitalisations, GP records and cause of death data.

ResultsFor all outcomes except death there was a lower count of events in April 2020 compared to April 2019. For most outcomes the minimum count of events was in April 2020, where the decrease compared to April 2019 in events ranged from 5.9% (PE) to 40.0% (heart failure). Despite hospitalised COVID-19 patients making up just 0.14% of the population in April 2020, these patients accounted for an extremely high proportion of cardiometabolic and respiratory events in that month (range of proportions 10.3% (DVT) to 33.5% (AKI)).

InterpretationWe observed a substantial drop in the incidence of cardiometabolic and pulmonary events in the non-COVID-19 general population, but high occurrence of COVID-19 among patients with these events. Shortcomings in routine NHS secondary care data, especially around the timing and order of events, make causal interpretations challenging. We caution that the intermediate findings reported here should be used to inform the design and interpretation of any studies using a general population comparator to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 and other clinical events.",Alex J Walker; John Tazare; George Hickman; Christopher T Rentsch; Elizabeth J Williamson; Krishnan Bhaskaran; David Evans; Kevin Wing; Rohini Mathur; Angel YS Wong; Anna Schultze; Sebastian CJ Bacon; Christopher Bates; Caroline E Morton; Helen J Curtis; Emily Nightingale; Helen I McDonald; Amir Mehrkar; Peter Inglesby; Brian MacKenna; Jonathan Cockburn; William J Hulme; Harriet Forbes; Caroline Minassian; Richard Croker; John Parry; Frank Hester; Sam Harper; Rosalind M Eggo; Stephen JW Evans; Liam Smeeth; Ian J Douglas; Laurie Tomlinson; Ben Goldacre,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251812,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251812,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
262,Service user experiences and views regarding telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a co-produced framework analysis,"BackgroundThe prominence of telemental health, including providing care by video call and telephone, has greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are clear variations in uptake and acceptability, and concerns that digital exclusion may exacerbate previous inequalities in accessing good quality care. Greater understanding is needed of how service users experience telemental health, and what determines whether they engage and find it acceptable.

MethodsWe conducted a collaborative framework analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with a sample of people already experiencing mental health problems prior to the pandemic. Data relevant to participants experiences and views regarding telemental health during the pandemic was identified and extracted. Data collection and analysis used a participatory, coproduction approach where lived experience researchers, clinical and academic researchers contributed to all stages of data collection, analysis and interpretation of findings.

FindingsParticipants experiences and preferences regarding telemental health care were dynamic and varied across time, settings, and individuals. Participants preferences were shaped by the reason for contacting providers, their relationship with the care provider, and both parties access or acceptability to use remote technology. While face-to-face care tended to be the preferred option, participants identified benefits of remote care including making care more accessible for some populations and improved efficiency for functional appointments such as prescription reviews. Participants highlighted important new challenges around safety and privacy in online settings, and gave examples of good remote care strategies, including scheduling regular phone calls and developing guidelines about how to access remote care tools.

DiscussionParticipants in our study and previous literature have highlighted advantages of telemental health care, as well as significant limitations which hinder mental health support and exacerbate inequalities in access to services. Some of these limitations are seen as potentially removable, for example through staff training or better digital access for staff or service users. Others indicate a need to maintain traditional face-to-face contact at least for some appointments. There is a clear need for care to be flexible and individualised to service user circumstances and preferences. Further research is needed on ways of minimising digital exclusion and to support staff in making effective and collaborative use of relevant technologies.",Norha Vera San Juan; Prisha Shah; Merle Schlief; Rebecca Appleton; Patrick Nyikavaranda; Mary Birken; Una Foye; Natasha Lyons; Luke Sheridan-Rains; Zainab Dedat; Brynmor Lloyd-Evans; Justin J Needle; Alan Simpson; Nicola Morant; Sonia Johnson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251978,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251978,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
263,Assessing Age-Specific Vaccination Strategies and Post-Vaccination Reopening Policies for COVID-19 Control Using SEIR Modeling Approach,"BackgroundAs the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, it is badly needed to develop vaccination guidelines to prioritize the vaccination delivery in order to effectively stop COVID-19 epidemic and minimize the loss.

MethodsWe evaluated the effect of age-specific vaccination strategies on the number of infections and deaths using an SEIR model, considering the age structure and social contact patterns for different age groups for each of different countries.

ResultsIn general, the vaccination priority should be given to those younger people who are active in social contacts to minimize the number of infections; while the vaccination priority should be given to the elderly to minimize the number of deaths. But this principle may not always apply when the interaction of age structure and age-specific social contact patterns is complicated. Partially reopening schools, workplaces or households, the vaccination priority may need to be adjusted accordingly.

ConclusionsPrematurely reopening social contacts could initiate a new outbreak or even a new pandemic out of control if the vaccination rate and the detection rate are not high enough. Our result suggests that it requires at least nine months of vaccination before fully reopening social contacts in order to avoid a new pandemic.",Xia Wang; Hulin Wu; Sanyi Tang Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251981,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251981,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True

In this context, lack of adequate knowledge and appropriate attitude among the CHW can directly influence the COVID-19 management programme. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 among the CHW of India known as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). A descriptive cross-sectional was conducted in the state of Tripura, Northeast India, among ASHAs with 14-, 4- and 3-item self-administered questionnaire for knowledge, attitude and practice. Around 61.2% of participants had the mean correct answer rate and the mean score of knowledge was 8.57{+/-} 2.25 ({+/-}SD). As per Blooms cut-off, it was observed that only 10% of the ASHAs had adequate knowledge, 30.9% showed positive attitude and 88% adhered to the good practices.

The paper provides data on the vaccine willingness in Australia as of January 2021 and how this changed since August 2020 both at the national level and for particular individuals. The paper provides estimates of how vaccine willingness has changed for different population sub-groups and the individual level characteristics which are associated with changes in vaccine willingness. We find an overall decrease in vaccine willingness, with the biggest decline being those who would definitely get a vaccine as of August 2020 but said they would only probably get a vaccine as of January 2021. We also look at the factors associated with vaccine willingness, as well as the factors associated with change through time.

Executive summaryO_LIThe paper provides data on the vaccine willingness in Australia as of January 2021 and how this changed since August 2020 both at the national level and for particular individuals.
C_LIO_LIThere has been a substantial increase in vaccine resistance and hesitancy and a large decline in vaccine likeliness between August 2020 and January 2021
O_LICombined, 21.7 per cent of Australians said they probably or definitely would not get a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021, a significant and substantial increase from the 12.7 per cent of Australians who gave the same responses in August 2020.
C_LI
C_LIO_LIAt the individual level, 31.9 per cent of Australians became less willing to get the vaccine between August 2020 and January 2021 in that they moved from a more to a less willing category.
O_LIThere were still some Australians who became more willing over the period to get vaccinated (9.9 per cent).
C_LI
C_LIO_LIThe largest single flow across willingness categories was the 18.7 per cent of Australians who went from being definitely willing to get a COVID-19 vaccination to only probably willing to get one. There was a large decline in vaccine certainty, alongside increases in vaccine resistance.
C_LIO_LIWe found three attitudinal factors that were particularly important in explaining the decline in willingness. Those Australians who think too much is being made of COVID-19, those who have low confidence in hospitals and the health care system, and those who are not optimistic about the next 12 months had all decreased in terms of their willingness to get vaccinated once a vaccine is available.
O_LIIn addition to campaigns targeting vaccination directly, those programs that improve confidence, remind people of the dangers of COVID-19, but importantly highlight the potential for a much better 2022 all have the potential to improve vaccination rates.
C_LI
C_LIO_LIFemales, Indigenous Australians, those who speak a language other than English at home and those who have not completed Year 12 have all became less willing to get a vaccine since August 2020 compared to the rest of the Australian population.
O_LIThese population groups are arguably the most urgent focus of any public health campaigns to improve willingness, both because they have low willingness to start with, but also because there is the potential opportunity to bring their willingness back to what it was in August 2020 when there was a smaller gap with the rest of the Australian population.
C_LIO_LIThere is a real need to consider a significantly enhanced public health campaign in languages other than English
C_LIO_LIThere is a need to convey information to the general public in a way that is informative, reassuring and salient for those without a degree

Undetected bias induced by inappropriate use of datasets, and improper consideration of confounders prevents the translation of prediction models into clinical practice. This study provides a systematic evaluation of publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets, determining their potential use and evaluating potential sources of bias.

Only 5 out of 256 identified datasets met at least the criteria for proper assessment of risk of bias and could be analysed in detail. Remarkably almost all of the datasets utilised in 78 papers published in peer-reviewed journals, are not among these 5 datasets, thus leading to models with high risk of bias. This raises concerns about the suitability of such models for clinical use.

267,"SARS-CoV-2 Shedding Dynamics Across the Respiratory Tract, Sex, and Disease Severity for Adult and Pediatric COVID-19","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo analyze SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics across COVID-19 severity, the respiratory tract, sex and age cohorts (aged 0 to 17 years, 18 to 59 years, and 60 years or older).

DesignSystematic review and pooled analyses.

SettingMEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science Core Collection, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched up to 20 November 2020.

ParticipantsThe systematic dataset included 1,266 adults and 136 children with COVID-19.

MeasurementsCase characteristics (COVID-19 severity, age and sex) and quantitative respiratory viral loads (rVLs).

ResultsIn the URT, adults with severe COVID-19 had higher rVLs at 1 DFSO than adults (P = 0.005) or children (P = 0.017) with nonsevere illness. Between 1-10 DFSO, severe adults had comparable rates of SARS-CoV-2 clearance from the URT as nonsevere adults (P = 0.479) and nonsevere children (P = 0.863). In the LRT, severe adults showed higher post-symptom-onset rVLs than nonsevere adults (P = 0.006). In the analyzed period (4-10 DFSO), severely affected adults had no significant trend in SARS-CoV-2 clearance from LRT (P = 0.105), whereas nonsevere adults showed a clear trend (P < 0.001). After stratifying for disease severity, sex and age (including child vs. adult) were not predictive of the duration of respiratory shedding.

LimitationLimited data on case comorbidities and few samples in some cohorts.

ConclusionHigh, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2 characterized severe COVID-19 in adults. After symptom onset, severe cases tended to have higher URT shedding than their nonsevere counterparts. Disease severity, rather than age or sex, predicted SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. LRT specimens should more accurately prognosticate COVID-19 severity than URT specimens.

268,Diagnostic Performance of Pooled RT-PCR Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"BackgroundWith the high number of COVID-19 cases, a need to optimize testing strategy must be regarded to obtain timely diagnosis for early containment measures. With this, several studies have employed pooled RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 as this could potentially conserve laboratory resources while has the capacity to test several individuals. However, this was recommended to firstly validate the method as different laboratory reagents and equipment vary with its diagnostic performance.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of pooled SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabbed samples using RT-PCR technique.

MethodsA records review of two-staged pooled RT-PCR testing data from August 10, 26, 30 and September 5, 2020 was utilized from Northern Mindanao Medical Center COVID-19 Satellite Laboratory (formerly CHDNM TB Regional Center). For the first stage, using known samples, a total of 30 pools were made for each of the pooling size, 5- and 10-pooled, on both pooling phase, pre- and post-RNA extraction. One positive individual was used to represent each of the Cycle threshold values given (<24, 25-28, 29-32, 33-36, and 37-40) while the rest of the samples were negative. For the second stage, 54 pools of five from 270 random unknown samples were used to validate the results. Target gene performance of N gene and RdRp was also determined.

Key ResultsResults show that 5-pooled sample has higher sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 88.97-100), 66.95% (95% CI, 60.75-72.6), 28.18% (95% CI, 20.62-37.22), and 100% (95% CI, 97.66-100) compared to 10-pooled sample that has 87.1% (95% CI, 71.15-94.87), 56.9% (50.57-63.02), 20.77% (95% CI, 14.68-28.53) and 97.14% (95% CI, 92.88-98.88). Further, these Ct values were only from the N gene, emphasizing its higher diagnostic performance as well to detect SARS-CoV-2 compared to RdRp as only a few samples were detected, thus, no analysis was made.

ConclusionThis study found out that 5-pooled sample has better diagnostic performance compared to 10-pooled samples. Specifically, all positive individual samples were detected in 5-pooled samples in pre-RNA extraction phase which these results are evident and consistent on both known and unknown samples. N gene was found out to detect more SARS-CoV-2 samples compared to RdRp.",Diadem Ricarte; Aubrey Gador; Leomill Mendiola; Ian Christian Gonzales,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251961,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251961,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
269,Estimating the Failure Risk of Hotel-based Quarantine for Preventing COVID-19 Outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand,"AimWith increasing global use of hotel-based quarantine as part of COVID-19 border control efforts, we aimed to assess its risk of failure.

MethodsWe searched official websites in both Australia and New Zealand (NZ) to identify outbreaks and border control failures associated with hotel quarantine (searches conducted up to 12 February 2021). We used two denominators: a) the estimated number of travelers who went through these facilities during the 2020 year up to 31 January 2021; and b) the equivalent number of SARS-CoV-2 positive people who went through these facilities.

ResultsUp to 31 January 2021, Australia had seven failures with one causing over 800 deaths and six resulting in lockdowns. In NZ there were nine failures, with one causing an outbreak with three deaths, and also a lockdown. The overall failure risk for those transiting quarantine was estimated at one failure per 20,702 travelers and one failure per 252 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (both countries combined). At the country level, there were 15.5 failures per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases transiting quarantine in NZ (95%CI: 5.4 to 25.7), compared to 2.0 per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Australia (0.5 to 3.5) - a greater than seven-fold difference in risk. Approaches to infection control and surveillance in hotel quarantine were found to vary widely by country and by state/territory.

ConclusionsThere appears to be a notable risk of failure with the use of hotel quarantine in these two countries. The large variation in infection control practices suggests opportunity for risk reduction.",Leah M Grout; Ameera Katar; Driss Ait Ouakrim; Jennifer A Summers; Amanda Kvalsvig; Michael G Baker; Tony Blakely; Nick Wilson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251946,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251946,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
270,Clinical validation of the quantitative Siemens SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG assay (sCOVG) reveals improved sensitivity and a good correlation with virus neutralization titers,"ObjectivesSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and induce a specific antibody response. Serological assays detecting IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein are useful to monitor the immune response after infection or vaccination. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay.

MethodsSensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients.

ResultsSpecificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/ml; intensive care: 59.5 U/ml) than in outpatients (3.8 U/ml; p<0.0001).

ConclusionsPerformance characteristics of the sCOVG assay have been improved compared to the predecessor test COV2G. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD IgG levels could be used as a surrogate for virus neutralization capacity.

271,Early pandemic molecular diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in children,"BackgroundIn the US, community circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely began in February 2020 after mostly travel-related cases. Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia began testing on 3/9/2020 for pediatric and adult patients, and for all admitted patients on 4/1/2020, allowing an early glimpse into the local molecular epidemiology of the virus.

MethodsWe obtained 169 SARS-CoV-2 samples (83 from patients <21 years old) from March through May and produced whole genome sequences. We used genotyping tools to track variants over time and to test for possible genotype associated clinical presentations and outcomes in children.

ResultsOur analysis uncovered 13 major lineages that changed in relative abundance as cases peaked in mid-April in Philadelphia. We detected at least 6 introductions of distinct viral variants into the population. As a group, children had more diverse virus genotypes than the adults tested. No strong differences in clinical variables were associated with genotypes.

ConclusionsWhole genome analysis revealed unexpected diversity, and distinct circulating viral variants within the initial peak of cases in Philadelphia. Most introductions appeared to be local from nearby states. Although limited by sample size, we found no evidence that different genotypes had different clinical impacts in children in this study.

SummaryUsing sequencing and a novel technique for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 diversity, we investigated 169 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (83 <21 years old).

273,Mobility and COVID-19 in Andorra: Country-scale analysis of high-resolution mobility patterns and infection spread,"In the absence of effective vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mobility restrictions, were globally adopted as critically important strategies for curbing the spread of COVID-19. However, such interventions come with immense social and economic costs and the relative effectiveness of different mobility restrictions are not well understood. This study analyzed uniquely comprehensive datasets for the entirety of a small country, consisting of serology data, telecoms data, and COVID-19 case reports, in order to examine the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID-19. Andorra is a small European country where tourism is a large part of the economy. Stringent mobility restrictions were put in place in Spring 2020. Additionally, 91% of the population participated in a voluntary COVID-19 serology testing programme and those data were made available for this study. Furthermore, high resolution telecoms data for the entire population were available for analysis of mobility and proximity patterns. A set of mobility metrics were developed to indicate levels of crowding, stay-at-home rates, trip-making and contact with tourists. Mobility metrics were compared to infection rates across communities and transmission rate over time. Several of these metrics were highly correlated with transmission rate, with a lead time of approximately 18 days, with some metrics more highly correlated than others. There was a stronger correlation for measures of crowding and inter-community trip-making, and a weaker correlation for total trips (including intra-community trips) and stay-at-homes rates.",Ronan M Doorley; Alex Berke; Ariel Noyman; Luis Alberto Alonso; Josep Ribo; Vanesa Arroyo; Marc Pons; Kent Larson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251977,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251977,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
274,Decreased neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 global variants by therapeutic anti-spike protein monoclonal antibodies,"Monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, notably, those developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly and Company have proven to provide protection against severe COVID-19. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with heavily mutated spike proteins raises the concern that the therapy could become less effective if any of the mutations disrupt epitopes engaged by the antibodies. In this study, we tested monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 that are used in combination, for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, mink cluster 5 and COH.20G/677H. We report that REGN10987 maintains most of its neutralization activity against viruses with B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and mink cluster 5 spike proteins but that REGN10933 has lost activity against B.1.351 and mink cluster 5. The failure of REGN10933 to neutralize B.1.351 is caused by the K417N and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain; the failure to neutralize the mink cluster 5 spike protein is caused by the Y453F mutation. The REGN10933 and REGN10987 combination was 9.1-fold less potent on B.1.351 and 16.2-fold less potent on mink cluster 5, raising concerns of reduced efficacy in the treatment of patients infected with variant viruses. The results suggest that there is a need to develop additional monoclonal antibodies that are not affected by the current spike protein mutations.",Takuya Tada; Belinda M Dcosta; Hao Zhou; Ada Vaill; Wes Kazmierski; Nathaniel R Landau,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431897,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431897,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,False
275,Predicting the zoonotic capacity of mammal species for SARS-CoV-2,"Spillback transmission from humans to animals, and secondary spillover from animal hosts back into humans, have now been documented for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to threatening animal health, virus variants arising from novel animal hosts have the potential to undermine global COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Numerous studies have therefore investigated the zoonotic capacity of various animal species for SARS-CoV-2, including predicting both species susceptibility to infection and their capacities for onward transmission. A major bottleneck to these studies is the limited number of sequences for ACE2, a key cellular receptor in chordates that is required for viral cell entry. Here, we combined protein structure modeling with machine learning of species traits to predict zoonotic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 across 5,400 mammals. High accuracy model predictions were strongly corroborated by in vivo empirical studies, and identify numerous mammal species across global COVID-19 hotspots that should be prioritized for surveillance and experimental validation.",Ilya R Fischhoff; Adrian A.

276,Chyawanprash for the prevention of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are at high risk of exposure, the standard of care is personal protection from getting infected. Whether Ayurvedic rasayana drug like Chyawanprash can prevent symptomatic infection in frontline health care workers is unknown.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of the combination of Chyawanprash and Standard Preventive Regimen compared to the use of Standard Preventive Regimen alone on the proportion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs).

MethodsAn open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in the HCWs between 25 to 60 years age currently working in an environment with chance of direct exposure to COVID-19 cases. The interventions to be compared in this trial were Standard Preventive Regimen as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles (Group I) and Ayurvedic Intervention viz., Chyawanprash 12 g twice for 30 days from day of randomization plus Standard Preventive Regimen (Group II). The incidence of RT PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases in both groups, was the primary outcome measure. Evaluation of the safety of the study drug (by any statistically significant change in various biochemical and hematological parameters and occurrence of any adverse drug reactions); incidence of any other infective diseases (bacterial /viral/ fungal / etc.) like upper respiratory tract illness during the study period and any change in the immunoglobulins like IgG, IgM and IgE and inflammatory markers like TNF alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 were the secondary outcome measures.

ResultsOut of 193 participants who completed the study, no participant in both groups was COVID-19 positive at the end of one month. In post intervention follow-up, 4 subjects in Group I and 2 subjects in Group II were COVID-19 positive. No adverse drug reaction or any serious adverse event was reported during the study. No clinically significant change in the safety parameters was observed before and after the study. Statistically significant rise in Serum IgG level was seen in Group II but other inflammatory and immune markers did not show statistically significant difference.

ConclusionChyawanprash was well tolerated by all the participants in the intervention group but to prove its adaptogenic effect and efficacy as an add-on to the standard care in preventing the occurrence of COVID-19, clinical trial for longer duration with larger sample size is needed.

277,Antiviral activity of influenza A virus defective interfering particles against SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro through stimulation of innate immunity,"SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 only show limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with produced, cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. These results suggest an unspecific stimulation of the innate immunity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.",Ulfert Rand; Sascha Young Kupke; Hanna Shkarlet; Marc Dominique Hein; Tatjana Hirsch; Pavel Marichal-Gallardo; Luka Cicin-Sain; Udo Reichl; Dunja Bruder,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.431972,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.431972,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,False
278,SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution in the United States: High accumulation of viral mutations over time likely through serial Founder Events and mutational bursts.,"Since the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and within a year has caused 2.29 million deaths globally. With dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, the end of the year data revealed the presence of known variants of concern including B.1.1.7, which has acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral sequences are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may be become problematic when superspreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThe pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the death of more than 2.29 million people and continues to be a severe threat internationally. Although simple measures such as social distancing, periodic lockdowns and hygiene protocols were immediately put into force, the infection rates were only temporarily minimized. When infection rates exploded again new variants of the virus began to emerge. Our study focuses on a representative set of sequences from the United States throughout 2020 and early 2021. We show that the driving force behind the variants of public health concern, is widespread infection and superspreader events. In particular, we show accumulation of mutations over time with little loss from genetic drift, including in the Spike region, which could be problematic for vaccines and therapies. This lurking accumulated genetic variation may be a superspreader event from becoming more common and lead to variants that can escape the immune protection provided by the existing vaccines.",Rafail Nikolaos Tasakis; Georgios Samaras; Anna Jamison; Michelle Lee; Alexandra Paulus; Gabrielle Whitehouse; Laurent Verkoczy; F.

Although several vaccines have recently reached the market, the development of specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is an important additional strategy in fighting the pandemic. One of the most promising pharmacological targets is the viral main protease (Mpro). Here, we present an optimized biochemical assay procedure for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We have comprehensively investigated the influence of different buffer components and conditions on the assay performance, and characterized six FRET substrates with a 2-Abz/Tyr(3-NO2) FRET pair. The substrates 2-AbzSAVLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH, a truncated version of the established DABCYL/EDANS FRET substrate, and a new substrate 2-AbzVVTLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH are promising candidates for screening and inhibitor characterization.

281,Evaluation of a fully automated high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex qPCR assay with build-in screening functionality for DelHV69/70- and N501Y variants such as B.1.1.7,"1BackgroundNew SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility, like B.1.1.7 from England or B1.351 from South Africa, have caused considerable concern worldwide. In order to contain the spread of these lineages, it is of utmost importance to have rapid, sensitive and high-throughput detection methods at hand.

MethodsAnalytical sensitivity was assessed for both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 lineage by serial dilution. A total of 141 clinical samples were subjected to the test and results compared to a commercial manual typing-PCR assay and NGS.

ResultsThe multiplex assay is highly sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, with an LoD of 25.82 cp/ml (CI: 11.61 - 57.48). LoDs are slightly higher for the HV68/70 deletion (111.36 cp/ml; CI: 78.16 - 158.67) and the N501Y SNP (2548.04 cp/ml, CI: 1592.58 - 4076.73). A total of 141 clinical samples were tested with the assay, including 16 samples containing SARS-CoV-2 of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Three non-B.1.1.7 samples contained a HV69/70 deletion. All were correctly identified by the multiplex assay.

ConclusionWe describe here a highly sensitive, fully automated multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of del-HV69/70 and N501Y that can distinguish between lineages B.1.1.7 and B1.351.

The generated surveillance sequencing data (n = 320 SARS-CoV-2 genomes) showed that the development of the local viral population structure from August to December 2020 was consistent with European trends, with the notable absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants 20I/501Y.V1/B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 until the end of the local sampling period. Against a background of local surveillance and other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 data, four putative SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at Dusseldorf University Hospital between October and December 2020 (n = 44 viral genomes) were investigated and confirmed as clonal, contributing to the development of improved infection control and prevention measures. An analysis of the generated surveillance sequencing data with respect to infection clusters in the population based on a greedy clustering algorithm identified five candidate clusters, all of which were subsequently confirmed by the integration of public health authority contact tracing data and shown to be represent transmission settings of particular relevance (schools, care homes). A joint analysis of outbreak and surveillance data identified a potential transmission of an outbreak strain from the local population into the hospital and back; and an in-depth analysis of one population infection cluster combining genetic with contact tracing data enabled the identification of a previously unrecognized population transmission chain involving a martial arts gym. Based on these results and a real-time sequencing experiment in which we demonstrated the feasibility of achieving sample-to-turnaround times of <30 hours with the Oxford Nanopore technology, we discuss the potential benefits of routine ultra-fast sequencing of all detected infections for contact tracing, infection cluster detection, and, ultimately, improved management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Andreas Walker; Torsten Houwaart; Patrick Finzer; Lutz Ehlkes; Alona Tyshaieva; Maximilian Damagnez; Daniel Strelow; Ashley Duplessis; Jessica Nicolai; Tobias Wienemann; Teresa Tamayo; Malte Kohns Vasconcelos; Lisanna Hülse; Katrin Hoffmann; Nadine Lübke; Sandra Hauka; Marcel Andree; Martin P Däumer; Alexander Thielen; Susanne Kolbe-Busch; Klaus Göbels; Rainer Zotz; Klaus Pfeffer; Jörg Timm; Alexander T Dilthey; - German COVID-19 OMICS Initiative (DeCOI),https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251678,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251678,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
283,Optimal Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccines in the Philippines,"Vaccine allocation is a national concern especially for countries such as the Philippines that have limited resources in acquiring COVID-19 vaccines. As such, certain groups are suggested to be prioritized for vaccination to protect the most vulnerable before vaccinating others. Our model suggests an allocation of vaccines such that COVID-19 deaths are minimized while the prioritization framework is satisfied. Results of the model show that a vaccine coverage of at least 50 to 70% of the population can be enough for a community with limited supplies, and an increase in vaccine supply is beneficial if initial coverage is less than the specified target range. Also, among the vaccines considered in the study, the one with 89.9% effectiveness and has a 183 Philippine peso (Php) price per dose projected the least number of deaths. Compared to other model variations and common allocation approaches, the model has achieved both an optimal and equitable allocation.

284,"A disproportionate epidemic: COVID-19 cases and deaths among essential workers in Toronto, Canada","Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of non-essential businesses have been central to COVID-19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases (N=74,477) and deaths (N=2319), and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths. Taken together, results signal the need for active intervention strategies to complement restrictive measures to optimize both the equity and effectiveness of COVID-19 responses.",Amrita Rao; Huiting Ma; Gary Moloney; Jeff Kwong; Peter Juni; Beate Sander; Rafal Kustra; Stefan D Baral; Sharmistha Mishra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251572,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
285,COVID-19 Associated Stroke--A Single Centre Experience,"Background and PurposeVarious neurological complications have been reported in association with COVID-19. We report our experience of COVID-19 with stroke at a single center over a period of eight months spanning 1 March to 31 October 2020.

MethodsWe recruited all patients admitted to Internal Medicine with an acute stroke, who also tested positive for COVID-19 on RTPCR. We included all stroke cases in our analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality, and separately analyzed arterial infarcts for vascular territory of ischemic strokes.

ResultsThere were 62 stroke cases among 3923 COVID-19 admissions (incidence 1.6%). Data was available for 58 patients {mean age 52.6 years; age range 17-91; F/M=20/38; 24% (14/58) aged [&le;]40; 51% (30/58) hypertensive; 36% (21/58) diabetic; 41% (24/58) with O2 saturation <95% at admission; 32/58 (55.17 %) in-hospital mortality}. Among 58 strokes, there were 44 arterial infarcts, seven bleeds, three arterial infarcts with associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two combined infarct and bleed, and two of indeterminate type. Among the total 49 infarcts, Carotid territory was the commonest affected (36/49; 73.5%), followed by vertebrobasilar (7/49; 14.3%) and both (6/49; 12.2%). Concordant arterial block was seen in 61% (19 of 31 infarcts with angiography done).  Early stroke (within 48 hours of respiratory symptoms) was seen in 82.7% (48/58) patients. Patients with poor saturation at admission were older (58 vs 49 years) and had more comorbidities and higher mortality (79% vs 38%). Mortality was similar in young strokes and older patients, although the latter required more intense respiratory support. Logistic regression analysis showed that low GCS and requirement for increasing intensity of respiratory support predicted in-hospital mortality.

ConclusionsWe had a 1.6% incidence of COVID-19 related stroke of which the majority were carotid territory infarcts.

286,Excess Mortality in Suicide caused by COVID-19 in Japan,"BackgroundCountermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdown and voluntary restrictions against going out adversely affect human stress and economic activity. Particularly, this stress might lead to suicide.

ObjectWe examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19.

MethodWe applied the NIID model to suicide deaths from October 2009 through September, 2020 for the whole of Japan for both genders. Effects of the great earthquake that struck in eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 were incorporated into the estimation model.

ResultsSignificant excess mortality in suicide was found in July, August and September in 2020 for both genders. It was greater among females than among males. In total, 810 excess cases of mortality were identified.

Discussion and ConclusionExcess mortality during the two months was 1.4 times greater than the number of COVID-19 deaths confirmed by PCR testing.

We train and validate the model using data from a UK teaching hospital, adopting a landmarking approach that accounts for competing risks and informative missingness. Internal validation of the model on the first wave of patients presenting between March 1 and September 12, 2020 achieves an AUROC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93). Temporal validation on patients presenting between September 13, 2020 and January 1, 2021 gives an AUROC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.95).

288,"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey Among District Residents Presenting for Serologic Testing at Three Community Based Test Sites in Washington, DC, July to August, 2020","BackgroundThe District of Columbia (DC), a major metropolitan area, continues to see community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While serologic testing does not indicate current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it can indicate prior infection and help inform local policy and health guidance. The DC Department of Health (DC Health) conducted a community-based survey to estimate DCs SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and identify seropositivity-associated factors.

MethodsA mixed-methods cross-sectional serology survey was conducted among a convenience sample of DC residents during July 27-August 21, 2020. Free serology testing was offered at three public test sites. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire on household and demographic characteristics, COVID-like illness (CLI) since January 1, 2020, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 exposures. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to describe the sample population and assess factors associated with seropositivity.

ResultsAmong a sample of 671 participants, 51 individuals were seropositive, yielding an estimated seroprevalence of 7.6%. More than half (56.9%) of the seropositive participants reported no prior CLI; nearly half (47.1%) had no prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. Race/ethnicity, prior SARS-CoV-2 testing, prior CLI, employment status, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were associated with seropositivity (P<0.05). Among those reporting prior CLI, loss of taste or smell, duration of CLI, fewer days between CLI and serology test, or prior viral test were associated with seropositivity (P[&le;]0.006).

ConclusionsThese findings indicate many seropositive individuals reported no symptoms consistent with CLI since January or any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. This underscores the potential for cases to go undetected in the community and suggests wider-spread transmission than previously reported in DC.

What is already known on this subject?Traditional case-based detection and syndromic surveillance efforts might not identify mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. This is particularly true among people in the general population who do not have increased risk of severe illness or might not be tested otherwise. Consequently, the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infections might not be known.

What this study adds?A community-based seroprevalence survey conducted in Washington, DC, during July 27-August 21, 2020 estimated that 7.6% of the convenience sample had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating prior infection. At the time of this survey, most of the participants reported that they had not been previously infected with or tested for SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight both the value of serologic surveillance in complementing other surveillance methods, and the importance of continued prevention and mitigation measures, such as maintaining physical distances of at least 6 feet, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, practicing frequent hand hygiene, and wearing face masks properly and consistently around people who do not live with you.",Adrienne Sherman; Jacqueline Reuben; Naomi S David; Delores P Quasie-Woods; Jayleen K.

289,Mapping of SARS-CoV-2 Brain Invasion and Histopathology in COVID-19 Disease,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) causes acute respiratory distress, termed COVID-19 disease, with substantial morbidity and mortality. As SCV2 is related to previously-studied coronaviruses that have been shown to have the capability for brain invasion, it seems likely that SCV2 may be able to do so as well. To date, although there have been many clinical and autopsy-based reports that describe a broad range of SCV2-associated neurological conditions, it is unclear what fraction of these have been due to direct CNS invasion versus indirect effects caused by systemic reactions to critical illness. Still critically lacking is a comprehensive tissue-based survey of the CNS presence and specific neuropathology of SCV2 in humans. We conducted an extensive neuroanatomical survey of RT-PCR-detected SCV2 in 16 brain regions from 20 subjects who died of COVID-19 disease. Targeted areas were those with cranial nerve nuclei, including the olfactory bulb, medullary dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the pontine trigeminal nerve nuclei, as well as areas possibly exposed to hematogenous entry, including the choroid plexus, leptomeninges, median eminence of the hypothalamus and area postrema of the medulla. Subjects ranged in age from 38 to 97 (mean 77) with 9 females and 11 males. Most subjects had typical age-related neuropathological findings. Two subjects had severe neuropathology, one with a large acute cerebral infarction and one with hemorrhagic encephalitis, that was unequivocally related to their COVID-19 disease while most of the 18 other subjects had non-specific histopathology including focal {beta}-amyloid precursor protein white matter immunoreactivity and sparse perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing. Four subjects (20%) had SCV2 RNA in one or more brain regions including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, entorhinal area, temporal and frontal neocortex, dorsal medulla and leptomeninges. The subject with encephalitis was SCV2-positive in a histopathologically-affected area, the entorhinal cortex, while the subject with the large acute cerebral infarct was SCV2-negative in all brain regions. Like other human coronaviruses, SCV2 can inflict acute neuropathology in susceptible patients. Much remains to be understood, including what viral and host factors influence SCV2 brain invasion and whether it is cleared from the brain subsequent to the acute illness.",Geidy E Serrano; Jessica E.

Our retrospective analysis contrasts 31,069 individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who are propensity-matched based on demographics, location (zip code), and number of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and were at risk for infection at least 36 days after their first dose. Administration of two COVID-19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. Furthermore, vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than propensity-matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk: 0.4; p-value: 0.007).

291,Circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity,"Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS-CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild-type pseudovirus, 5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.",Wilfredo F.

We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current evidence on AI applications for COVID-19 in intensive care and emergency settings, focusing on methods, reporting standards, and clinical utility.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases from inception to 1 October 2020, without language restrictions. We included peer-reviewed original studies that applied AI for COVID-19 patients, healthcare workers, or health systems in intensive care, emergency or prehospital settings. We assessed predictive modelling studies using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) and a modified TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) statement for AI. We critically appraised the methodology and key findings of all other studies.

ResultsOf fourteen eligible studies, eleven developed prognostic or diagnostic AI predictive models, all of which were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Common pitfalls included inadequate sample sizes, poor handling of missing data, failure to account for censored participants, and weak validation of models. Studies had low adherence to reporting guidelines, with particularly poor reporting on model calibration and blinding of outcome and predictor assessment. Of the remaining three studies, two evaluated the prognostic utility of deep learning-based lung segmentation software and one studied an AI-based system for resource optimisation in the ICU. These studies had similar issues in methodology, validation, and reporting.

293,Quantification of the tradeoff between test sensitivity and test frequency in COVID-19 epidemic - a multi-scale modeling approach,"Control strategies that employ real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic are inefficient in fighting the epidemic due to high cost, delays in obtaining results, and the need of specialized personnel and equipment for laboratory processing. Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 57% to as low as 1.5% half a year into the outbreak and to 3.2% three years into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.",Jonathan E Forde; Stanca M.

Here, we studied nasal and systemic immune parameters in comprehensively characterised patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and healthy community controls. PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants were more likely to receive dexamethasone and a beta-lactam antibiotic, and more likely to survive to hospital discharge than PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-/IgG- participants. PCR-/IgG+ participants exhibited a nasal and systemic cytokine signature analogous to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants, but had an increased propensity for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation. The nasal immune signature in PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants was distinct and predominated by chemokines and neutrophils.

AimThis study aims to estimate the risk of exposure for COVID-19 across Primary Healthcare workers in the State of Qatar. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted to study the burden of COVID-19 among staff working at PHCC during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1 to October 31, 2020.

Results1,048 (87.4%)of the infected HCWs belonged to the age group below 45 years, and 488 (40.7%) HCWs were females. 450 (37.5%) were HCWs clinical staff working in one of the 27 PHCC HCs; Despite the increased patient footfall and risk environment, the COVID HCs had an attack rate of 10.1%, which is not significantly different from the average attack rate of 8.9% among staff located in other HCs (p-value =0.26). Storekeepers, engineering & maintenance staff, housekeeping staff, support staff, and security staff (outsourced positions) had the highest positivity rates, 100%, 67.2%, 47.1%, 32.4%, and 29.5% respective positivity rates.

296,Immune characterization and profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing mortality rates of COVID-19 create an urgent need for treatments, which are currently lacking. Although vaccines have been approved by the FDA for emergency use in the U.S., patients will continue to require pharmacologic intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality as vaccine availability remains limited. The rise of new variants makes the development of therapeutic strategies even more crucial to combat the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Evidence from several studies suggests the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Consequently, host immune factors are becoming more recognized as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. To develop therapeutic strategies to combat current and future coronavirus outbreaks, understanding how the coronavirus hijacks the host immune system during and after the infection is crucial. In this study, we investigated immunological patterns or characteristics of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed large bulk RNASeq and single cell RNAseq data from COVID-19 patient samples to immunoprofile differentially expressed gene sets and analyzed pathways to identify human host protein targets. We observed an immunological profile of severe COVID-19 patients characterized by upregulated cytokines, interferon-induced proteins, and pronounced T cell lymphopenia, supporting findings by previous studies. We identified a number of host immune targets including PERK, PKR, TNF, NF-kB, and other key genes that modulate the significant pathways and genes identified in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified genes modulated by COVID-19 infection that are implicated in oncogenesis, including E2F7 and RB1, suggesting a mechanism by which cancer may arise in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Further clinical investigation of these targets may lead to bonafide therapeutic strategies to treat the current COVID-19 pandemic and protect against future outbreaks and viral escape variants.",Martine Policard; Sidharth Jain; Samantha Rego; Sivanesan Dakshanamurthy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431721,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431721,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
297,Alzheimer's-like remodeling of neuronal ryanodine receptor in COVID-19,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 involves multiple organs including cardiovascular, pulmonary and central nervous system. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection afflicts diverse organ systems remains challenging1,2. Particularly vexing has been the problem posed by persistent organ dysfunction known as ""long COVID,"" which includes cognitive impairment3. Here we provide evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to activation of TGF-{beta} signaling and oxidative overload. One consequence is oxidation of the ryanodine receptor/calcium (Ca2+) release channels (RyR) on the endo/sarcoplasmic (ER/SR) reticuli in heart, lung and brains of patients who succumbed to COVID-19. This depletes the channels of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 causing them to leak Ca2+ which can promote heart failure4,5, pulmonary insufficiency 6 and cognitive and behavioral defects7-9. Ex-vivo treatment of heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID-19 patients using a Rycal drug (ARM210)10 prevented calstabin2 loss and fixed the channel leak. Of particular interest is that neuropathological pathways activated downstream of leaky RyR2 channels in Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients were activated in COVID-19 patients. Thus, leaky RyR2 Ca2+ channels may play a role in COVID-19 pathophysiology and could be a therapeutic target for amelioration of some comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Andrew R Marks; Haikel Dridi; Steven Reiken; Xiaoping Liu; Leah Sittenfeld,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431811,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431811,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
298,A Combination Adjuvant for the Induction of Potent Antiviral Immune Responses for a Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Protein Vaccine,"Several promising vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have received emergency use authorization in various countries and are being administered to the general population. However, many issues associated with the vaccines and the protection they provide remain unresolved, including the duration of conferred immunity, whether or not sterilizing immunity is imparted, and the degree of cross-variant protection that is achieved with these vaccines. Early evidence has suggested potentially reduced vaccine efficacy towards certain viral variants in circulation. Development of adjuvants compatible with these vaccine platforms that enhance the immune response and guide the adaptive and cellular immune responses towards the types of responses most effective for broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 will likely be pivotal for complete protection. Natural viral infection stimulates strong immune responses through the activation of three main pathways involving Toll-, RIG-I-, and NOD-like receptors (TLRs, RLRs, NLRs). As induction of appropriate innate responses is crucial for long-lasting adaptive immunity and for shaping the correct types of immune responses, we developed a combination, intranasal, adjuvant integrating a nanoemulsion-based adjuvant (NE) that activates TLRs and NLRP3 with an RNA agonist of RIG-I (IVT DI). This rationally designed combination adjuvant yielded a synergistic immune response with highly robust humoral and cellular responses towards SARS-CoV-2 using a recombinant spike protein S1 subunit antigen. Significantly enhanced virus neutralizing antibody titers were achieved towards both a homologous SARS-CoV-2 virus (IC50 titers of 1:104) and a mouse-adapted variant containing the N501Y mutation present in the B1.1.7 UK and B.1.351 South Africa variants. Importantly, NE/IVT DI dramatically enhanced the TH1-biased cellular response, which is expected to provide more durable and tailored cellular immunity while avoiding potential vaccine enhanced pathology previously associated with TH2-biased responses in some SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines. Our previous work with the NE/IVT DI adjuvant has demonstrated its compatibility with a broad range of antigen types. Thus, this combined adjuvant approach has strong potential for improving the induced immune profile for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates such that better protection against future drift variants and prevention of transmission can be achieved.",Sonia Jangra; Jeffrey J Landers; Raveen Rathnasinghe; Katarzyna W Janczak; Marilia Cascalho; Andrew A Kennedy; Andrew W Tai; James R Baker Jr.; Michael Schotsaert; Pamela T Wong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431484,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431484,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
299,Homologous and heterologous serological response to the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2,"The increasing numbers of infected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses serious threats to public health and the global economy. Most SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) and some the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which is the major antigen of SARS-CoV-2. While the antibody response to RBD has been extensively characterized, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the NTD protein are less well studied. Using 227 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NTD-specific antibodies could be induced during infection. As compared to the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 NTD response is less cross-reactive with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an altered antigenicity when expressed alone. Overall, our results suggest that while NTD offers an alternative strategy for serology testing, it may not be suitable as an immunogen for vaccine development.",Huibin Lv; Owen Tak-Yin Tsang; Ray T.

300,Rotavirus as an Expression Platform of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein,"Rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA virus, is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in young children. The introduction of live oral rotavirus vaccines has reduced the incidence of rotavirus disease in many countries. To explore the possibility of establishing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified segment 7 RNAs that contained coding sequences for NSP3 and FLAG-tagged portions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus, confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (e.g., NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR) with sizes smaller than the S1 fragment.

ImportanceAmong the vaccines administered to children in the US and many other countries are those targeting rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA virus that is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis. In this study, we have examined the feasibility of modifying the rotavirus genome by reverse genetics, such that the virus could serve as an expression vector of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Results were obtained showing that recombinant rotaviruses can be generated that express domains of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, including the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a common target of neutralizing antibodies produced in individuals infected by the virus. Our findings raise the possibility of creating a combined rotavirus-COVID-19 vaccine that could be used in place of current rotavirus vaccines.",Asha A Philip; John T Patton,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431835,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431835,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False

While a tremendous amount of OMICs data has been generated from COVID-19 patient samples, the host antiviral response and markers of disease progression remain to be completely delineated. In this study, we have conducted a meta-analysis of published transcriptome and proteome profiles of the nasal swab and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of COVID-19 patients to identify high confidence upregulated host factors. This was followed by rank ordering, shortlisting, and validation of overexpression of a set of host factors in a nasal swab/BALF samples from a cohort of COVID-19 positive/negative, symptomatic/asymptomatic individuals. This led to the identification of host antiviral response in the upper respiratory tract and potential prognostic markers. Notably, SEPRIN B3 and Thioredoxin were identified as potential antiviral factors. In addition, several S100 family proteins were found to be upregulated in COVID-19 specific and disease severity dependent manner. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the host antiviral mechanisms and COVID-19 disease progression.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431825,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431825,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
302,SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein dually regulates innate immune responses,"The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, may trigger immunosuppression in the early stage and a cytokine storm in the late stage of infection, however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein dually regulated innate immune responses, i.e., the low-dose N protein suppressed type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and inflammatory cytokines, whereas high-dose N protein promoted IFN-I signaling and inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein interacted with the tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), thereby dually regulating the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, STAT1 and STAT2. Additionally, low-dose N protein combined with TRIM25 could suppress retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) ubiquitination and activation. Our findings revealed a regulatory mechanism of innate immune responses by the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, which would contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses, and development of more effective strategies for controlling COVID-19.",Yinghua Zhao; Liyan Sui; Ping Wu; Wenfang Wang; Guangyun Tan; Zedong Wang; Yang Yu; Zhijun Hou; Guoqing Wang; Quan Liu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431755,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431755,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
303,A glimpse into the diverse cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific cellular immune response may prove to be essential for long-term immune protection against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To assess COVID-19-specific immunity in the population, we synthesized selected peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional proteins, including Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as target antigens. Survey of the T cell precursur frequencies in healthy individuals specific to these viral antigens demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was further confirmed by in vitro induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses using dendritic cell (DC)/T cell coculture, which supported the corresponding T cell precursor frequencies in each of the individuals tested. In general, the combination of all five viral antigen pools induced the strongest cellular immune response, yet individual donors responded differently to different viral antigens. Importantly, in vitro restimulation of the T cells with the DC-peptides induced increased anti-viral immune responses in all individuals even in the no responders, suggesting that repeated antigen stimulation could elicit a broad protection in immune naive population. Our analysis recapitulates the critical role of cellular immunity in fighting COVID-19 and the importance of analyzing anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell response in addition to antibody response in the population.

ImportanceFacing the rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in the world, current emphasis on antibody-producing vaccines needs a quick revisit. The virus-specific cellular immunity may prove to be essential for long-term protection against COVID-19. This study designed a series of antigenic peptides encompassing the conserved and/or essential domains of Spike (S), Membrane (M), envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as targets to assess Covid-19-specific immunity in the population. The results demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was verified by in vitro generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from these subjects. The study suggested that individuals responded differently to the different viral antigens, and importantly, repeated stimulation could produce virus specific T cells in all individuals, including the no responders.

Here, we make a retrospective analysis of the first wave of the epidemic in Spain and provide a set of useful insights to optimize actions in the near future. We have reconstructed the exposure times, from infection to detectability, to correctly estimate the reproduction number Rt. This enables us to analyze counterfactual scenarios to understand the impact of earlier or later responses, decoupling containment measures from natural immunity.

305,Accuracy of Smartphone Integrated Pulse Oximetry Meets Full FDA Clearance Standards for Clinical Use.,"BackgroundPulse oximetry is used as an assessment tool to gauge the severity of COVID-19 infection and identify patients at risk of poor outcomes. 1,2,3,4 The pandemic highlights the need for accurate pulse oximetry, particularly at home, as infection rates increase in multiple global regions including the UK, USA and South Africa 5. Over 100 million Samsung smartphones containing dedicated biosensors (Maxim Integrated Inc, San Jose, CA) and preloaded Apps to perform pulse oximetry, are in use globally. We performed detailed in human hypoxia testing on the Samsung S9 smartphone to determine if this integrated hardware meets full FDA/ISO requirements for clinical pulse oximetry.

MethodsThe accuracy of integrated pulse oximetry in the Samsung 9 smartphone during stable arterial oxygen saturations (SaO2) between 70% and 100% was evaluated in 12 healthy subjects. Inspired oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide partial pressures were monitored and adjusted via a partial rebreathing circuit to achieve stable target SaO2 plateaus between 70% and 100%. Arterial blood samples were taken at each plateau and saturation measured on each blood sample using ABL-90FLEX blood gas analyzer. Bias, calculated from smartphone readings minus the corresponding arterial blood sample, was reported as root mean square deviation (RMSD).

FindingsThe RMSD of the over 257 data points based on blood sample analysis obtained from 12 human volunteers tested was 2.6%.

InterpretationEvaluation of the smartphone pulse oximeter performance is within requirements of <3.5% RMSD blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) value for FDA/ISO clearance for clinical pulse oximetry. This is the first report of smartphone derived pulse oximetry measurements that meet full FDA/ISO accuracy certification requirements. Both Samsung S9 and S10 contain the same integrated pulse oximeter, thus over 100 million smartphones in current global circulation could be used to obtain clinically accurate spot SpO2 measurements to support at home assessment of COVID-19 patients.",Sara H Browne; Mike Bernstein; Philip E.

DesignRepresentative cross-sectional surveys of adults, collected monthly between August 2018 and July 2020.

SettingEngland.

Participants36,980 adults ([&ge;]18y).

MeasurementsIndependent variables were survey month (pre-lockdown: August-February vs. lockdown months: April-July) and year (pandemic: 2019/20 vs. comparator: 2018/19). Smoking outcomes were smoking prevalence, cessation, quit attempts, quit success, and use of evidence-based or remote cessation support. Drinking outcomes were high-risk drinking prevalence, alcohol reduction attempts, and use of evidence-based or remote support. Moderators were age, sex, and occupational social grade (ABC1=more advantaged/C2DE=less advantaged).

FindingsRelative to changes over the same time period in 2018/19, lockdown was associated with significant increases in smoking prevalence (+24.7% in 2019/20 vs. 0.0% in 2018/19, ORadj=1.35[95%CI=1.12-1.63]) and quit attempts (+39.9% vs. -22.2%, ORadj=2.48[1.76-3.50]) among 18-34 year-olds, but not older groups. Increases in cessation (+156.4% vs. -12.5%, ORadj=3.08[1.86-5.09]) and the success rate of quit attempts (+99.2% vs. +0.8%, ORadj=2.29[1.31-3.98]) were also observed, and did not differ significantly by age, sex, or social grade. Lockdown was associated with a significant increase in high-risk drinking prevalence across all sociodemographic groups (+39.5% vs. -7.8%, ORadj=1.80[1.64-1.98]), with particularly high increases among women (ORadj=2.17[1.87-2.53]) and social grades C2DE (ORadj=2.34[2.00-2.74]). Alcohol reduction attempts increased significantly among high-risk drinkers from social grades ABC1 (ORadj=2.31[1.78-3.00]) but not C2DE (ORadj=1.25[0.83-1.88]), with larger increases among those aged 18-34 (ORadj=2.56[1.72-3.81]) and [&ge;]60 (ORadj=1.43[1.05-1.95]) than 35-59 (ORadj=2.51[1.51-4.18]). There were few significant changes in use of support for smoking cessation or alcohol reduction, although samples were small.

ConclusionsIn England, the first Covid-19 lockdown was associated with increased smoking prevalence among younger adults, and increased high-risk drinking prevalence among all adults. Smoking cessation activity also increased: more younger smokers made quit attempts during lockdown and more smokers quit successfully. Socioeconomic disparities in drinking behaviour were evident: high-risk drinking increased by more among women and those from less advantaged social grades (C2DE) but the rate of reduction attempts increased only among the more advantaged social grades (ABC1).",Sarah E Jackson; Emma Beard; Colin Angus; Matt Field; Jamie Brown,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251766,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251766,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True

We aim to provide an overview of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients, and identification, treatment of early stage, especially for the patients with poor prognosis.

Data SourcesPubMed, CNKI and Google Scholar.

Study SelectionWe searched for published retrospective studies that described epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients in China by April 14th, 2020 with search terms. Some studies were excluded according to criteria. Finally, 53 studies were included.

Data ExtractionCharacteristics of the COVID-19 patients available from included articles were extracted, reorganized and recorded into electronic data forms.

Data SynthesisCharacteristics of patients in the included studies were summarized and analyzed for median-interquartile ranges and univariable odds ratio.

ConclusionThis study summarized, analyzed and compared epidemiological, clinical characteristics and estimated univariable risk factors among confirmed COVID-19 patients either in former epicenter, in severe condition, with ICU admission or not of early stage. Higher proportions of patients were found to have older age and more comorbidities, typical characteristics on admission and complications either in former epicenter, with severe condition or ICU admission. No evidence showed that patients who were male or had smoking history had higher susceptibility, but they were significant risk factors for severe condition. Some self-implementable traditional Chinese medicine therapies conducted for immunity improvement, control of comorbidities and reduction of some medicine intake. Limited evidence revealed that some characteristics of the disease might be changing with human-to-human transmission, and more research, especially international collaboration, is needed.

308,Interrogating structural inequalities in COVID-19 Mortality in England and Wales,"BackgroundNumerous observational studies have highlighted structural inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in the UK. Such studies often fail to consider the complex spatial nature of such inequalities in their analysis, leading to the potential for bias and an inability to reach conclusions about the most appropriate structural levels for policy intervention.

MethodsWe use publicly available population data on COVID-19 related- and all-cause mortality between March and July 2020 in England and Wales to investigate the spatial scale of such inequalities. We propose a multiscale approach to simultaneously consider four spatial scales at which processes driving inequality may act and apportion inequality between these.

ResultsAdjusting for population age structure, number of care homes and residing in the North we find highest regional inequality in March and June/July. We find finer-grained within-region increased steadily from March until July. The importance of spatial context increases over the study period. No analogous pattern is visible for non-COVID mortality. Higher relative deprivation is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality at all stages of the pandemic but does not explain structural inequalities.

ConclusionsResults support initial stochastic viral introduction in the South, with initially high inequality decreasing before the establishment of regional trends by June and July, prior to reported regionality of the ""second-wave"". We outline how this framework can help identify structural factors driving such processes, and offer suggestions for a long-term, locally-targeted model of pandemic relief in tandem with regional support to buffer the social context of the area.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health with a specific focus on schizotypal traits in the general population of Germany and the UK, comparing responses from April/May vs. September/October","Studies reported a strong impact on mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March-June, 2020. In this study, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on mental health in general and on schizoptypal traits specifically in general population samples of the UK (N 1st timepoint=239, N 2nd timepoint= 126) and Germany (N 1st timepoint= 543, N 2nd timepoint=401) over two timepoints, April/May and September/October 2020. We were able to show that whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cut-off for further psychological investigation declined from the first to the second timepoint in both countries, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were increased at the second timepoint. We investigated potential predictors, using regression models. For schizotypy, we detected a doubling or more of the estimated impact from the first to the second timepoint, including stronger perceived loneliness, increased use of drugs, stronger financial burden, and decreased regular exercise and sleep. These effects predicted GSI, however with a lower increase of impact from the first to the second timepoint. We furthermore found that living in the UK was a predictor for higher schizotypal scores or GSI. However, the results are highly comparable between the two countries. In conclusion, this study shows that while the general psychological impact decreases, potentially showing a normative response to an exceptional situation; schizotypy scores increase, revealing a stronger impact of loneliness, drug use, and financial burden. This development might create an increased risk for developing psychosis in some individuals.

310,Impacts of COVID-19 on long-term health and health care use,"AimTo explore impacts of mild and severe COVID-19 on acute and long-term utilization of primary care, inpatient- and outpatient specialist health care.

MethodsIn all persons tested for the SARS-CoV-2 in Norway March 1st to November 1st 2020 (N=1 257 831), we used a difference-in-differences design to contrast the monthly health care use before and after testing, across patients with negative test (no COVID-19) and 1) positive test, not hospitalized (mild COVID-19) and 2) positive test, hospitalized (severe COVID-19). We studied all-cause- and cause-specific health care use for digestive, circulatory, respiratory, endocrine/metabolic/nutritional, genitourinary, eye/ear, musculoskeletal, mental, skin, blood and general/unspecified conditions.

ResultsMild COVID-19 impacted on primary care due to respiratory conditions at 0-3 months after having tested positive (786% increase). Severe COVID-19 impacted on visits due to respiratory-(337-3316% increase), circulatory-(166-205% increase), endocrine/metabolic/nutritional-(168-791% increase) as well as visits due to general/unspecified conditions (48-431% increase) in outpatient and inpatient specialist care 0-3 months after being tested. Severe COVID-19 also impacted on outpatient specialist care after 4-6 months, for respiratory and circulatory conditions (199-246% increase) and general/unspecified conditions (40% increase).

ConclusionOur findings imply that mild COVID-19 does not persist to cause a need for health care beyond two months after having tested positive.

311,Use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy among Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: A Single-Center Experience,"COVID-19 Disease has strained our healthcare system. Convalescent plasma has been used to treat emerging infectious diseases -Influenza A/B, SARS-CoV, Ebola virus and now SARS-CoV 2.

OBJECTIVEThis study aims to determine the outcome and clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma transfusion at Cardinal Santos Medical Center.

METHODSThis is a retrospective cohort analytical study of 75 patients who received convalescent plasma.

RESULTSMedian time from admission to CP transfusion was 3 days. Majority of patients received additional therapies including dexamethasone (100%); Remdesivir (95%); antibiotics (100%), tocilizumab (65%); hemoperfusion (88%) or combination of these. Among the survivors, the median LOS was 15 days while non-survivors have a median LOS of 6 days. One patient (1.33%) had mild transfusion reaction. Four patients (5.33%) developed DVT despite anti-coagulation. There was improvement in the inflammatory markers (LDH pvalue 0.04, CRP pvalue 0.00, Ferritin pvalue 0.0001). There was improvement in the pulmonary parameters -increase in mean PaO2, mean SaO2, and mean PFR; and decrease in mean FiO2 and mean RR post-treatment. Median LOS is 14 days for the CP group vs 11 days for the non-CP group. Mortality rate among the CP group is 25.33% while the non-CP group was 26.67%. LOS and mortality rate did not reach statistical significance.

CONCLUSIONSThere was no significant difference in mortality and length of hospital stay in patients given CP vs controls. CP might have a role in the improvement of inflammatory markers and pulmonary status.",Flordeluna Z Mesina; Claudette G Mangahas; Ellen M Gatchalian; Mary Sheila A Ramos; Rosalio P Torres,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251824,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251824,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True
312,The efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials,"The novel coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, critically impacting public health systems. A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid hub/PubMed, Scopus, ISI web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P=0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P=0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P=0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting.",Soheil Hassanpour; Morteza Arab-Zozani; Bahman Amani; Forough Heidarzad; Mohammad Fathalipour; Rudolph Martinez-de-Hoyo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251693,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251693,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True
313,"Protocol for Safe, Affordable, and Reproducible Isolation and Quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from Wastewater","The following protocol describes our workflow for processing wastewater with the goal of detecting the genetic signal of SARS-CoV-2. The steps include pasteurization, virus concentration, RNA extraction, and quantification by RT-qPCR. We include auxiliary steps that provide new users with tools and strategies that will help troubleshoot key steps in the process. This protocol is one of the safest, cheapest, and most reproducible approaches for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Furthermore, the RNA obtained using this protocol, minus the pasteurization step, can be sequenced both using a targeted approach sequencing specific regions or the whole genome. The protocol was adopted by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in August 2020 to support their efforts in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater in all five boroughs of the city. Owing to a pasteurization step, it is safe for use in a BSL1+ facility. This step also increases the genetic signal of the virus while making the protocol safe for the personnel involved.

314,Overall burden and characteristics of COVID-19 in the United States during 2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health systems and economies throughout the world during 2020 and was particularly devastating for the United States. Many of epidemiological features that produced observed rates of morbidity and mortality have not been thoroughly assessed. Here we use a data-driven model-inference approach to simulate the pandemic at county-scale in the United States during 2020 and estimate critical, time-varying epidemiological properties underpinning the dynamics of the virus. The pandemic in the US during 2020 was characterized by an overall ascertainment rate of 21.6% (95% credible interval (CI):18.9 - 25.5%). Population susceptibility at years end was 68.8% (63.4 - 75.3%), indicating roughly one third of the US population had been infected. Community infectious rates, the percentage of people harboring a contagious infection, rose above 0.8% (0.6 - 1.0%) before the end of the year, and were as high as 2.4% in some major metropolitan areas. In contrast, the infection fatality rate fell to 0.3% by years end; however, community control of transmission, estimated from trends of the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, slackened during successive pandemic waves. In the coming months, as vaccines are distributed and administered and new more transmissible virus variants emerge and spread, greater use of non-pharmaceutical interventions will be needed.",Sen Pei; Teresa K.

318,Should We Delay the Second COVID-19 Vaccine Dose?,"Due to the shortage in COVID-19 vaccine supplies and the alarming sanitary situation engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have opted to delay the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for some period of time, aiming at getting the first dose of the vaccine to a large number of the population, before proceeding with the second doses [7, 6]. This strategy has sparked some heated debates world-wide for its pros and cons, and no clear consensus is reached among experts [5, 3]. Without taking side in this matter, we tried to answer the following question, from a pure mathematical perspective: should we delay the second dose of the vaccine or not?. We show that the answer to this question depends tightly on the efficacy of the first and the second COVID-19 vaccine doses. In particular, if the first dose is more than 50% efficient, the optimal procedure to maximize the number of effectively vaccinated sub-population is to delay the second vaccine as much as possible (the maximum period between the two doses prescribed by the clinical recommendations). On the other hand, if the efficacy of the first dose is less than 50% and the efficacy of the second dose exceeds a certain threshold, then it would be optimal to administer the second dose as quickly as possible (while respecting the minimum period between the two does as prescribed by the clinical recommendations). We provide explicitly the expression of this threshold as a function of the efficacy of first dose.",Intissar Harizi; Soulaimane Berkane; Abdelhamid Tayebi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251652,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251652,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True

Spearmans correlation coefficients were used for the statistical analysis. Results show that air temperature and wind speed were positively correlated with COVID-19 cases, while air relative humidity showed negative correlation. As seen in several recent studies, climate factors and the spread of COVID-19 seem to be related. Our study corroborates this hypothesis for less densely populated and less polluted regions.

320,E484K mutation in SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhances binding affinity with hACE2 but reduces interactions with neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies: Binding free energy calculation studies,"The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 100 million infections and over 2 million deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody drugs design.",Wei Bu Wang; Yu Liang; Yu Qin Jin; Jing Zhang; Ji Guo Su; Qi Ming Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431566,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431566,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
321,Association of CXCR6 with COVID-19 severity: Delineating the host genetic factors in transcriptomic regulation,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that mainly affects the host respiratory system with [~]80% asymptomatic or mild cases and [~]5% severe cases. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic loci associated with the severe COVID-19 symptoms. Delineating the genetic variants and genes is important for better understanding its biological mechanisms.

MethodsWe implemented integrative approaches, including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), colocalization analysis and functional element prediction analysis, to interpret the genetic risks using two independent GWAS datasets in lung and immune cells. To understand the context-specific molecular alteration, we further performed deep learning-based single cell transcriptomic analyses on a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) dataset from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.

ResultsWe discovered and replicated the genetically regulated expression of CXCR6 and CCR9 genes. These two genes have a protective effect on the lung and a risk effect on whole blood, respectively. The colocalization analysis of GWAS and cis-expression quantitative trait loci highlighted the regulatory effect on CXCR6 expression in lung and immune cells. In the lung resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells, we found a 3.32-fold decrease of cell proportion and lower expression of CXCR6 in the severe than moderate patients using the BALF transcriptomic dataset. Pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs were highlighted in TRM cells trajectory from moderate to severe patients.

ConclusionsCXCR6 from the 3p21.31 locus is associated with severe COVID-19. CXCR6 tends to have a lower expression in lung TRM cells of severe patients, which aligns with the protective effect of CXCR6 from TWAS analysis. We illustrate one potential mechanism of host genetic factor impacting the severity of COVID-19 through regulating the expression of CXCR6 and TRM cell proportion and stability.

The measles virus (MV)-vectored vaccine is an attractive candidate given the measles vaccines extensive safety history, well-established manufacturing process, and induction of strong, long-lasting immunity. We developed an MV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using either the full-length spike (S) or S2 subunit as the antigen. While the S2 antigen failed to induce neutralizing antibodies, the prefusion-stabilized, full-length S (MV-ATU2-SF-2P-dER) construct proved to be an attractive vaccine candidate, eliciting strong Th1-dominant T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses against the S antigen while minimizing reactivity to the vector itself.

323,A selective sweep in the Spike gene has driven SARS-CoV-2 human adaptation,"While SARS-CoV-2 likely has animal origins1, the viral genetic changes necessary to adapt this animal-derived ancestral virus to humans are largely unknown, mostly due to low levels of sequence polymorphism and the notorious difficulties in experimental manipulations of coronavirus genomes. We scanned more than 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for selective sweep signatures and found that a distinct footprint of positive selection is located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the Receptor-Binding Domain of the Spike protein, which likely played a critical role in overcoming species barriers and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans. Structural analysis indicated that the substitution of threonine with an alanine in SARS-CoV-2 concomitantly removes a predicted glycosylation site at N370, resulting in more favorable binding predictions to human ACE2, the cellular receptor. Using a novel bacteria-free cloning system for manipulating RNA virus genomes, we experimentally validated that this SARS-CoV-2-unique substitution significantly increases replication in human cells relative to its putative ancestral variant. Notably, this mutations impact on virus replication in human cells was much greater than that of the Spike D614G mutant, which has been widely reported to have been selected for during human-to-human transmission2,3.",Lin Kang; Guijuan He; Amanda K.

Antiviral interferon responses are critical to outcome of SARS-CoV-2. Yet little is known about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity in this tissue. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics to a primary cell model of human primary nasal epithelium differentiated at air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated widespread tropism for nasal epithelial cell types. The host response was dominated by type I and III IFNs and interferon-stimulated gene products. Nevertheless, this response was notably delayed in onset compared to viral gene expression, and thus failed to impact substantially on SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, when provided prior to infection, recombinant IFN{beta} or IFN{lambda}1 induced an efficient antiviral state that potently restricted SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, preserving epithelial barrier integrity.

Vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs circulating in animals have the potential to prevent future betaCoV pandemics.

Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization titer of 47,216, and robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric RBD protein also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-neutralizing antibodies, albeit at lower titers. These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may provide some protection from future zoonotic betaCoV outbreaks, and provide a platform for further development of pan-betaCoV nanoparticle vaccines.",Kevin O Saunders; Esther Lee; Robert Parks; David R Martinez; Dapeng Li; Haiyan Chen; Robert J Edwards; Sophie M.

Residues E484 and K417 in the receptor-binding site (RBS) are both mutated in lineages first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (B.1.1.28.1). The nAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 patients are preferentially encoded by certain heavy-chain germline genes and the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2) can each bind the RBS in two different binding modes. However, their binding and neutralization are abrogated by either the E484K or K417N mutation, whereas nAbs to the cross-reactive CR3022 and S309 sites are largely unaffected.

327,A rigorous framework for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutational ensemble from genomic and structural features,"The recent release of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from several countries has provided clues into the potential antigenic drift of the coronavirus population. In particular, the genomic instability observed in the spike protein necessitates immediate action and further exploration in the context of viral-host interactions. Here we dynamically track 3,11,795 genome sequences of spike protein, which comprises 2,584 protein mutations. We reveal mutational genomic ensemble at different timing and geographies, that evolves on four distinct residues. In addition to the well-established N501 mutational cluster, we detect the presence of three novel clusters, namely A222, N439, and S477. The robust examination of structural features from 44 known cryo-EM structures showed that the virus is deploying many mutations within these clusters on structurally heterogeneous regions. One such dominant variant D614G was also simulated using molecular dynamics simulations and, as compared to wild-type, we found higher stability with human ACE2 receptor. There is also a significant overlap of mutational clusters on known epitopes, indicating putative interference with antibody binding. Thus, we propose that the resulting coaxility of mutational clusters is the most efficient feature of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and provides precise mutant combinations that can enable future vaccine re-positioning.",Saman Fatihi; Surabhi Rathore; Ankit Pathak; Deepanshi Gahlot; Mitali Mukerji; Nidhi Jatana; Lipi Thukral,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431625,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431625,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
328,"Multiple Sites on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein are Susceptible to Proteolysis by Cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V","SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the viruss capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID-19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated.",Keval Bollavaram; Tiffanie Leeman; Akhil Kulkarni; Sophia Upshaw; Maggie Lee; Jiabei Yang; Hannah Song; Manu O Platt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431617,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431617,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
329,How the replication and transcription complex of SARS-CoV-2 functions in leader-to-body fusion,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although unprecedented efforts are underway to develop therapeutic strategies against this disease, scientists have acquired only a little knowledge regarding the structures and functions of the CoV replication and transcription complex (RTC) and 16 non-structural proteins, named NSP1-16.

ResultsIn the present study, we determined the theoretical arrangement of NSP12-16 in the global RTC structure. This arrangement answered how the CoV RTC functions in the ""leader-to-body fusion"" process. More importantly, our results revealed the associations between multiple functions of the RTC, including RNA synthesis, NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation, and CoV replication and transcription at the molecular level. As the most important finding, transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) hairpins were reported for the first time to help understand the multiple functions of CoV RTCs and the strong recombination abilities of CoVs.

ConclusionsTRS hairpins can be used to identify recombination regions in CoV genomes. We provide a systematic understanding of the structures and functions of the RTC, leading to the eventual determination of the global CoV RTC structure. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, providing a basis for future studies. Future drug design targeting SARS-CoV-2 needs to consider protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in the RTC, particularly the complex structure of NSP15 and NSP16 with the TRS hairpin.",Xin Li; Qiang Zhao; Jia Chang; Guangyou Duan; Jinlong Bei; Tung On Yau; Jianyi Yang; Jishou Ruan; Bingjun He; Gao Shan,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431652,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431652,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False

A previously developed thermodynamic model of protein conformations predicted that SARS CoV-2 is very close to a thermodynamic critical point, which makes it highly infectious but also easily displaced by a spike-based vaccine because there is a tradeoff between transmissibility and robustness2. The model identified a small cluster of four key mutations of SARS CoV-2 that promotes much stronger viral attachment and viral spreading. Here we apply the model to two new strains (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351)3 and predict, using no free parameters, how the new mutations can further enhance infectiousness.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431437,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431437,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
331,Traditional use of Cissampelos pareira L. for hormone disorder and fever provides molecular links of ESR1 modulation to viral inhibition,"In traditional systems, a single herbal formulation is often used in the treatment of diverse diseases, including some that are newly emergent and prevalent today. We provide here a multi-omics framework to probe the molecular basis of a multicomponent example herb, Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) used in the treatment of hormonal disorders and fever in Ayurveda. Cipa treated MCF7 cells exhibit downregulation of signatures of estrogen response. 38 constituent molecules in Cipa potentially bind ({triangleup}G< -7.5) with ER at the same site as estrogen. Cipa transcriptome signatures in the connectivity map exhibit positive scores with protein translation inhibitors and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response. This includes the knockdown signature of RPL7, a coactivator of ESRI with a connectivity score > 99.92. This axis was found to be upregulated in the COVID-19 patient transcriptome. The antiviral activity through ESR1 modulation was validated in the DENV-2 infection model. We further observed 98% inhibition of SARs-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. A few of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. This study provides a novel framework for querying the molecular links of multicomponent Ayurveda formulations and explains their use in the treatment of disparate diseases.

332,Potent neutralization antibodies induced by a recombinant trimeric Spike protein vaccine candidate containing PIKA adjuvant for COVID-19,"Neutralizing antibodies are critical to prevent corona virus infection. The structures of immunogens to elicit most potent neutralization antibodies are still under investigation. Here we tested the immunogenicity of the trimeric, full length Spike protein with 2 proline mutations to preserve its prefusion conformation. Recombinant trimeric Spike protein expressed by CHO cells was used with polyI:C (PIKA) adjuvant to immunize mice by 0-7-14 day schedule. The results showed that Spike-specific antibody was induced at day 21 with titer of more than 50,000 in average as measured by direct binding to Spike protein. The titer of neutralization reached more than 1000 in average when tested by a pseudo-virus system, using monoclonal antibodies (40592-MM57 and 40591-MM43) with neutralizing IC50 at 1 g/ml as standards. Protein/peptide array showed that the antibodies induced by trimeric S protein vaccine bind similarly to natural infection with the receptor binding domain (RBD) as major immunodominant region. No linear epitopes were found in RBD, although several linear epitopes were found in C-terminal domain right after RBD, and heptad repeat regions.

333,Community end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial findings of a UK primary care survey,"BackgroundThousands of people in the UK have required end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary healthcare teams (general practice and community nursing services) have provided the majority of this care, alongside specialist colleagues. There is a need to learn from this experience in order to inform future service delivery and planning.

AimTo understand the views of general practitioners and community nurses providing end-of-life care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design and SettingA web-based, UK-wide questionnaire survey circulated via professional general practice and community nursing networks during September and October 2020.

MethodResponses were analysed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsValid responses were received from 559 individuals (387 community nurses, 156 General Practitioners (GPs) and 16 unspecified role), from all regions of the UK. The majority reported increased involvement in providing community end-of-life care. Contrasting and potentially conflicting roles emerged between GPs and community nurses. There was increased use of remote consultations, particularly by GPs. Community nurses took greater responsibility in most aspects of end-of-life care practice, particularly face-to-face care, but reported feeling isolated. For some GPs and community nurses, there has been considerable emotional distress.

ConclusionPrimary healthcare services are playing a critical role in meeting increased need for end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have adapted rapidly, but the significant emotional impact, especially for community nurses, needs addressing alongside rebuilding trusting and supportive team dynamics.

334,Workplace measures against COVID-19 during the winter third wave in Japan: company size-based differences,"ObjectivesLittle is known about workplace measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan after the first state of emergency period, especially in micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti-COVID-19 measures in Japanese enterprises, considering company size.

MethodsThis study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the p-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes.

ResultsFor the 27,036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working and restricting eating and drinking at personal workspaces were implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 15% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all p-values < .001).

ConclusionsWe found that various responses to COVID-19 had been taken in workplaces. However, some measures, including remote working, were still not well implemented, especially in smaller enterprises.

335,An alternative approach for bioanalytical assay development for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2,"Wastewater-based epidemiology could be applied to track down SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at high spatio-temporal resolution and could potentially be used as an early-warning for emergence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the general population. Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in monitoring the spread of the virus in the population and controlling possible outbreaks. However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW).

Unlike predecessors, method development of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads (in combination with seeding IWW with a surrogate coronavirus). This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,...). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering pore sizes did not improve our limit of detection and quantification. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E_Sarbeco-gene.

This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. Interestingly, qPCR results were comparable with dPCR results suggesting that qPCR is a valid method. In this study, dPCR was also used as a proxy to assess the precision of qPCR. In this light, dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/{micro}L), indicating that variability in bioanalytical assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be substantial.

On average, the N2-gene showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 {degrees}C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene in IWW.

Although WBE can already aid in filling some knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, future WBE studies should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with regards to methodological limitations.

336,"Responsive caregiving, opportunities for early learning, and children's safety and security during COVID-19: A rapid review","IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life and programs and services that promote and protect early childhood development. Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting childrens development.

MethodologyThis rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and childrens safety and security.

ResultsThere are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education.

ConclusionThe findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for action-oriented implementation studies - those that go beyond identifying trends and begin to pinpoint ""what works"" to effectively promote and protect nurturing care during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSThe most fundamental promotive experiences in the early years of life to reach optimal development come from nurturing care and protection received from parents, family, and community, which have lifelong benefits including improved health and wellbeing. Health and other emergencies are detrimental to the provision of nurturing care.

What are the new findings?Findings from this rapid review reveal numerous areas of concern, including families reporting mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. As with other features of this pandemic, not all families are affected equally: financially vulnerable families are much more likely to experience negative ramifications. The pandemic is also disproportionately affecting parents and other caregivers with young children, particularly mothers, those with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and those caring for children with disabilities.

What do the new findings imply?Findings highlight the need for action by governments, civil society, international and community-based organizations to improve support for families so that the pandemic does not break the provision of nurturing care and wipe out decades of progress, especially for vulnerable families and children.",Kerrie Proulx; Rachel Lenzi-Weisbecker; Rachel Rachel; Kristy Hackett; Vanessa Cavallera; Bernadette Daelmans; Tarun Dua,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251507,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251507,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
337,Fear and death anxiety among Latin American doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic,"IntroductionA patients death elicits various feelings arise in doctors such as impotence and guilt that could trigger physical or psychological symptoms. Despite its impact, few studies have explored anxiety and fear of death among physicians.

ObjectiveTo evaluate perceptions and responses to ones mortality among Latin American physicians treating COVID-19 patients.

MethodologyThis cross-sectional study utilized the Collet-Lester Modified Fear of Death Scale and the Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) to collect data from physicians in Latin America.

Results219 doctors from Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Bolivia filled out the online questionnaire. Fear of death among the sample population ranged from 56.2% to 90%. Furthermore, the prevalence of ""High Anxiety"" was 80.8%. A statistically significant association was found between fear according to age and time of graduation (p = 0.010 and p = 0.020, respectively). No differences were found by gender, age, and country of origin or practice.

ConclusionPhysicians experience feelings of helplessness and guilt upon the death of a patient and those feelings can trigger physical or psychological symptoms.

338,A multi-centre service evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation of newly diagnosed cancers and type 1 diabetes in children in the UK,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in patterns of presentation to Emergency Departments (ED). Child health professionals were concerned that this could contribute to the delayed diagnosis of life-threatening conditions, including childhood cancer (CC) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Our multicentre, UK-based service evaluation assessed diagnostic intervals and disease severity for these conditions.

MethodsWe collected presentation route, timing and disease severity for children with newly diagnosed CC in three principal treatment centres, and T1DM in four centres between 1st January - 31st July 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We assessed the impact of lockdown on total diagnostic interval (TDI), patient interval (PI), system interval (SI) and disease severity.

FindingsFor CCs and T1DM, the route to diagnosis and severity of illness at presentation were unchanged across all time periods. Diagnostic intervals for CCs during lockdown were comparable to that in 2019 (TDI 4.6, PI 1.1 and SI 2.1 weeks), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 2.7 weeks). Diagnostic intervals for T1DM during lockdown were similar to that in 2019 (TDI 16 vs 15 and PI 14 vs 14 days), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 21 days).

InterpretationThere is no evidence of diagnostic delay or increased illness severity for CC or T1DM, during the first phase of the pandemic across the participating centres. This provides reassuring data for children and families with these life-changing conditions.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThis project was initiated after the first national lockdown in March 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. At the design stage, Medline was searched (with no language limit), using the keywords ((Cancer) OR (neoplasm) OR (Type 1 diabetes mellitus)) AND ((Covid-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2) OR (Pandemics)) AND ((Emergency department attendances) OR (diabetes ketoacidosis) OR (Delayed diagnosis) OR (interval) OR (wait)) to identify publications reporting the impact of the pandemic and public health measures on both overall and paediatric healthcare services. Significant changes in service utilisation in the UK were reported following the commencement of the first lockdown, including a 49% reduction in emergency department attendances in the week following the lockdown; and two adult studies reported that referral via the urgent two-week wait cancer referral diagnoses decreased by 84% from Mar-May and 60% in June 2020. As for Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), a 30 patient UK-study reported an increase in newly diagnosed T1DM during the first six weeks of lockdown. Increased proportions of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation were also reported in an Italian survey involving 53 paediatric diabetes centres. Through the search we identified a need for multi-centre, more thorough assessment on referral pathways, time taken from symptom onset to diagnosis, and its association with severity at presentation for children diagnosed with life-changing conditions during the national lockdown.

Added value of this studyOur findings suggest that the first national lockdown in the UK were not associated with delayed diagnosis of childhood cancer or type 1 diabetes at participating centres. This provides reassuring information for children and families with these life-changing conditions.

ImplicationWe believe that our study can play a key role in allaying parental and professional concern. it is important to establish whether subsequent public health measures have impacted the diagnostic interval in the context of an evolving backlog of patient referrals across the UK.",- COVID-19 Pandemic UK-based Interest Group of Childhood Cancer and Diabetes; Gemma Williams; Ross McLean; Jo-Fen Liu; Timothy Ritzmann; Madhumita Dandapani; Dhurgshaarna Shanmugavadivel; Pooja Sachdev; Mark Brougham; Rod Mitchell; Nicholas T Conway; James Law; Alice Cunnington; Gbemi Ogunnaike; Karen Brougham; Elizabeth Bayman; David A Walker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251149,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251149,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
339,SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays in serial samples reveal earlier seroconversion in acutely ill COVID-19 patients developing ARDS,"ObjectivesDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has been suggested for (1) screening populations for disease prevalence, (2) diagnostics, and (3) guiding therapeutic applications. Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts.

Methods443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).

ResultsMedian seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9 %) compared to all other assays ([&ge;]98.8 %) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8 %) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100 %).

341,"Changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain","BackgroundWe aimed to examine main changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19.

MethodsWe used prospective data from 3041 participants in four cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged [&ge;]65 years in Spain. Data were obtained using validated questionnaires through a pre-pandemic face-to-face interview and a telephone interview conducted between weeks 7 to 15 after the beginning the COVID-19 lockdown. Lineal or multinomial, as appropriate, regression models with adjustment for the main confounders were used to assess changes in the outcome variables from the pre-pandemic to the confinement period, and to identify their associated factors.

ResultsOn average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Several subgroups of individuals were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health decline with confinement: (i)-males (for physical activity and sedentariness), (ii)-those with greater social isolation (for diet, physical activity, mental health), (iii)-feelings of loneliness (for diet, sleep quality, mental health), (iv)-poor housing conditions (for diet, physical activity, TV viewing time), (v)-unhealthy sleep duration (for physical activity and sedentariness), and (vi-worse overall health or chronic morbidities (for physical activity, screen time, mental health). On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement.

ConclusionsThe lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 in Spain, which was one of the most restrictive in Europe, only led to minor average changes in health behaviors among older adults. However, mental health was moderately affected. If another lockdown were imposed on this or future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals with male sex, greater social isolation, poor housing conditions and chronic morbidities, because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions",Esther Garcia-Esquinas; Rosario Ortol; Iago Gine-Vazquez; Jose A Carnicero; Asier Manas; Elvira Lara; Alejandro Alvarez-Bustos; German Vicente-Rodriguez; Mercedes Sotos-Prieto; Beatriz Olaya; Francisco Jose Garcia-Garcia; Narcis Gusi; Jose R Banegas; Irene Rodriguez-Gomez; Ellen A Struijk; David Martinez-Gomez; Alberto Lana; Josep Maria Haro; Jose L Ayuso-Mateos; Leocadio Rodriguez-Manas; Ignacio Ara; Marta Miret; Fernando Rodriguez-Artalejo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251738,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251738,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
342,Transfer learning via multi-scale convolutional neural layers for human-virus protein-protein interaction prediction,"To predict interactions between human and viral proteins, we combine evolutionary sequence profile features with a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Our architecture outperforms various feature encodings-based machine learning and state-of-the-art prediction methods. As our main contribution, we introduce two types of transfer learning methods (i.e.,  frozen type and  fine-tuning type) that reliably predict interactions in a target human-virus domain based on training in a source human-virus domain, by retraining CNN layers. Our transfer learning strategies can effectively apply prior knowledge transfer from large source dataset/task to small target dataset/task to improve prediction performance. Finally, we utilize the  frozen type of transfer learning to predict human-SARS-CoV-2 PPIs, indicating that our predictions are topologically and functionally similar to experimentally known interactions.

343,A glycan gate controls opening of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded (down) to an exposed (up) state in order to bind the human ACE2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the up and down states have been obtained by cryoEM and cryoET, details of the RBD opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here, over 200 s of weighted ensemble (WE) simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD opening pathways. Together with biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408, and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein achieves a new high-water mark for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection.",Terra E Sztain; Surl-Hee Ahn; Anthony T.

344,A chicken IgY can efficiently inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the ACE2 binding domain in vitro,"COVID-19 pneumonia is spreading widely in the world now. Currently, no specific antiviral drugs have been developed. The vaccine is the most effective way to control the epidemic. Passive immune antibodies are also an effective method to prevent and cure COVID-19 pneumonia. We used SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD as an antigen to immunize layers in order to extract, separate and purify SARS-CoV-2-IgY from egg yolk. SARS-CoV-2-IgY(S-IgY) can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the Cells and reduce the viral load in cells. The EC50 of W3-IgY (S-IgY in the third week after immunization) is1.35 {+/-} 0.15nM. The EC50 of W9-IgY (S-IgYin the ninth week after immunization) is 2.76 {+/-} 1.54 nM. When the dose of S-IgY is 55 nM, the fluorescence representing intracellular viral protein is obviously weakenedin Immunofluorescence microscopy.

Results of Sars-CoV-2 /VeroE6 cell experiment confirmed that S-IgY had strong antiviral effecton SARS-Co-V-2, and its EC50 is 27.78 {+/-} 1.54nM vs 3259 {+/-} 159.62 nM of Redesivir (differ>106 times, P<0.001).

S-IgY can inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, which is related to its targeting the ACE2 binding domain.

S-IgY is safe, efficient, stable and easy to obtain. This antibody may have the potential to be an effective method for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

345,Characterization of humoral and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in people living with HIV,"There is an urgent need to understand the nature of immune responses generated against SARS-CoV-2, to better inform risk-mitigation strategies for people living with HIV (PLWH). Although not all PLWH are considered immunosuppressed, residual cellular immune deficiency and ongoing inflammation could influence COVID-19 disease severity, the evolution and durability of protective memory responses. Here, we performed an integrated analysis, characterizing the nature, breadth and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in PLWH, controlled on ART, and HIV negative subjects. Both groups were in the convalescent phase of predominately mild COVID-19 disease. The majority of PLWH mounted SARS-CoV-2 Spike- and Nucleoprotein-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, as measured by ELISpot, at levels comparable to HIV negative subjects. T cell responses against Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid were the most prominent, with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells outnumbering CD8 T cells. Notably, the overall magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses related to the size of the naive CD4 T cell pool and the CD4:CD8 ratio in PLWH, in whom disparate antibody and T cell responses were observed. Both humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 were detected at 5-7 months post-infection, providing evidence of medium-term durability of responses irrespective of HIV serostatus. Incomplete immune reconstitution on ART and a low CD4:CD8 ratio could, however, hamper the development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and serve as a useful tool for risk stratification of PLWH. These findings have implications for the individual management and potential effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PLWH.

Here, we examined the antibody immune competence of children and adolescents with prevalent inflammatory rheumatic diseases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE), against the seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 that frequently infects this age group. Despite immune dysfunction and immunosuppressive treatment, JIA, JDM and JSLE patients mounted comparable or stronger responses than healthier peers, dominated by IgG antibodies to HCoV-OC43 spike, and harboured IgG antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike. In contrast, responses to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins exhibited delayed age-dependent class-switching and were not elevated in JIA, JDM and JSLE patients, arguing against increased exposure.

347,Live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate: Protective immunity without serious lung lesions in Syrian hamsters,"Various COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trial. However, no live attenuated vaccine has been developed yet, despite their generally high efficacy. Here, we established temperature-sensitive mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2, whose growth was significantly slower than that of the parent strain at 37{degrees}C. One of the strains, A50-18, which presented mutations in nonstructural protein 14, did not replicate at all at 37{degrees}C in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that this strain replicated inefficiently in the lungs of Syrian hamsters, and intra-nasal inoculation induced sufficient anti-SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies to protect against wild type virus infection. These results suggest that the A50-18 strain could be a promising live attenuated vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

The high mortality rate was observed in patients who had pre-existing health conditions like cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cancer patients was not discovered yet at the pathway level. This study was about determining the common key genes of COVID-19 and lung cancer through network analysis. The hub genes associated with COVID-19 and lung cancer were identified through Protein-Protein interaction analysis. The hub genes are ALB, CXCL8, FGF2, IL6, INS, MMP2, MMP9, PTGS2, STAT3 and VEGFA.

350,"Single-Domain SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD Antibodies Isolated from Immunized Llama Effectively Bind Targets of the Wuhan, UK, and South African Strains in vitro","The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 variants has become a major challenge of the current fight against the pandemic. Of particular concerns are the strains that have arisen from the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa. The UK variant spreads rapidly and is projected to overtake the original strain in the US as early as in March 2021, while the South African variant appears to evade some effects of the current vaccines. Potential false-negative diagnosis using currently available antigen kits that may not recognize these variants could cause another wave of community infection. Therefore, it is imperative that antibodies used in the detection kits are validated for binding against these variants. Here we report that the nanoantibodies (nAbs in our terminology, also referred to as VHH fragments, single domain antibodies, nanobodies) that we have developed for rapid antigen detection test bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein from the original COVID-SARS-2 virus as well as those from the UK and South African variants.

351,The Host Interactome of Spike Expands the Tropism of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) and has rapidly created a global pandemic. Patients that survive may face a slow recovery with long lasting side effects that can afflict different organs. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial airway cells that express the host entry receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) which binds to spike protein trimers on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions. However, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other tissues even though they are negative for ACE2. To gain insight into the molecular constituents that might influence SARS-CoV-2 tropism, we determined which additional host factors engage with the viral spike protein in disease-relevant human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBEo-). We found that spike recruited the extracellular proteins laminin and thrombospondin and was retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) by the proteins DJB11 and FBX2 which support re-folding or degradation of nascent proteins in the ER. Because emerging mutations of the spike protein potentially impact the virus tropism, we compared the interactome of D614 spike with that of the rapidly spreading G614 mutated spike. More D614 than G614 spike associated with the proteins UGGT1, calnexin, HSP7A and GRP78/BiP which ensure glycosylation and folding of proteins in the ER. In contrast to G614 spike, D614 spike was endoproteolytically cleaved, and the N-terminal S1 domain was degraded in the ER even though C-terminal  S2 only proteoforms remained present. D614 spike also bound more laminin than G614 spike, which suggested that extracellular laminins may function as co-factor for an alternative,  S2 only dependent virus entry. Because the host interactome determines whether an infection is productive, we developed a novel proteome-based cell type set enrichment analysis (pCtSEA). With pCtSEA we determined that the host interactome of the spike protein may extend the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 beyond mucous epithelia to several different cell types, including macrophages and epithelial cells in the nephron. An  S2 only dependent, alternative infection of additional cell types with SARS-CoV-2 may impact vaccination strategies and may provide a molecular explanation for a severe or prolonged progression of disease in select COVID-19 patients.",Tom Casimir Bamberger; Sandra Pankow; Salvador Martinez-Bartolome; Jolene Diedrich; Robin Park; John Robert Yates III,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431318,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431318,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False
352,N-Terminal finger stabilizes the reversible feline drug GC376 in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro,"The main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CL protease) of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority drug target in the development of antivirals to combat COVID-19 infections. A feline coronavirus antiviral drug, GC376, has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and live virus growth. As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drugs properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drugs P1 position.

353,Endothelial cells elicit a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-COV-2 without productive viral infection,"Thrombotic and microvascular complications are frequently seen in deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting that vascular pathology is a major driver of severe disease. However, whether this is caused by direct viral infection of the endothelium or inflammation-induced endothelial activation remains highly contentious. What role the endothelium plays in viral amplification and inflammation thus remains a key unresolved question in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we use patient autopsy samples, primary human endothelial cells and an in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial cell barrier to show that primary human endothelial cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2, albeit at low levels. Accordingly, when present in a sufficiently high concentration, SARS-CoV-2 can enter primary human endothelial cells from either the apical or basolateral surface. Whilst inducing an inflammatory response, this is not a productive infection. We further demonstrate that in a co-culture model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier, endothelial cells are not infected with SARS-CoV-2. They do however, sense and respond to an infection in the adjacent epithelial cells, resulting in the induction of a pro-inflammatory response.

Taken together, these data suggest that in vivo, endothelial cells are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that infection is only likely to occur if the adjacent pulmonary epithelium is denuded (basolateral infection) or a high viral load is present in the blood (apical infection). In such a scenario, whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection of the endothelium can occur, it does not contribute to viral amplification. However, endothelial cells are still likely to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by sensing and mounting a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2.",Lilian Schimmel; Keng Yih Chew; Claudia Stocks; Teodor Yordanov; Tish Essebier; Arutha Kulasinghe; James Monkman; Anna Flavia Ribeiro dos Santos Miggiolaro; Lucia De Noronha; Anne K Lagendijk; Kate Schroder; Larisa Labzin; Emma J Gordon; Kirsty R Short,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431177,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431177,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False
354,"The impact of armed conflict on the epidemiological situation of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Libya, Syria, and Yemen.","BackgroundSince the Arab uprising 2011, Libya, Syria, and Yemen have gone through a major armed conflict. This resulted in a high rate of mortality, injury, and population displacement with a collapse of the health care system. Furthermore, it was complicated by the emergence of, COVID-19 as a global pandemic which made the population of these countries strive under unusual conditions to tackle both the pandemic and the ongoing wars. The objectives of this study were to determine the impacts and influence of armed conflicts on the epidemiology of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) within these war-torn countries and outline the needed strategies to combat the spread of the pandemic and its upcoming consequences.

MethodsThe official and public data regarding the dynamics of armed conflict and the spread, of SARS-COV-19 in Libya, Syria, and Yemen were collected from all available sources. Starting from the early emergence of the COVID-19 in each country until the end of December 2020. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques and the weekly resolved data were used to probe the link between the intensity levels of the armed conflict and the spread of the pandemic.

ResultsData indicated that there is an increase in the intensity of violence levels at an early stage from March to August reached up to two folds in the three countries particularly in Libya. In this violent period, few cases of COVID-19 were reported ranging from 5-53 cases/day. From September to December, a significant decline in the level of the armed conflict was accompanied by steep upsurges in the number of reported COVID-19 cases reached up to 500 cases/day. The highest accumulative cases of COVID-19 were reported in Libya, Syria, and Yemen respectively.

ConclusionsOur analysis demonstrates that the armed conflict has provided an opportunity for SARS-COV-19 to spread. At the early weeks of the pandemic that coincided with high levels of the armed conflict few cases were officially reported indicating a vast undercount, which may suggest a hidden mitigating spread at an early stage. Then the pandemic increased immensely as the armed conflict decline to reach the highest by December. A full-blown transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic in these countries is expected.

355,"Mortality from injury, overdose and suicide during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, March-July, 2020","Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with substantial rates of all-cause excess mortality. The contribution of external causes of death to excess mortality including drug overdose, homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries during the initial outbreak in the United States is less well documented.

MethodsUsing public data published by the National Center for Health Statistics on February 10, 2021, we measured monthly excess mortality (the gap between observed and expected deaths) from five external causes using national-level data published by National Center for Health Statistics; assault (homicide); intentional self-harm (suicide); accidents (unintentional injuries); and motor vehicle accidents. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) models developed with cause-specific monthly mortality counts and US population data from 2015-2019 and estimated the contribution of individual cause-specific mortality to all-cause excess mortality from March-July 2020.

ResultsFrom March-July, 2020, 212,825 (95% CI 136,236-290,776) all-cause excess deaths occurred in the US). There were 8,540 excess drug overdoses (all intents) (95% CI 5,106 to 11,975), accounting for 4% of all excess mortality; 1,455 excess homicide deaths (95% CI 708 to 2202, accounting for 0.7% of excess mortality; 5,492 excess deaths due to unintentional accidents occurred (95% CI 85 to 10,899, accounting for 2.6% of excess mortality. Though a non-significantly 135 (95% CI -1361 to 1,630) more MVA deaths were recorded during the study period, a significant decrease in April (525; 95% CI -817 to -233) and significant increases in June-July (965; 95% CI 348 to 1,587) were observed. Suicide deaths were statistically lower than projected by 2,067 (95% CI 941-3,193 fewer deaths).

MeaningExcess deaths from drug overdoses, homicide, and addicents occurred during the pandemic but represented a small fraction of all-cause excess mortality. The excess external causes of death, however, still represent thousands of lives lost. Notably, deaths from suicide were lower than expected and therefore did not contribute to excess mortality.",Jeremy Faust; Chengan Du; Katherine Mayes; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Michael L Barnett; Harlan M Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251682,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251682,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
356,Severe COVID-19 pneumonia and barotrauma: From the frying pan into the fire.,"AimCOVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS (C-ARDS) has a high mortality. Preliminary reports indicate a higher incidence of barotrauma in patients with C-ARDS[1] both on invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) This study examines the incidence and risk factors for barotrauma and change in outcomes after barotrauma in patients with severe C-ARDS on positive pressure respiratory support (PPRS).

Methods and materialsThis is a retrospective study of C-ARDS associated barotrauma over 5 months in patients on PPRS in a tertiary COVID care center. The type of barotrauma, intervention, related factors, such as type of respiratory support (iMV vs NIV), airway pressure prior to the occurrence of barotrauma, and post-barotrauma outcomes were analyzed.

ResultsA total of 38/410 (9.3%) C-ARDS patients on PPRS [mean age 57.82 {+/-} 13.3 years, 32 males (84.2%)] developed barotrauma. Of these, 20 patients (52.6%) were on NIV and 18 (47.4%) patients were iMV on standard recommended settings. The median P/F ratio of patients on MV at the time of barotrauma was 116.4 (IQR 72.4, 193.25). The details of barotrauma were as follows: 24 patients had pneumothorax (PTX), 2 had pneumo-mediastinum and 12 had subcutaneous emphysema. Overall, 24/38 (63.2%) patients, including 15/18 (83.3%) on MV succumbed to their illness. The barotrauma happened a median of 6.5 days (IQR 4.75,13) after admission and 15 days (IQR 10.25,18.0) from symptom onset. The median duration from barotrauma to death was 7 days (IQR 2.25, 8.0) and barotrauma to discharge (for survivors) was 12.5 days (IQR 8.0, 21.25). All patients received steroids and 11/38 (28.9%) received additional immunosuppression with tocilizumab.

ConclusionA high incidence of barotrauma was seen in this large series of severe C-ARDS patients on PPRS.

357,An analysis of school absences in England during the Covid-19 pandemic,"The introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, in the UK in early 2020, resulted in the UK government introducing several control policies in order to reduce the spread of disease. As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally all school children returned to the classroom in September. In this paper, we analyse the data on school absences from September 2020 to December 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Educational Settings database compiled by the Department for Education and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools.

Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers were seen to decline during the November lockdown, particularly in those regions that had previously been in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first two weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences owing to confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be significantly lower than in secondary schools across all regions and tiers.

In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and Greater London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in cases in secondary schools. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools in most regions, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. We conclude that there is not significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a significant role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.",Emma R Southall; Alex Holmes; Edward M Hill; Benjamin D Atkins; Trystan Leng; Robin N Thompson; Louise J Dyson; Matt J Keeling; Michael Tildesley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251484,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251484,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
358,Anterior nasal versus nasal mid-turbinate sampling for a SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test: does localisation or professional collection matter?,"ObjectivesThe aim of this diagnostic accuracy study was direct comparison of two different nasal sampling methods for an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) that detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the accuracy and feasibility of self-sampling was evaluated.

MethodsThis manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, compared professional anterior nasal (AN) and nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) sampling for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. A second group of participants collected a NMT sample themselves and underwent a professional nasopharyngeal swab for comparison. The reference standard was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sampling. Individuals with high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement were calculated. Self-sampling was observed without intervention. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires.

ResultsAmong 132 symptomatic adults, both professional AN- and NMT-sampling yielded a sensitivity of 86.1% (31/36 RT-PCR positives detected; 95%CI: 71.3-93.9) and a specificity of 100.0% (95%CI: 95.7-100). The positive percent agreement (PPA) was 100% (95%CI: 89.0-100). Among 96 additional adults, self NMT- and professional NP-sampling yielded an identical sensitivity of 91.2% (31/34; 95%CI 77.0-97.0). Specificity was 98.4% (95%CI: 91.4-99.9) with NMT- and 100.0% (95%CI: 94.2-100) with NP-sampling. The PPA was 96.8% (95%CI: 83.8-99.8). Most participants (85.3%) considered self-sampling as easy to perform.

ConclusionProfessional AN- and NMT-sampling are of equivalent accuracy for an Ag-RDT in ambulatory symptomatic adults. Participants were able to reliably perform the NMT-sampling themselves, following written and illustrated instructions. Nasal self-sampling will likely facilitate scaling of SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing.",Olga Nikolai; Chiara Rohardt; Frank Tobian; Andrea Junge; Victor M. Corman; Terry C.

359,SARS-CoV2- infection as a trigger of humoral response against apolipoprotein A-1,"AimsUnravelling autoimmune targets triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide crucial insights in the physiopathology of the disease and foster the development of potential therapeutic candidate targets and prognostic tools. We want to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 exposure could trigger a humoral response against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgG) through molecular mimicry and assess its relationship to patient prognosis.

Methods and ResultsAnti-Spike domain 1 (SD1) IgGs, anti-apoA-1 IgGs and against mimic peptides, as well as cytokines were assessed by immunoassays on a case-control (n=101), an intensive care unit (ICU; n=126) with a 28-days follow-up, and a general population cohort (n=663) with available samples in the pre and post-pandemic period. Linear sequence homologies and antibodies cross-reactivity between apoA-1, TLR2, and Spike epitopes were identified. Overall, anti-apoA-1 IgG levels were higher in COVID-19 patients or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals than in healthy donors or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals (p<0.0001). Significant and similar associations were noted between anti-apoA-1, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, cytokines, and lipid profile. In ICU patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-apoA-1 seroconversion rates displayed similar 7-days kinetics, reaching 82% for anti-apoA-1 seropositivity. C-statistics (CS) indicated that anti-Spike/TLR2 mimic-peptide IgGs displayed a significant prognostic accuracy for overall mortality at 28 days (CS: 0.64; p=0.02). In the general population, SARS-CoV-2 exposure increased baseline anti-apoA-1 IgG levels.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 induces a marked humoral response against the major protein of high-density lipoproteins. As a correlate of poorer prognosis in other clinical settings, such autoimmunity signatures may relate to long-term COVID-19 prognosis assessment and warrant further scrutiny in the current COVID-19 pandemic.",Sabrina Pagano; Sabine Yerly; Benjamin Meyer; Catherine Juillard; Noemie Suh; Christophe LeTerrier; Jean-Pierre Daguer; Lluc Farrera Soler; Sofia Barluenga; Giovanni Piumatti; Oliver Hartley; Barbara Lemaitre; Christiane Sigrid Eberhardt; Claire-Anne Siegrist; Isabella Eckerle; Silvia Stringhini; Idris Guessous; Laurent Kaiser; Jerome Pugin; Nicolas Winssinger; Nicolas Vuilleumier,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251298,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251298,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

361,Treatment of irritant contact dermatitis in healthcare settings during the COVID19 pandemic: The emollient Dermol 500 exhibits virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2.,"ObjectivesTo investigate whether the antimicrobial emollient Dermol 500 and its active components, benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorohexidine dihydrochloride (CD), exhibit virucidal activity thus informing whether Dermol 500 is a suitable soap substitute for use during the COVID19 pandemic, to combat the increased incidence of work-related contact dermatitis in clinical settings that we report here.

MethodsInactivation of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 by Dermol 500 and the independent and combined virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD was assessed by influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays. Viruses were treated with concentrations of BAK and CD comparable to Dermol 500, and lower, and infectivity of the viruses assessed by titration.

ResultsDermol 500 exhibits comparable virucidal activity to alcohol-based sanitisers against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD exhibit independent and synergistic virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID19.

ConclusionsThe synergistic virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD makes Dermol 500 suitable as a soap substitute to treat and prevent work-related contact dermatitis in healthcare settings.

362,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva samples in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases,"SARS-CoV-2 infections can be symptomatic as well as asymptomatic. In this study, we analyzed 460,814 saliva samples collected from July 2020 to January 2021 for a SARS-CoV-2-specific gene target using the FDA EUA test, CRL Rapid Response, based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We measured SARS-CoV-2 viral loads using cycle threshold (Ct) values. A total of 17,813 samples tested positive for COVID-19 using self-collected saliva samples. The Ct values ranged from 11 to 40, 91.3% distributed between 22 to 38 Ct. We then compared Ct values for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases for all positive saliva samples. A total of 8,706 cases were symptomatic with an average Ct value of 29.24, and 9,107 cases were asymptomatic with an average Ct value of 30.99.

363,A surrogate virus neutralization test to quantify antibody-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in finger stick dried blood spot samples,"BackgroundThe spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host cells, and neutralizing antibodies are effective at blocking this interaction to prevent infection. Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample.

MethodsSamples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV).

ResultsDilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991. Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability. Median % neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples.

ConclusionsLarge-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations.",Amelia Sancilio; Richard D'Aquila; ELIZABETH MCNALLY; Matt Velez; Michael Ison; Alexis R.

364,Ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection using exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose in a public health setting,"BackgroundRapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is crucial for taking timely measures and minimizing the risk of further SARS-CoV-2 spread. We aimed to assess the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) for the discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis was a prospective real-world study of individuals presenting to public test facility for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular amplification tests (TMA or RT-PCR). After sampling of a combined throat/nasopharyngeal swab, breath profiles were obtained using a cloud-connected eNose. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and ROC analysis. Data from the training set were tested in a validation, a replication and an asymptomatic set.

FindingsFor the analysis 4510 individuals were available. In the training set (35 individuals with; 869 without SARS-CoV-2), the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.947 (CI:0.928-0.967). These results were confirmed in the validation set (0.957; CI:0.942-0.971, n=904) and externally validated in the replication set (0.937; CI:0.926-0.947, n=1948) and the asymptomatic set (0.909; CI:0.879-0.938, n=754). Selecting a cut-off value of 0.30 in the training set resulted in a sensitivity/specificity of 100/78, >99/84, 98/82% in the validation, replication and asymptomatic set, respectively.

InterpretationeNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities and can be used as a screening test to define who needs an additional confirmation test.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSElectronic nose technology is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and infections.

As of Feb 13, 2021, our search of PubMed using keywords ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""eNose"" OR ""electronic nose"" OR ""exhaled breath analysis"" yielded 4 articles (1-4) that have assessed test characteristics of electronic nose to diagnose COVID-19. In these small studies the obtained signals using sensor-based technologies, two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry, provided adequate discrimination between patients with and without COVID-19.

Added value of this studyWe prospectively studied the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) to diagnose or rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with and without symptoms presenting to a public test facility. In the training set with 904 individuals, the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.948. In three independent validation cohorts of 3606 individuals in total, eNose was able to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in 70-75% of individuals, with a sensitivity ranging between 98-100%, and a specificity between 78-84%. No association was found between cycle thresholds values, as semi-quantitative measure of viral load, and eNose variables.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe available findings, including those from our study, support the use of eNose technology to distinguish between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy. Exhaled breath analysis by eNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities. The results can be made available within seconds and can therefore be used as screening instrument. The eNose can reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminating the need for additional time-consuming, stressful, and expensive diagnostic tests in the majority of individuals.",Rianne de Vries; Rene M.

365,Reinfection Rates among Patients who Previously Tested Positive for COVID-19: a Retrospective Cohort Study,"ObjectivesTo evaluate reinfection rates and protective effectiveness of prior disease among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in the United States.

DesignRetrospective cohort study

SettingOne multi-hospital health system in Ohio and Florida

ParticipantsAll 150,325 patients who were tested for COVID-19 infection via PCR from March 12, 2020 to August 30, 2020. Testing performed up to January 7, 2021 in these patients was included for analysis. Healthcare workers were excluded.

Main outcome measuresThe main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection [&ge;] 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protective effectiveness of prior infection.

ResultsOf 150,325 patients tested for COVID-19 prior to August 30, 8,845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141,480 (94.1%) tested negative. 974 (11%) of the positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 56 had possible reinfection. Of those, 26 (46.4 %) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 4,163 (12.9%) were subsequently positive and 2,460 of those (59.1%) were symptomatic. Protective effectiveness of prior infection was 78.5% (95% confidence interval 72.0 to 83.5), and against symptomatic infection was 83.1% (95% confidence interval 75.1 to 88.5). Protective effectiveness increased over time.

ConclusionsPrior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. Protective effectiveness increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection.

The objective of this study was to predict and specify the biological attributes of variation in age and gender-based on COVID-19 status (deceased/recovered).

MethodsIn this retrospective study, the data was extracted from a recognised web-based portal. A total of 112,860 patients record was filtered out and an additional 9,131 records were separately analyzed to examine age and gender relationship with patients COVID-19 status (recovered/deceased). Chi-square, t-test, binary logistic regression, and longitudinal regression analysis were conducted.

ResultsThe male COVID-19 cases (65.39%) were more than females (34.61%) and mean age of infected and recovered patients was 39.47{+/-}17.59 years and 36.85{+/-}18.51 years respectively. The odds for infection was significantly higher among females for lower age categories, which declines with age. The age-adjusted odds for recovery were significantly higher among females (O.R.=1.779) and odds for recovery was highest in 5-17 years age category (O.R.=88.286) independent of gender.

ConclusionThe chances of being COVID-19 infected was higher for females of lower age categories (<35 years) which decreases with age. The odds for recovery among females was significantly higher than males. The chances of recovery declines with increasing age and the variation could be attributed to the biological differences between age categories and gender.",Savitesh Kushwaha; Poonam Khanna; Vineeth Rajagopal; Tanvi Kiran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251681,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251681,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

369,Learning Where to Look for COVID-19 Growth: Multivariate Analysis of COVID-19 Cases Over Time using Explainable Convolution-LSTM,"Determinant factors which contribute to the prediction should take into account multivariate analysis for capturing coarse-to-fine contextual information. From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers, During summer, UV can inactivate viruses that live in the air and on the surface of the objects especially at noon in tropical or subtropical countries. However, it may not be significant in closed spaces like workspace and areas with the intensive human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas. Different COVID-19 pandemic growth patterns in northern subtropical, southern subtropical and tropical countries occur over time. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis via visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases.

Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7, the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2, each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately.

ResultsDue to the lack of publicly available pipelines, which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern, we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HaVoC (Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants Of Concern). HaVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

ConclusionsHaVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks. HaVoC is currently being used in Finland for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

372,In vitro efficacy of Artemisia extracts against SARS-CoV-2,Traditional medicines based on herbal extracts have been proposed as affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Teas and drinks containing extracts of Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra have been widely used in Africa in efforts to prevent and fight COVID-19 infections. We sought to study the ability of different A. annua and A. afra extracts and the Covid-Organics drink produced in Madagascar to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and feline coronavirus (FCoV) replication in vitro. Several extracts as well as Covid-Organics inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV replication at concentrations that did not affect cell viability. It remains unclear whether peak plasma concentrations in humans can reach levels needed to inhibit viral replication following consumption of teas or Covid-Organics. Clinical studies are required to evaluate the utility of these drinks for COVID-19 prevention or treatment in patients.,Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431122,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431122,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False
373,Direct activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is blocked by Simvastatin,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved with endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-{kappa}B and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not affect endothelial activation. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.",Yisong Qian; Tianhua Lei; Parth Patel; Chi Lee; Paula Monaghan-Nichols; Hong-Bo Xin; Jianming Qiu; Mingui Fu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431174,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431174,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False

UV light disinfection is a well-established method for inactivating respiratory viruses. Here, we have determined that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on multiple surfaces. For hard, non-porous surfaces we observed that SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated to undetectable levels on plastic and glass with a UV dose of 34.9 mJ/cm2 and stainless steel with a dose of 52.5 mJ/cm2. We also observed that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirator material to undetectable levels with a dose of 103 mJ/cm2. We included UV dosimeter cards that provide a colorimetric readout of UV dose and demonstrated their utility as a means to confirm desired levels of exposure were reached. Together, the results present here demonstrate that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is an effective technology for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on multiple surfaces.",Alexander S Jureka; Caroline G Williams; Christopher F Basler,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.431032,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.431032,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False
375,Jumper Enables Discontinuous Transcript Assembly in Coronaviruses,"Genes in SARS-CoV-2 and, more generally, in viruses in the order of Nidovirales are expressed by a process of discontinuous transcription mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This process is distinct from alternative splicing in eukaryotes, rendering current transcript assembly methods unsuitable to Nidovirales sequencing samples. Here, we introduce the DO_SCPLOWISCONTINUOUSC_SCPLOW TO_SCPLOWRANSCRIPTC_SCPLOW AO_SCPLOWSSEMBLYC_SCPLOW problem of finding transcripts [Formula] and their abundances c given an alignment [Formula] under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. Underpinning our approach is the concept of a segment graph, a directed acyclic graph that, distinct from the splice graph used to characterize alternative splicing, has a unique Hamiltonian path. We provide a compact characterization of solutions as subsets of non-overlapping edges in this graph, enabling the formulation of an efficient mixed integer linear program. We show using simulations that our method, JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW, drastically outperforms existing methods for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 samples, we find that JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW not only identifies canonical transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts expression of non-canonical transcripts that are well supported by direct evidence from long-read data, presence in multiple, independent samples or a conserved core sequence. JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes.

376,SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein enhances the infectivity of lentiviral spike particles,"The establishment of SARS CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral (LV) systems has enabled the rapid identification of entry inhibitors and neutralizing agents, alongside allowing for the study of this emerging pathogen in BSL-2 level facilities. While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that this augmentation by N renders LV spike particles less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Biochemical analysis revealed that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is achieved without a concomitant increase in sensitivity towards RBD binding-based neutralization. Our results hold important implications for the design and interpretation of similar LV pseudotyping-based studies.",Tarun Mishra; Sreepadmanabh M; Pavitra Ramdas; Amit Kumar Sahu; Atul Kumar; Ajit Chande,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430757,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430757,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False
377,SARS-CoV2 envelop proteins reshape the serological responses of COVID-19 patients,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has elicited a unique international mobilization of the scientific community to better understand this coronavirus and its associated disease and to develop efficient tools to combat infection. Similar to other coronavirae, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host cell complex secretory machinery to produce properly folded viral proteins that will compose the nascent virions; including Spike, Envelope and Membrane proteins, the most exposed membrane viral proteins to the host immune system. Antibody response is part of the anti-viral immune arsenal that infected patients develop to fight viral particles in the body. Herein, we investigate the immunogenic potential of Spike (S), Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) proteins using a human cell-based system to mimic membrane insertion and N-glycosylation. We show that both S and M proteins elicit the production of specific IgG, IgM and IgA in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Elevated Ig responses were observed in COVID+ patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. Finally, when SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614 and G614 variants were compared, reduced Ig binding was observed with the Spike G614 variant. Altogether, this study underlines the needs for including topological features in envelop proteins to better characterize the serological status of COVID+ patients, points towards an unexpected immune response against the M protein and shows that our assay could represent a powerful tool to test humoral responses against actively evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine effectiveness.",Sophie Martin; Christopher Heslan; Gwenaele Jegou; Leif A.

378,Recent and forecast post-COVID trends in hospital activity in England amongst 0 to 24 year olds: analyses using routine hospital administrative data,"BackgroundIncreasing hospital use in the past decade has placed considerable strain on children and young peoples (CYP) health services in England. Greater integration of healthcare may reduce these increases. We projected CYP healthcare activity out to 2040 and examined the potential impact of integrated care systems on projected activity.

MethodsWe used routine administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)) on emergency department (ED) attendances, emergency admissions and outpatient (OP) attendances for England by age-group for 0-24 year olds from 2007 to 2017. Bayesian projections of future activity used projected population and ethnicity and future child poverty rates. Cause data were used to identify ambulatory-care-sensitive-conditions (ACSC).

FindingsED attendances, emergency admissions and OP attendances increased in all age groups from 2007 to 2017. ED and OP attendances increased 60-80% amongst children under 10 years. ACSC and neonatal causes drove the majority of increases in emergency admissions. Activity was projected to increase by 2040 by 50-145% for ED attendances, 20-125% for OP attendances and 4-58% for total admissions. Scenarios of increasing or decreasing child poverty resulted in small changes to forecast activity. Scenarios in which 50% of ACSC were seen outside hospital in integrated care reduced estimated activity in 2040 by 21.2-25.9% for admissions and 23.5-30.1% for ED attendances across poverty scenarios amongst infants.

InterpretationThe rapid increases in CYP healthcare activity seen in the past decade may continue for the next decade given projected changes in population and child poverty, unless some of the drivers of increased activity are addressed. Contrary to these pessimistic scenarios, our findings suggest that development of integrated care for CYP at scale in England has the potential to dramatically reduce or even reverse these forecast increases

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere has been marked increases in hospital use (inpatient, outpatient and emergency department (ED)) by children and young people (CYP). Search of the PubMed database using the search terms: (((((""child""[MeSH Major Topic]) OR (""adolescent""[MeSH Major Topic])) OR (""infant""[MeSH Major Topic]))) AND ((healthcare use[Text Word])) OR (emergency admission[Text Word])) AND (united kingdom[Text Word]). Drivers of increased activity include population growth and sociodemographic factors, help-seeking behaviour, growth in medical knowledge and capability, and by factors within the health system. Additional factors in child health include increased survival of premature neonates and those with congenital conditions and rising parental expectations of modern medicine. Previous studies have shown that ambulatory-care-sensitive-conditions (ACSC) are responsible for much of the increase in CYP emergency activity in England and Scotland.

Added value of this studyThis is the first study to use existing data to project possible future scenarios for CYP healthcare activity out to 2030 and 2040 in any country. Our future scenarios are based upon authoritative projections for population, ethnic diversity and child poverty in England and allow us to estimate the potential impact of integrated care scenarios in which ACSC are treated outside hospital. We show that future projected CYP activity is very high if mitigations such as integrated care are not instituted in England.

Implications of all the available evidenceHealthcare activity has grown dramatically over the last decade in CYP, largely due to ACSC and the consequences of premature delivery. Projections to 2040 suggest that similar increases are likely over the next 2 decades without action to reduce child poverty and implementation of integrated care at scale in the NHS.",Joseph L Ward; Dougal Hargreaves; Marie Rogers; Alison Firth; Steve Turner; Russell M.

379,"Noncommunicable Diseases, Sociodemographic Vulnerability, and the Risk of Mortality in Hospitalized Children and Adolescents with COVID-19 in Brazil: A Syndemic in Play","BackgroundAlthough many studies identify the presence of comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes, few have addressed this issue in children. We aimed to study how these factors have impacted COVID-19 mortality in Brazilian children and adolescents.

MethodsThis is an observational study using publicly available data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We studied 5,857 patients younger than 20 years old, all of them hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models to study mortality, stratifying the analysis by age, region of the country, presence of noncommunicable diseases, ethnicity, and socioeconomic development.

FindingsIndividually, most of the comorbidities included were risk factors. Having more than one comorbidity increased almost tenfold the risk of death (OR 9{middle dot}67 95%CI 6{middle dot}89-13{middle dot}57). Compared to White children, Indigenous, Pardo (mixed), and East Asian had a significantly higher risk of mortality. We also found a regional effect (higher mortality in the North), and a socioeconomic effect (higher mortality among children from less socioeconomically developed municipalities).

InterpretationBesides the impact of comorbidities, we identified ethnic, regional, and socioeconomic effects shaping the mortality of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Brazil. Putting these findings together, we propose that there is a syndemic among COVID-19 and noncommunicable diseases, driven and fostered by large-scale sociodemographic inequalities. Facing COVID-19 in Brazil must also include addressing these structural issues. Our findings also identify risk groups among children that should be prioritized for public health measures, such as vaccination.

380,Associations between movement behaviors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"BackgroundThere is limited evidence about emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in Latin America.

ObjectiveTo assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the pandemic in Chile.

MethodsA cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1-to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the childs emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers.

ResultsIn total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9{+/-}1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were  more affectionate (78.9%),  more restless (65.1%), and  more frustrated (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors.

Over 500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected since December 2020, but its local establishment and pathways of spread are relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic testing data, we highlight the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US and locations of possible underreporting of B.1.1.7 cases. New York, which receives the most international travel from the UK, is likely one of the key hubs for introductions and domestic spread.

383,Association of demographic and occupational factors with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake in a multi-ethnic UK healthcare workforce: a rapid real-world analysis,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and adverse outcome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is now available for frontline UK HCWs; however, demographic/occupational associations with vaccine uptake in this cohort are unknown. We sought to establish these associations in a large UK hospital workforce.

MethodsWe conducted cross-sectional surveillance examining vaccine uptake amongst all staff at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. We examined proportions of vaccinated staff stratified by demographic factors, occupation and previous COVID-19 test results (serology/PCR) and used logistic regression to identify predictors of vaccination status after adjustment for confounders.

FindingsWe included 19,044 HCWs; 12,278 (64.5%) had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Compared to White HCWs (70.9% vaccinated), a significantly smaller proportion of ethnic minority HCWs were vaccinated (South Asian 58.5%, Black 36.8% p<0.001 for both). After adjustment, factors found to be negatively associated with vaccine uptake were; younger age, female sex, increasing deprivation and belonging to any non-White ethnic group (Black: aOR0.30, 95%CI 0.26-0.34, South Asian:0.67, 0.62-0.72). Those that had previously had confirmed COVID-19 (by PCR) were less likely to be vaccinated than those who had tested negative.

InterpretationEthnic minority HCWs and those from more deprived areas as well as younger, female staff are less likely to take up SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. These findings have major implications for the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes in HCWs and the wider population and should inform the national vaccination programme to prevent the disparities of the pandemic from widening.

384,"Population Age-Ineligible for COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States: Implications for State, County, and Race/Ethnicity Vaccination Targets","BackgroundWe examined the geographic and racial/ethnic distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine age-ineligible population (0-15 years old) in the U.S., and calculated the proportion of the age-eligible population that will need to be vaccinated in a given geo-demographic group in order to achieve either 60% or 75% vaccine coverage for that population as a whole.

MethodsUS Census Bureau population estimates for 2019 were used to calculate the percent vaccine ineligible and related measures for counties, states, and the nation as a whole. Vaccination targets for the 30 largest counties by population were calculated. Study measures were calculated for racial/ethnic populations at the national (n=7) and state (n=6) levels.

ResultsPercent of population ineligible for vaccine varied widely both geographically and by race/ethnicity. State values ranged from 15.8% in Vermont to 25.7% in Utah, while percent ineligible of the major racial/ethnic groups was 16.4% of non-Hispanic whites, 21.6% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and 27.5% of Hispanics. Achievement of total population vaccine coverage of at least 75% will require vaccinating more than 90% of the population aged 16 years and older in 29 out of 30 of the largest counties in the U.S.

ConclusionsThe vaccine-ineligibility of most children for the next 1-2 years, coupled with reported pervasive vaccine hesitancy among adults, especially women and most minorities, means that achievement of adequate levels of vaccine coverage will be very difficult for many vulnerable geographic areas and for several racial/ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanics, Blacks, and American Indians.",Elizabeth B Pathak; Janelle Menard; Rebecca B Garcia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251562,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251562,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
385,Impacts of school closures on physical and mental health of children and young people: a systematic review,"BackgroundThe well-documented links between education and health mean that school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be associated with significant health harms to children and young people (CYP). A systematic review of the evidence is needed to inform policy decisions around school closures and re-openings during the pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook a high-quality systematic review of observational quantitative studies (published or preprint) of the impacts of school closures (for any reason) on the health, wellbeing and educational outcomes of CYP, excluding impacts of closure on transmission of infection (PROSPERO CRD42020181658). We used a machine learning approach for screening articles, with decisions on inclusion and data extraction performed independently by 2 researchers. Quality was assessed for study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken as data did not allow meta-analysis.

Results16,817 records were screened, of which 151 were reviewed in full-text and 72 studies were included from 20 countries. 33% were cohort studies using historical control periods; 19% pre-post studies; and 46% cross-sectional studies which assessed change by comparison with population reference data. 63% were high-quality, 25% medium-quality and 13% low-quality. Cause of closure in all studies was the first COVID-19 pandemic wave with the exception of 5 influenza studies and 1 teacher strike.

27 studies concerning mental health identified considerable impacts across emotional, behavioural and restlessness/inattention problems; 18-60% of CYP scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms. Two studies reported non-significant rises in suicide rates. Self-harm and psychiatric attendances were markedly reduced, indicating a rise in unmet mental health need. Child protection referrals fell 27-39%, with a halving of the expected number of referrals originating in schools.

19 studies concerning health service use showed marked reductions in emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions, with evidence of delayed presentations and potential widening of inequalities in vaccination coverage. Data suggested marked rises in screen-time and social media use and reductions in physical activity however data on sleep and diet were inconclusive. Available data suggested likely higher harms in CYP from more deprived populations.

ConclusionsSchool closures as part of broader social distancing measures are associated with considerable harms to CYP health and wellbeing. Available data are short-term and longer-term harms are likely to be magnified by further school closures. Data are urgently needed on longer-term impacts using strong research designs, particularly amongst vulnerable groups.

386,The Missing Science: Epidemiological data gaps for COVID-19 policy in the United States,"We report on a scoping study of COVID-19 epidemiological data available for COVID-19 policy and management decisions for U.S. settings. We synthesize current US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates for parameter of infectious transmission, infection severity, and disease burden, and summarize epidemiologic contributions to these parameters published by CDC-affiliated investigators through Oct 30, 2020. Authoritative estimates of most infectious transmission and infection severity parameters exist but rely primarily on data from studies conducted in non-U.S. populations. Estimates of secondary infection risks for household, workplace, school, or other community settings are lacking and estimates of the clinical fraction remain uncertain. The CDC reports multiple disease incidence and prevalence measures at national and state geographies, including some measures disaggregated by age group, race/ethnicity and sex; however, nationally uniform disease burden measures are not available at the sub-state level or for sub-populations defined by exposure setting, limiting opportunities for targeted interventions. CDC-affiliated investigators authored 133 quantitative studies on COVID-19 through Oct 30, 2020; however only 34 employed analytic methods. The remainder were descriptive. Of the 34 analytic studies, eleven reported on risk factors for infection, seven reported on risk factors for severe disease, three on symptomatic infections, three reported secondary infection risks, and four reported on indirect pandemic effects. Gaps remain in the epidemiological data required for an efficient and equitable public health policy response to COVID-19.

387,'Leading from the front implementation strategies increase the success of influenza vaccination drives among healthcare workers: A reanalysis of Systematic Review evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA),"BackgroundSeasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is widely recommended to protect staff and patients. A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that  substantial heterogeneity remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity.

MethodsWe used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically analyse associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions.

ResultsIn Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of  leading from the front rather than  top-down implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions  dont-go-in-cold with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. Reapplying the  leading from the front theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns.

ConclusionsRegardless of intervention type a  leading from the front approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success. While the results pertain to flu vaccination among HCWs, the components identified here may be relevant to public health campaigns regarding COVID-19 vaccination.",Katy Sutcliffe; Dylan Kneale; James Thomas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251475,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251475,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
388,Evaluating COVID-19 reporting data in the context of testing strategies across 31 LMICs,"0.1. BackgroundCOVID-19 case counts are the predominant measure used to track epidemiological dynamics and inform policy decision-making. Case counts, however, are influenced by testing rates and strategies, which have varied over time and space. A method to consistently interpret COVID-19 case counts in the context of other surveillance data is needed, especially for data-limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

0.2. MethodsWe leverage statistical analyses to detect changes in COVID-19 surveillance data. We apply the pruned exact linear time change detection method for COVID-19 case counts, number of tests, and test positivity rate over time. With this information, we categorize change points as likely driven by epidemiological dynamics or non-epidemiological influences such as noise.

0.3. FindingsHigher rates of epidemiological change detection are more associated with open testing policies than with higher testing rates. The non-pharmaceutical intervention most correlated with epidemiological change is workplace closing. LMICs have the testing capacity to measure prevalence with precision if they use randomized testing. Rwanda stands out as a country with an efficient COVID-19 surveillance system. Sub-national data reveal heterogeneity in epidemiological dynamics and surveillance.

0.4. InterpretationRelying solely on case counts to interpret pandemic dynamics has important limitations. Normalizing counts by testing rate mitigates some of these limitations, and open testing policy is key to efficient surveillance. Our findings can be leveraged by public health officials to strengthen COVID-19 surveillance and support programmatic decision-making.

0.5. FundingThis publication is based on models and data analysis performed by the Institute for Disease Modeling at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched for articles on the current practices, challenges, and proposals for COVID-19 surveillance in LMICs. We used Google Scholar with search terms including ""COVID surveillance."" Existing studies were found to be qualitative, anecdotal, or highly location-specific.

Added value of this studyWe developed a quantitative method that makes use of limited information available from LMICs. Our approach improves interpretation of epidemiological data and enables evaluation of COVID-19 surveillance dynamics across countries.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results demonstrate the importance of open testing for strong surveillance systems, bolstering existing anecdotal evidence. We show strong alignment across LMICs between workplace restrictions and epidemiological changes. We demonstrate the importance of considering sub-national heterogeneity of epidemiological dynamics and surveillance.

389,Identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients using machine learning,"The current COVID-19 public health crisis, caused by SARSCoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has produced a devastating toll both in terms of human life loss and economic disruption. In this paper we present a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying whether a given patient (actually infected or suspected to be infected) is more likely to survive than to die, or vice-versa. We train this algorithm with historical data, including medical history, demographic data, as well as COVID-19-related information. This is extracted from a database of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in Mexico, constituting the official COVID-19 data compiled and made publicly available by the Mexican Federal Government. We demonstrate that the proposed method can detect high-risk patients with high accuracy, in each of four identified treatment stages, thus improving hospital capacity planning and timely treatment. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to provide optimal estimators for hypothesis-testing techniques commonly-used in biological and medical statistics. We believe that our work could be of use in the context of the current pandemic in assisting medical professionals with real-time assessments so as to determine health care priorities.",Mario A.

390,The global distribution of COVID-19 vaccine: The role of macro-socioeconomics measures,"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has continued to spread globally, many countries have progressed clinical trials and started vaccinations at the end of December 2020. This report aims to analyze the association of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and two macro-socioeconomics measures, including human development index (HDI) and Gross domestic product (GDP), among 25 countries till the first week of February 2021. Our results indicate that a higher GDP per Capita is positively associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine distribution. However, UAE and Israel have more successful vaccine distribution outcomes regardless of their GDP. In addition, the result shows HDI does not have a significant relationship with vaccine distribution. Although these macro-socioeconomic measures may be counted as a vital indicator for vaccine distribution, other factors may play roles in vaccine distribution, including well-developed health infrastructure, a centralized political system, and population size.",Ali Roghani; Samin Panahi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251436,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251436,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
391,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and symptoms in an Irish Healthcare Worker (HCW) setting: Results of the COVID Antibody Staff Testing (CAST) Study,"ObjectivesThis study examined the natural history, including incidence and prevalence, of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies serially up to 6 months post infection in Irish Healthcare Workers (HCWs) at an academic tertiary maternity hospital, during the first pandemic peak from March to September 2020.

DesignThis single centre observational study profiled SARS-CoV-2 incidence and infection using viral RNA detected using oro/nasopharyngeal swabs accompanied by serological assessment of study participants for the presence of S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participant demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 three gene target 2019-nCoV assay (SeeGene Inc., Rep. of Korea) or the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, USA). Blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance evaluation. Two other testing methods were also used; the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay (EuroImmun) and the Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 75 kit on the Architect i2000SR instrument (Abbott Laboratories).

SettingAcademic Tertiary Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland.

ParticipantsWe invited symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers employed at the Rotunda Maternity Hospital to participate in the CAST study.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe CAST study aimed to examine incidence and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs and to determine the presence and longevity of antibodies in this group. We also sought to examine the clinical utility of the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) and to compare it to the current ""accepted"" gold standard platform in Ireland.

ResultsBy July 2020, 398 molecular tests had been completed on symptomatic staff with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this cohort, 14% (n=54/398) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. The CAST study enrolled 137 HCWs with 86 participants symptomatic at time of swab collection and a further 51 asymptomatic control participants. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 52% (n=45/86) symptomatic study participants and serological positivity was confirmed in 98% (n=44/45) of those participants. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was detected in 4% (n=2/51) of control participants with a seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (n=4/51). We demonstrated that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants have detectable levels of antibodies at 100 days post infection, which persisted in 91% of participants at day 160+. Ongoing symptoms up to six months post infection were present in 50% of study participants with positive PCR and serology results. These data will be important to consider for long-term workforce planning in a healthcare setting, as the ongoing pandemic continues.

392,"Risk Perceptions, Knowledge and Behaviors of General and High-Risk Adult Populations towards COVID-19: A Systematic Scoping Review","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a major crisis for governments and populations around the globe. A large number of studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards the disease. The publics risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors are key factors that play a vital role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Our scoping review aims to map the early evidence on risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors of general and high-risk adult populations towards COVID-19.

MethodsA systematic scoping review was conducted of peer-reviewed articles in five databases (MEDLINE-Ovid, EMBASE-Ovid, PsycINFO-Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL-EBSCO) on studies conducted during the early stage of COVID-19 (January to June, 2020). The gray literature was also searched through Open Grey, Scopus, Wonder, Social Science Research Network, MedRxiv, and websites of major public health organizations. Twenty studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included, appraised and analyzed.

ResultsDuring the early stage of the pandemic, levels of risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 were moderate to high in both general and high-risk adult populations. The perceived severity of the disease was slightly higher than the perceived susceptibility of getting COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19. Adults were knowledgeable about preventive behaviors, including hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing, and avoidance behaviors. Nevertheless, an important knowledge gap regarding the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 was reported in many studies. Our review identified hand-washing and avoiding crowded places as dominant preventive behaviors at the early stage of the pandemic. Staying at home, reducing social contacts, and avoiding public transport were less widespread in general populations than in high-risk adult groups. Being a female, older, and more educated was associated with better knowledge of COVID-19 and appropriate preventive behaviors.

ConclusionThis scoping review offers a first understanding of general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should be undertaken to assess psychological and behavioral responses over time. Research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19.

Contribution to the field statementSince the beginning of the pandemic, a large number of primary studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards COVID-19. Nevertheless, no review has mapped the early evidence on the perceptions, knowledge, and preventive behaviors of adult populations towards the transmission of this new disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scoping review that offers an understanding of the general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors (RPKB) towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also identified sociodemographic factors associated with adults RPKB regarding COVID-19. As the virus does not affect individuals equally, knowing these factors can help to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 in certain population groups by developing targeted communication strategies that will facilitate their engagement in preventive measures. Finally, research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and RPKB towards COVID-19. The existence of a disproportionate number of COVID-19 fatalities within Black populations should signal the possible gaps in RPKB towards COVID-19 in these communities. Additional studies on ethnic health disparities can help public health authorities to introduce targeted actions towards these communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",nathalie clavel; Janine Badr; Lara Gautier; Melanie Lavoie-Tremblay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250257,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250257,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
393,Development of a new Aerosol Barrier Mask for mitigation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge impact on public health and significantly changed our lifestyle. This is due to the fast airborne oro-nasal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected individuals. The generation of liquid aerosolized particles occurs when the COVID-19 patients speak, sing, cough, sneeze, or simply breathe. We have developed a novel aerosol barrier mask (ABM) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens. This Aerosol Barrier Mask is designed for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission while transporting patients within hospital facilities. This mask can constrain aerosol and droplet particles and trap them in a biofilter, while the patient is normally breathing and administrated with medical oxygen. The system can be characterized as an oxygen delivery and mitigation mask which has no unfiltered exhaled air dispersion.

394,CLINICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE CALL SCORE FOR THE PREDICTION OF ADMISSION TO ICU AND DEATH IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA IN A REFERENCE HOSPITAL IN PERU,"ObjectiveDetermine the CALL SCOREs diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of ICU admission and death in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in a reference hospital in Peru.

MethodsWe performed an analytical cross-sectional observational study. We included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated at the ""Dos de Mayo"" National Hospital. Patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis confirmed by rapid or molecular testing were included. Those with an incomplete, illegible, or missing medical history and/or bacterial or fungal pneumonia were excluded. Data were extracted from medical records. The primary outcomes were mortality and admission to the ICU. The Call Score was calculated for each patient (4 to 13 points) and classified into three risk groups. Summary measures were presented for qualitative and quantitative variables. The area under the model curve and the operational characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated for the best cut-off point.

ResultsThe Call Score reported an area under the curve of 0.59 (IC95%: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43 for predicting death. However, for a cut-off point of 5.5, a sensitivity of 87%and a specificity of 65%were obtained. The area under the curve for ICU admission was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43; the 5.5 cut-off point showed a sensitivity of 82%and a specificity of 51%.

395,Outcomes of COVID-19 among Patients with End Stage Renal Disease on Remdesivir,"BACKGROUNDSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread use of remdesivir in adults and children. There is little known information about its outcomes in patients with severe renal dysfunction or end-stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis.

METHODSA retrospective, multicenter study was conducted on patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis that were discharged after treatment for COVID-19 between April 1st and December 31st, 2020. Primary endpoints were the length of stay, mortality, maximum oxygen requirements along with the escalation of care needing mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints included change in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition.

RESULTSA total of 52 charts were reviewed, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. 14 patients received remdesivir, and 14 patients did not receive remdesivir. The majority of patients were caucasian, female, with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The mean age was 65.33 +14.14 years. All the patients in the remdesivir group received dexamethasone as compared to only 30% of patients in the non-remdesivir group. There was no significant difference in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition between the two groups. Approximately 35% of the patients died, 18% required intensive ventilation, and the mean length of stay was 12.21 days.

DISCUSSIONThe study demonstrated no clinically significant difference in length of stay, maximum oxygen requirements, or mortality in COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease in the remdesivir group as compared to the non-remdesivir group.

396,Returning to nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences and needs of re-entering nurses,"AimAssessing the needs and experiences of re-entering nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands, thousands of former nurses have returned to nursing to support healthcare staff. After a period of absence and with little time to prepare, these former nurses re-entered during a challenging, uncertain and rapidly evolving pandemic. Little is known about the experiences and needs of these re-entering nurses.

DesignQualitative study

MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 purposively selected nurses who had re-entered nursing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed via thematic content analysis. This study followed the COREQ guidelines.

ResultsParticipants mentioned that a lack of a clear job description led to unclarity about the kind of tasks that re-entering nurses were expected and allowed to perform. This unclarity was especially notable in the newly established COVID-19 departments. Re-entering nurses mentioned to wish for an easily accessible mentorship structure and an individualised and practical training program. Re-entering nurses felt supported by a positive team dynamic, which was shaped by the sense of urgency and relevance of their work and helped them deal with stressful experiences.

ConclusionThe results indicate that a rapid and safe return to nursing during a pandemic could be facilitated by: a clear description of roles and responsibilities; an individualised assessment determining the competences and knowledge disparities of re-entering nurses; practical training focussing on competencies needed during a pandemic; and a collaborative mentorship structure to guide re-entering nurses.

Relevance to clinical practiceThe rapid recruitment of former nurses to mitigate an acute shortage of qualified nurses could play a vital role during a pandemic. To deploy these nurses effectively, safely and sustainably, it is important to address the needs of these re-entering nurses.

What does this paper contribute towards the wider global clinical community?O_LIThis research showed the need to prepare a flexible individualised training programme which could support re-entering nurses during crisis situations, such as a pandemic.

397,Evaluation of Facial Protection Against Close-Contact Droplet Transmission,"BackgroundFace shields are used as an alternative to facemasks, but their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. The goal of this study is to compare the performance of face shields, surgical facemasks, and cloth facemasks for mitigation of droplet transmission during close contact conditions.

MethodsA novel test system was developed to simulate droplet transmission during close contact conditions using two breathing headforms (transmitter and receiver) placed 4 feet apart with one producing droplets containing a DNA marker. Sampling coupons were placed throughout the test setup and subsequently analyzed for presence of DNA marker using quantitative PCR.

ResultsAll PPE donned on the transmitter headform provided a significant reduction in transmission of DNA marker to the receiver headform: cloth facemask (78.5%), surgical facemask (89.4%), and face shield (96.1%). All PPE resulted in increased contamination of the eye region of the transmitter headform (9,525.4% average for facemasks and 765.8% for the face shield). Only the face shield increased contamination of the neck region (207.4%), with the cloth facemask and surgical facemask resulting in reductions of 85.9% and 90.2%, respectively.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates face shields can provide similar levels of protection against direct droplet exposure compared to surgical and cloth masks. However, all PPE tested resulted in release of particles that contaminated surfaces. Contamination caused by deflection of the users exhalation prompts concerns for contact transmission via surfaces in exhalation flow path (e.g., face, eyeglasses, etc.).",Thomas B Stephenson; Courtney Cumberland; Geoff Kibble; Christopher Church; Sheila Nogueira-Prewitt; Sebastian MacNamara; Delbert A Harnish; Brian K Heimbuch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251443,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251443,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True

Long term use of spectacles may prevent repeated touching and rubbing of the eyes. Aim of the study is to compare the risk of COVID-19 in long term spectacles wearers with the risk in persons not using spectacles.

ObjectivesTo know the association between infection with SARSCoV-2 and wearing of spectacles.

Materials and methodsIn this study, 304 patients of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were selected. Their spectacles wearing behaviour was assessed through a questionnaire. Spectacles wearing behaviour of general population was obtained from older studies (for comparison). Risk of COVID-19 was calculated in long term spectacles wearers as well as in persons not using spectacles. Chi-Square test was used for statistical analysis.

ResultsIn this study, total 58 patients showed the behavior of using spectacles continuously during day time and always on outdoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 was found 0.48 in spectacles wearing population as compared to 1.35 in population not using spectacles. The calculated risk ratio was 0.36. The protective effectiveness of the spectacles was found statistically significant (p-value .00113).

399,Deep learning models for COVID-19 chest x-ray classification: Preventing shortcut learning using feature disentanglement,"In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, recent research has proposed creating deep learning based models that use chest radiographs (CXRs) in a variety of clinical tasks to help manage the crisis. However, the size of existing datasets of CXRs from COVID-19+ patients are relatively small, and researchers often pool CXR data from multiple sources, for example, using different x-ray machines in various patient populations under different clinical scenarios. Deep learning models trained on such datasets have been shown to overfit to erroneous features instead of learning pulmonary characteristics - a phenomenon known as shortcut learning. We propose adding feature disentanglement to the training process, forcing the models to identify pulmonary features from the images while penalizing them for learning features that can discriminate between the original datasets that the images come from. We find that models trained in this way indeed have better generalization performance on unseen data; in the best case we found that it improved AUC by 0.13 on held out data. We further find that this outperforms masking out non-lung parts of the CXRs and performing histogram equalization, both of which are recently proposed methods for removing biases in CXR datasets.",Caleb Robinson; Anusua Trivedi; Marian Blazes; Anthony Ortiz; Jocelyn Desbiens; Sunil Gupta; Rahul Dodhia; Pavan K Bhatraju; W.

There is an urgent need for antivirals targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to fight the current COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) represents a promising target for antiviral therapy. The lack of selectivity for some of the reported 3CLpro inhibitors, specifically versus cathepsin L, raises potential safety and efficacy concerns. ALG-097111 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (IC50 = 7 nM) without affecting the activity of human cathepsin L (IC50 > 10 M). When ALG-097111 was dosed in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2, a robust and significant 3.5 log10 (RNA copies/mg) reduction of the viral RNA copies and 3.7 log10 (TCID50/mg) reduction in the infectious virus titers in the lungs was observed. These results provide the first in vivo validation for the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as a promising therapeutic target for selective small molecule inhibitors.",Koen Vandyck; Rana Abdelnabi; Kusum Gupta; Dirk Jochmans; Andreas Jekle; Jerome Deval; Dinah Misner; Dorothée Bardiot; Caroline S.

401,"Potent, Novel SARS-CoV-2 PLpro Inhibitors Block Viral Replication in Monkey and Human Cell Cultures","Antiviral agents blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication are desperately needed to complement vaccination to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors. A high-throughput screen of biased and unbiased libraries gave a low hit rate, identifying only CPI-169 and the positive control, GRL0617, as inhibitors with good potency (IC50 < 10 {micro}M). Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however, without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series, we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design, obtaining several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors were obtained, culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by newly identified ligand interactions with a ""BL2 groove"" that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however, until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity. In this study, we report that novel PLpro inhibitors have excellent antiviral efficacy and potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures. Together, our data provide structural insights into the design of potent PLpro inhibitors and the first validation that non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can block infection of human cells with low micromolar potency.",Zhengnan Shen; Kiira Ratia; Laura Cooper; Deyu Kong; Hyun Lee; Youngjin Kwon; Yangfeng Li; Saad Alqarni; Fei Huang; Oleksii Dubrovskyi; Lijun Rong; Gregory RJ Thatcher; RUI XIONG,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.431008,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.431008,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False
402,Mutation N501Y in RBD of Spike Protein Strengthens the Interaction between COVID-19 and its Receptor ACE2,"SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world for the past year. Enormous efforts have been taken to understand its mechanism of transmission. It is well established now that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its first step of entry. Being a single-stranded RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving rapidly. Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, with a key mutation N501Y on the RBD, appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand its mechanism, we combined cell surface binding assay, kinetics study, single-molecule technique, and computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction characterized from all these methodologies, while the other two mutations from B.1.351 contributed to a less effect. Fluorescence-activated cell scan (FACS) assays found that RBD N501Y mutations are of higher binding affinity to ACE2 than the wild type. Surface plasmon resonance further indicated that N501Y mutation had a faster association rate and slower dissociation rate. Consistent with the kinetics study, atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force microscopy quantify their strength on living cells, showing a higher binding probability and unbinding force for the mutation. Finally, Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations on the dissociation of RBD-ACE2 complexes revealed that the N501Y introduced additional {pi}-{pi} and {pi}-cation interaction for the higher force/interaction. Taken together, we suggested that the reinforced interaction from N501Y mutation in RBD should play an essential role in the higher transmission of COVID-19 variants.",Fang Tian; Bei Tong; Liang Sun; Shengchao Shi; Bin Zheng; Zibin Wang; Xianchi Dong; Peng Zheng,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431117,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431117,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False

404,"A Comparative Analysis of COVID-19 Physical Distancing Policies in Botswana, India, Jamaica, Mozambique, Namibia, Ukraine, and the United States","BackgroundUnderstanding the differences in timing and composition of physical distancing policies is important to evaluate the early global response to COVID-19. A physical distancing intensity framework comprising 16 domains was recently published to compare physical distancing approaches between U.S. States. We applied this framework to a diverse set of low and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Botswana, India, Jamaica, Mozambique, Namibia, and Ukraine) to test the appropriateness of this framework in the global context and to compare the policy responses in this set of LMICs and with a sample of U.S. States during the first 100-days of the epidemic.

ResultsAll six of the LMICs in our sample adopted wide ranging physical distancing policies. The highest peak daily physical distancing intensity in each country was: Botswana (4.60); India (4.40); Ukraine (4.40); Namibia (4.20); and Jamaica (3.80). The number of days each country stayed at peak intensity ranged from 12-days (Jamaica) to more than 67-days (Mozambique). We found some key similarities and differences, including substantial differences in whether and how countries expressly required certain groups to stay at home. We also found that the LMICs generally implemented physical distancing policies when there were few confirmed cases and the easing of physical distancing policies did not discernably correlate with change in COVID-19 incidence. The physical distancing responses in the LMIC sample were generally more intense than in a sample of U.S. States, but results vary depending on the U.S. State. For example, California had a peak intensity of 4.29, which would place California below the peak intensity for Botswana, India, and Ukraine but above Mozambique, Namibia and Jamaica. The U.S. State of Georgia had a peak intensity of 3.07, which would place it lower than all of the LMICs in this sample. The peak intensity for the U.S. 12-state average was 3.84, which would place it lower than every LMIC in this sample except Jamaica.

406,"A genetically-informed study disentangling the relationships between tobacco smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, substance use disorders and respiratory infections, including COVID-19","BackgroundObservational studies suggest smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, and substance use disorders (SUDs) may play a role in the susceptibility for respiratory infections and disease, including coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019). However, causal inference is challenging due to comorbid substance use.

MethodsUsing genome-wide association study data of European ancestry (data from >1.7 million individuals), we performed single-variable and multivariable Mendelian randomization to evaluate relationships between smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, SUDs, and respiratory infections.

ResultsGenetically predicted lifetime smoking was found to be associated with increased risk for hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR)=4.039, 95% CI 2.335-6.985, P-value=5.93x10-7) and very severe hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=3.091, 95% CI, 1.883-5.092, P-value=8.40x10-6). Genetically predicted lifetime smoking was also associated with increased risk pneumoniae (OR=1.589, 95% CI, 1.214-2.078, P-value=7.33x10-4), lower respiratory infections (OR=2.303, 95% CI, 1.713-3.097, P-value=3.40x10-8), and several others. Genetically predicted cannabis use disorder (CUD) was associated with increased bronchitis risk (OR=1.078, 95% CI, 1.020-1.128, P-value=0.007).

ConclusionsWe provide strong genetic evidence showing smoking increases the risk for respiratory infections and diseases even after accounting for other substance use and abuse.

Furthermore, patients with severe liver disease have been shown to have higher mortality. Overall, the mechanism behind the liver injury remains unclear.

Approach and resultsWe showed that intra-hepatic bile duct cells could be grown using a human liver organoid platform. The cholangiocytes were not only susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, they also supported efficient viral replication. We also showed that SARS-CoV-2 replication was much higher than SARS-CoV.

409,"Integrated plasma proteomic and single-cell immune signaling network signatures demarcate mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19","The biological determinants of the wide spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations are not fully understood. Here, over 1400 plasma proteins and 2600 single-cell immune features comprising cell phenotype, basal signaling activity, and signaling responses to inflammatory ligands were assessed in peripheral blood from patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, at the time of diagnosis. Using an integrated computational approach to analyze the combined plasma and single-cell proteomic data, we identified and independently validated a multivariate model classifying COVID-19 severity (multi-class AUCtraining = 0.799, p-value = 4.2e-6; multi-class AUCvalidation = 0.773, p-value = 7.7e-6). Features of this high-dimensional model recapitulated recent COVID-19 related observations of immune perturbations, and revealed novel biological signatures of severity, including the mobilization of elements of the renin-angiotensin system and primary hemostasis, as well as dysregulation of JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and NF-{kappa}B immune signaling networks. These results provide a set of early determinants of COVID-19 severity that may point to therapeutic targets for the prevention of COVID-19 progression.

SummaryFeyaerts et al. demonstrate that an integrated analysis of plasma and single-cell proteomics differentiates COVID-19 severity and reveals severity-specific biological signatures associated with the dysregulation of the JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and NF-{kappa}B immune signaling networks and the mobilization of the renin-angiotensin and hemostasis systems.",Dorien Feyaerts; Julien Hedou; Joshua Gillard; Han Chen; Eileen S Tsai; Laura S Peterson; Kazuo Ando; Monali Manohar; Evan Do; Gopal K.R.

410,A single-cell atlas of lymphocyte adaptive immune repertoires and transcriptomes reveals age-related differences in convalescent COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 disease outcome is highly dependent on adaptive immunity from T and B lymphocytes, which play a critical role in the control, clearance and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is limited knowledge on the composition of the T and B cell immune receptor repertoires [T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs)] and transcriptomes in convalescent COVID-19 patients of different age groups. Here, we utilize single-cell sequencing (scSeq) of lymphocyte immune repertoires and transcriptomes to quantitatively profile the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients of varying age. We discovered highly expanded T and B cells in multiple patients, with the most expanded clonotypes coming from the effector CD8+ T cell population. Highly expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones show elevated markers of cytotoxicity (CD8: PRF1, GZMH, GNLY; CD4: GZMA), whereas clonally expanded B cells show markers of transition into the plasma cell state and activation across patients. By comparing young and old convalescent COVID-19 patients (mean ages = 31 and 66.8 years, respectively), we found that clonally expanded B cells in young patients were predominantly of the IgA isotype and their BCRs had incurred higher levels of somatic hypermutation than elderly patients. In conclusion, our scSeq analysis defines the adaptive immune repertoire and transcriptome in convalescent COVID-19 patients and shows important age-related differences implicated in immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",Florian Bieberich; Rodrigo Vazquez-Lombardi; Alexander Yermanos; Roy A Ehling; Derek M Mason; Bastian Wagner; Edo Kapetanovic; Raphael Brisset Di Roberto; Cedric R Weber; Miodrag Savic; Fabian Rudolf; Sai T Reddy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430907,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430907,2021-02-12,2021-02-12,,False

416,Single-cell sequencing of plasma cells from COVID-19 patients reveals highly expanded clonal lineages produce specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"Isolation and characterization of antibodies in COVID-19 patients has largely focused on memory B cells, however it is the antibody-secreting plasma cells that are directly responsible for the production of serum antibodies, which play a critical role in controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date there is little known about the specificity of plasma cells in COVID-19 patients. This is largely because plasma cells lack surface antibody expression, which complicates their screening. Here, we describe a technology pipeline that integrates single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing and high-throughput mammalian display screening to interrogate the specificity of plasma cells from 16 convalescent COVID-19 patients. Single-cell sequencing allows us to profile antibody repertoire features in these patients and identify highly expanded clonal lineages. Mammalian display screening is employed to reveal that 37 antibodies (out of 132 candidates) derived from expanded plasma cell clonal lineages are specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including antibodies that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) with high affinity and exhibit potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

This study determined the anti-viral activity of the mouthwash hexetidine (Bactidol(R)), specifically in reducing viral concentration of Human Coronavirus OC43 (HCoV OC43; ATCC(R) VR-1558) and Influenza A virus (IAV H1N1; clinical strain) in Vero 6 and MDCK cell cultures respectively, using in-vitro suspension assay (ASTM E-1052-11) designed to evaluate virucidal property of microbicides like hexetidine.

Study results indicated that hexetidine was able to reduce infectivity of HCoV OC43 and IAV H1N1 at 25%, 50% and 100% concentrations by more than 80% at 15- and 30-seconds exposure times. One hundred percent (100%) concentration of hexetidine was found to be cytotoxic to MDCK cell line used for IAV H1N1 propagation. Hexetidine-treated cell lines achieved >80% survival rate for MDCK and Vero E6 at a contact time of 15 seconds and 30 seconds (which are the approximate times of gargling with hexetidine mouthwash).

The anti-viral activity of hexetidine mouthwash against other more virulent or pathogenic coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 can be explored further.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430728,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430728,2021-02-12,2021-02-12,,False
418,Virus transmission by ultrasonic scaler and its prevention by antiviral agent,"During an ultrasonic scaler (USS) operation, droplets and aerosol are generated that may contribute to the transmission of viruses contained in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid. The purpose of this research was to develop an experimental model for testing the spread of viruses during USS instrumentation and to examining the prevention of spreading by replacing the coolant with an antiviral agent. In a virus transmission tunnel, USS operation with saline coolant and delivery of a viral suspension to the vicinity of USS tip generated droplets and aerosol containing Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV). Evaluation of droplet transmission was evaluated with adherent 48h cell culture monolayer RK13 cell lines in standard 48-well-plates positioned at a distance from 30 to 55 cm. The aerosol was collected by a cyclone aero-sampler flow of 100l/min. Antiviral activity of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite or electrolyzed water (EOW) was tested by suspension test. The two tested antiviral agents transmission prevention ability was evaluated by repeating the same experiment as with saline coolant. All experiments were repeated twice. With saline coolant, the cytopathic effect on cells was found in cells up to the distance of 45 cm, with the number of infected wells decreasing with distance. Viral particles were detected in only one AS in a very low concentration ([&le;]4.2 TCID50/ml). In suspension test of 0.25% NaOCl and EOW, the TCID50/ml was below detection limit after 5s. With both antiviral agents, no cytopathic effect was found. However, the cytotoxic effect of 0.25% NaOCl was evident up to the distance of 35 cm. By USS activity, EAV could be transmitted by droplets up to a distance of 45 cm. Both antiviral agents could prevent virus droplet transmission. The transmission of EAV by aerosol yielded inconclusive results.",Ales Fidler; Andrej Steyer; Rok Gaspersic,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430630,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430630,2021-02-12,2021-02-12,,False
419,SARS-CoV-2 mutations acquired in mink reduce antibody-mediated neutralization,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to farmed mink was observed in Europe and the US. In the infected animals viral variants arose that harbored mutations in the spike (S) protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and these variants were transmitted back to humans. This raised concerns that mink might become a constant source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with an increased threat to human health and resulted in mass culling of mink. Here, we report that mutations frequently found in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from mink were mostly compatible with efficient entry into human cells and its inhibition by soluble ACE2. In contrast, mutation Y453F reduced neutralization by an antibody with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 therapy and by sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that antibody responses induced upon infection or certain antibodies used for treatment might offer insufficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants from mink.",Markus Hoffmann; Lu Zhang; Nadine Krueger; Luise Graichen; Hannah Kleine-Weber; Heike Hofmann-Winkler; Amy Kempf; Stefan Nessler; Joachim Riggert; Martin Sebastian Winkler; Sebastian Schulz; Hans-Martin Jaeck; Stefan Poehlmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430998,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430998,2021-02-12,2021-02-12,,False
420,Differential roles of RIG-I-like receptors in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are the major viral RNA sensors that are essential for activation of antiviral immune responses. However, their roles in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing coronavirus (CoV) infection are largely unknown. Herein we investigate their functions in human epithelial cells, the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and the first line of host defense. A deficiency in MDA5 (MDA5-/-), RIG-I or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) greatly enhanced viral replication. Expression of the type I/III interferons (IFN) was upregulated following infection in wild-type cells, while this upregulation was severely abolished in MDA5-/- and MAVS-/-, but not in RIG-I-/- cells. Of note, ACE2 expression was ~2.5 fold higher in RIG-I-/- than WT cells. These data demonstrate a dominant role of MDA5 in activating the type I/III IFN response to SARS-CoV-2, and an IFN-independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 role of RIG-I.",Duomeng Yang; Tingting Geng; Andrew G Harrison; PENGHUA WANG,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430677,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430677,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,False
421,Adjuvanting a subunit SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine to induce protective immunity in non-human primates,"The development of a portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine under clinical development, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain displayed on a two-component protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five different adjuvants combined with RBD-NP including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion used in pandemic influenza vaccines; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum), a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; or Alum, the most widely used adjuvant. All five adjuvants induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses after two consecutive immunizations. Durable nAb responses were evaluated for RBD-NP/AS03 immunization and the live-virus nAb response was durably maintained up to 154 days post-vaccination. AS03, CpG-Alum, AS37 and Alum groups conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The nAb titers were highly correlated with protection against infection. Furthermore, RBD-NP when used in conjunction with AS03 was as potent as the prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen, HexaPro. Taken together, these data highlight the efficacy of the RBD-NP formulated with clinically relevant adjuvants in promoting robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates.",Prabhu S Arunachalam; Alexandra C Walls; Nadia Golden; Caroline Atyeo; Stephanie Fischinger; Chunfeng Li; Pyone Aye; Mary Jane Navarro; Lilin Lai; Venkata Viswanadh Edara; Katharina Roltgen; Kenneth Rogers; Lisa Shirreff; Douglas E Ferrell; Samuel Wrenn; Deleah Pettie; John C Kraft; Marcos C Miranda; Elizabeth Kepl; Claire Sydeman; Natalie Brunette; Michael Murphy; Brooke Fiala; Lauren Carter; Alexander G White; Meera Trisal; Ching-Lin Hsieh; Kasi Russell-Lodrigue; Christopher Monjure; Jason Dufour; Lara Doyle-Meyer; Rudolph B Bohm; Nicholas J Maness; Chad Roy; Jessica A Plante; Kenneth S Plante; Alex Zhu; Matthew J Gorman; Sally Shin; Xiaoying Shen; Jane Fontenot; Shakti Gupta; Derek T O Hagan; Robbert Van Der Most; Rino Rappuoli; Robert L Coffman; David Novack; Jason S McLellan; Shankar Subramaniam; David Montefiori; Scott D Boyd; JoAnne L Flynn; Galit Alter; Francois Villinger; Harry Kleanthous; Jay Rappaport; Mehul Suthar; Neil P King; David Veesler; Bali Pulendran,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430696,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430696,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,False
422,Accelerating COVID-19 research with graph mining and transformer-based learning,"In 2020, the White House released the, ""Call to Action to the Tech Community on New Machine Readable COVID-19 Dataset,"" wherein artificial intelligence experts are asked to collect data and develop text mining techniques that can help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to COVID-19. The Allen Institute for AI and collaborators announced the availability of a rapidly growing open dataset of publications, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). As the pace of research accelerates, biomedical scientists struggle to stay current. To expedite their investigations, scientists leverage hypothesis generation systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to discover novel implicit connections. We present an automated general purpose hypothesis generation systems AGATHA-C and AGATHA-GP for COVID-19 research. The systems are based on graph-mining and the transformer model. The systems are massively validated using retrospective information rediscovery and proactive analysis involving human-in-the-loop expert analysis. Both systems achieve high-quality predictions across domains (in some domains up to 0.97% ROC AUC) in fast computational time and are released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research. In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

423,Clinical Validation of Automated and Rapid mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test,"Novel SARS coronavirus causing COVID-19 was recognized in late 2019. Diagnostics was quickly ramped up worldwide based on the detection of viral RNA. Based on the scientific knowledge for pre-existing coronaviruses, it was expected that the RNA of this novel coronavirus will be detected at significant rates from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals due to existence of non-infectious RNA. To increase the efficacy of diagnostics, surveillance, screening and pandemic control, rapid methods, such as antigen tests, are needed for decentralized testing and to assess infectiousness. The objectives were to verify analytical sensitivity and specificity, and assess the clinical sensitivity, specificity and usability of a novel automated mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 test based on sophisticated optical laser technology detecting viral structure proteins. Analytical performance was verified using bacterial and viral preparations. Clinical performance of the test was evaluated against qRT-PCR in a retrospective study with nasopharyngeal swab specimens (N=211) collected from symptomatic patients suspected of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections. Sensitivity and specificity of the mariPOC test were 92.3% (12/13) and 100.0% (198/198), respectively. The test's limit of detection was 22 PFU/test and it had no cross-reactions with the tested respiratory microbes. Our study shows that the mariPOC can detect infectious individuals already in 20 minutes while clinical sensitivity close to qRT-PCR is achieved in two hours or less. The test targets conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, making it robust against strain variations. The new test is a promising and versatile tool for syndromic testing of symptomatic cases and for high capacity infection control screening.",Juha M Koskinen; Petri Antikainen; Kristina Hotakainen; Anu Haveri; Niina Ikonen; Carita Savolainen-Kopra; Janne O Koskinen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21250086,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21250086,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True

426,Country specific mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 in pre- and post-international travel ban: Effect on vaccine efficacy,"In order to curb the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2, nation-wide lockdowns were implemented as a preliminary measure. Since most countries enforced travel-bans during end of March 2020, the country-specific patterns should be discernible in the subsequent months. We identified frequently mutated non-synonymous mutations in 2,15,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences during pre and post-travel-ban periods in 35 countries. We further investigated the mutational profile on a bi-monthly basis and traced the progress over the time. Several new mutations have emerged post-travel-ban and on the rise in specific countries, chief among them being A222V and S477N in Spike, and A220V in Nucleocapsid protein. Consequently, we examined the Spike protein epitopes to inspect whether any of these country-specific mutations overlapped with these epitopes. Several mutations were found to be contained within one or more epitopes, including the highly mutated residues of Spike protein, advocating the requirement of active monitoring of vaccine efficacies in respective countries.",Sayantan Laha; Raghunath Chatterjee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251359,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251359,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True
427,How much do superspreaders matter? Epidemic dynamics in inhomogeneous populations,"A variant of the SIR model for an inhomogeneous population is introduced in order to account for the effect of variability in susceptibility and infectiousness across a population. An initial formulation of this dynamics leads to infinitely many differential equations. Our model, however, can be reduced to a single first-order one-dimensional differential equation. Using this approach, we provide quantitative solutions for different distributions. In particular, we use GPS data from ~107 cellphones to determine an empirical distribution of the number of individual contacts and use this to infer a possible distribution of susceptibility and infectivity. We quantify the effect of superspreaders on the early growth rate R0 of the infection and on the final epidemic size, the total number of people who are ever infected.

428,Combinatorial analysis of phenotypic and clinical risk factors associated with hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"1Characterization of the risk factors associated with variability in the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is important. Our previous study using genomic data identified a potential role of calcium and lipid homeostasis in severe COVID-19. This study aimed to identify similar combinations of features (disease signatures) associated with severe disease in a separate patient population with purely clinical and phenotypic data.

The PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform was used to analyze features derived from de-identified health records in the UnitedHealth Group COVID-19 Data Suite. The platform identified and analyzed 836 disease signatures in two cohorts associated with increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Cohort 1 was formed of cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and a set of controls who developed mild symptoms. Cohort 2 included Cohort 1 individuals for whom additional laboratory test data was available.

We found several disease signatures where lower levels of lipids were found co-occurring with lower levels of serum calcium and leukocytes. Many of the low lipid signatures were independent of statin use and 50% of cases with hypocalcemia signatures were reported with vitamin D deficiency. These signatures may be attributed to similar mechanisms linking calcium and lipid signaling where changes in cellular lipid levels during inflammation and infection affect calcium signaling in host cells.

This study and our previous genomics analysis demonstrate that combinatorial analysis can identify disease signatures associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 separately from genomic or clinical data in different populations.

Efforts to estimate the true real-world effectiveness of the vaccine have been hampered by disease dynamics and social-economic discrepancies. Here, using counts of positive and hospitalized cases of vaccinated individuals, we provide sensitive estimations of the vaccine effectiveness by correcting to daily case incidence. We find high effectiveness of 66-85% in reducing SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and over 90% in reducing severe hospitalizations.

433,"Hospitalizations, resource use and outcomes of acute pulmonary embolism in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic - Emergence of different phenotypes of thrombotic disease?","BackgroundThere is discussion evolving around the emergence of different phenotypes of Covid-19-associated thromboembolic disease, i.e. acute pulmonary embolism vs pulmonary thrombosis and different phenotypes of in situ thrombosis. With this study, we wish to provide hospitalization, treatment and in-hospital outcome data for pulmonary embolism during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and a corresponding 2016 - 2019 control period.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of claims data of Helios hospitals in Germany. Consecutive cases with a hospital admission between January 1 and December 15, 2020 and pulmonary embolism as primary discharge diagnosis were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2016 - 2019.

ResultsAs previously reported for other emergent medical conditions, there was a hospitalization deficit coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave. Beginning with the 12-week interval May 6 - July 28, there was a stable surplus of hospital admissions in 2020. During this surplus period (May 6 - December 15, 2020), there were 2,449 hospitalizations including 45 PCR-confirmed Covid-19 cases (1.8%) as opposed to 8,717 in 2016 - 2019 (IRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.18, P<0.01). When excluding Covid-19 cases IRR was 1.10 (95% CI 1.05 - 1.15, P<0.01). While overall comorbidities expressed as weighted AHRQ Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (14.1 {+/-} 10.1 vs. 13.9 {+/-}10.3, P=0.28), the presence of thrombosis (46.1 vs 45.4%, P=0.55) and surgery (3.8 vs. 4.3%, P=0.33) were comparable, coagulopathy (3.3 vs 4.5%, P=0.01) and metastatic cancer (3.0 vs 4.0%, P=0.03) as contributing factors were less frequently observed during the 2020 surplus. Interventional treatments (thrombolytic therapy, thrombectomy or inferior vena cava filter placement) were less frequently used (4.7 vs 6.6%, OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 - 0.89, P< 0.01). Similarly, intensive care (35.1 vs 38.8%, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 - 0.92, P< 0.01) and mechanical ventilation utilization (7.2 vs 8.1%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.04, P=0.14) as well as in-hospital-mortality rates (7.8 vs 9.8%, OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 - 0.90, P< 0.01) were lower in 2020 compared with 2016 - 2019. This was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (6.4 {+/-}5.4 vs. 7.2 {+/-}5.7 days, P< 0.01) during the 2020 surplus period.

434,Hospitalizations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic - Insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network,"BackgroundWhile there are numerous reports that describe emergency care during the early Covid-19 pandemic, there is scarcity of data for later stages. This study analyzes hospitalization rates for 37 emergency-sensitive conditions in the largest German-wide hospital network during different pandemic phases.

MethodsUsing claims data of 80 hospitals, consecutive cases between January 1 and November 17, 2020 were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period in 2019. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) comparing the both periods were calculated using Poisson regression to model the number of hospitalizations per day.

ResultsThere was a hospitalization deficit between March 12 and June 13, 2020 (coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave) with 32,807 hospitalizations as opposed to 39,379 in 2019 (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 - 0.85, P<0.01). During the following period (June 14 to November 17, 2020, including the start of 2nd wave), hospitalizations were reduced from 63,799 in 2019 to 59,910 in 2020, but this reduction was not that pronounced (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 - 0.95, P<0.01). There was an increase in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism after the 1st wave during which hospitalizations had been reduced for those conditions. In contrast, hospitalizations for sepsis, pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary disease, and intracranial injuries were reduced during the entire pandemic.

ConclusionsThere was an overall reduction of hospitalizations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic with heterogeneous effects on different disease categories. The increase of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism is an alarming signal that requires attention and further studies.

435,Data-driven analysis of COVID-19 reveals specific severity patterns distinct from the temporal immune response,"Key immune signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection may associate with either adverse immune reactions (severity) or simply an ongoing anti-viral response (temporality); how immune signatures contribute to severe manifestations and/or temporal progression of disease and whether longer disease duration correlates with severity remain unknown. Patient blood was comprehensively immunophenotyped via mass cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays, leading to the identification of 327 basic subsets that were further stratified into more than 5000 immunotypes and correlated with 28 plasma cytokines. Low-density neutrophil abundance was closely correlated with hepatocyte growth factor levels, which in turn correlated with disease severity. Deep analysis also revealed additional players, namely conventional type 2 dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, plasmablasts and CD16+ monocytes, that can influence COVID-19 severity independent of temporal progression.

436,SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.248: Escape from therapeutic antibodies and antibodies induced by infection and vaccination,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is devastating health systems and economies worldwide. Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.248 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of UK, South Africa and Brazil variant into human cells is susceptible to blockade by entry inhibitors. In contrast, entry of the South Africa and Brazil variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment and was less efficiently inhibited by serum/plasma from convalescent or BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may escape antibody responses, which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic.",Markus Hoffmann; Prerna Arora; Ruediger Gross; Alina Seidel; Bojan Hoernich; Alexander Hahn; Nadine Krueger; Luise Graichen; Heike Hofmann-Winkler; Amy Kempf; Martin Sebastian Winkler; Sebastian Schulz; Hans-Martin Jaeck; Bernd Jahrsdoerfer; Hubert Schrezenmeier; Martin Mueller; Alexander Kleger; Jan Muench; Stefan Poehlmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430787,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430787,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,False

Median CRP was 143 [IQR 107-205] mg/L and 3385 (82%) patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids at randomisation. Overall, 596 (29%) of the 2022 patients allocated tocilizumab and 694 (33%) of the 2094 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.96; p=0.007). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients, including those receiving systemic corticosteroids. Patients allocated to tocilizumab were more likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (54% vs. 47%; rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.12-1.34; p<0.0001). Among those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, patients allocated tocilizumab were less likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (33% vs. 38%; risk ratio 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-0.93; p=0.0005).

438,Novel SARS-CoV-2 spike variant identified through viral genome sequencing of the pediatric Washington D.C. COVID-19 outbreak,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has emerged as a global pandemic, severely impacting everyday life. Significant resources have been dedicated towards profiling the viral genome in the adult population. We present an analysis of viral genomes acquired from pediatric patients presenting to Childrens National Hospital in Washington D.C, including 24 with primary SARS CoV2 infection and 3 with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) undergoing treatment at our facility. Viral genome analysis using next generation sequencing indicated that approximately 81% of the analyzed strains were of the GH clade, 7% of the cases belonged to the GR clade, and 12% of the cases belonged to S, V, or G clades. One sample, acquired from a neonatal patient, presented with the highest viral RNA load of all patients evaluated at our center. Viral sequencing of this sample identified a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant, S:N679S. Analysis of data deposited in the GISAID global database of viral sequences shows the S:N679S variant is present in eight other sequenced samples within the US mid-Atlantic region. The similarity of the regional sequences suggests transmission and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant within the Capitol region, raising the importance of increasing the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.

IMPORTANCEA variant in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was identified in a febrile neonate who was hospitalized with COVID-19. This patient exhibited the highest viral RNA load of any COVID-19 patient tested at our center. Viral sequencing identified a spike protein variant, S:N679S, which is proximal to the cleavage site at residue 681. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike is a protein trimer (three subunits) which serves as the key target for antibody therapies and vaccine development. Study of viral sequences from the GISAID database revealed eight related sequences from the US mid-Atlantic region. The identification of this variant in a very young patient, its critical location in the spike polyprotein, and the evidence that it has been detected in other patients in our region underscores the need for increased viral sequencing to monitor variant prevalence and emergence, which may have a direct impact on recommended public health measures and vaccination strategies.",Jonathan Edward LoTempio Jr.; Erik Antonio Billings; Kyah Draper; Christal Ralph; Madhi Moshgriz; Nhat Duong; Jennifer Dien Bard; Xiaowu Gai; David Wessel; Roberta L DeBiasi; Joseph M Campos; Eric Vilain; Meghan Delaney; Drew G Michael,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251344,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251344,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
439,"Expression of ACE2 receptor, soluble ACE2, Angiotensin I, Angiotensin II and Angiotensin (1-7), is modulated in COVID-19 patients.","Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a pulmonary-tropic virus, it is nonetheless responsible for multi-organ failure in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, particularly those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Infection requires virus binding to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) monocarboxypeptidase, a regulator of blood pressure homeostasis through its ability to catalyze the proteolysis of Angiotensin II (AngII) into Ang(1-7). Although assumed, it had not been proven so far whether the SARS-CoV-2 replication in COVID-19 patients could modulate the expression of the ACE2 receptor and/or the AngII plasma levels. We demonstrate here, that in COVID-19 patients the ACE2 mRNA expression is markedly reduced in circulating blood cells. This ACE2 gene dysregulation mainly affects the monocytes which also show a lower expression of membrane ACE2 protein. Moreover, a significant decrease in soluble ACE2 plasma levels is observed in COVID-19 patients, whereas the concentration of sACE2 returns to normal levels in patients recovered from COVID-19. In the plasma of COVID-19 patients, we also found an increase in AngI and AngII. On the other hand, the plasma levels of Ang(1-7) remains almost stable in COVID-19 patients. Despite the Ang(1-7) presence in the plasma of COVID-19 patients it seems insufficient to prevent the effects of massive AngII accumulation. These are the first direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 may affect the expression of blood pressure regulators with possible harmful consequences on COVID-19 outcome.",Ikram Omar OSMAN; Clea Menelotte Jr.; Philippe Brouqui; Matthieu MILLION; Jean-christophe LAGIER; Phillipe PAROLA; Andreas STEIN; Bernard LA SCOLA; Line MEDDEB; Jean-Louis MEGE; Didier RAOULT; Christian Albert DEVAUX,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251001,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251001,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
440,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the Bronx enables clinical and epidemiological inference,"The Bronx was an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We conducted temporal genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the Bronx from March-October 2020. Although the local structure of SARS-CoV-2 lineages mirrored those of New York City and New York State, temporal sampling revealed a dynamic and changing landscape of SARS- CoV-2 genomic diversity. Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some have become 'endemic' to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late summer/early fall. Geographically resolved genomes enabled us to distinguish between a case of reinfection and a case of persistent infection. We propose that limited, targeted, temporal genomic surveillance has clinical and epidemiological utility in managing the ongoing COVID pandemic.",J.

441,Associations of DMT therapies with COVID-19 severity in multiple sclerosis,"Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are a vulnerable group for severe COVID-19, particularly those taking immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS. Methods: Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated. Demographic and clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes, hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression. Results: 657 (28.1%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analysed. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01-2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.48-4.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39; aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89), though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.75,95%CI=1.29-2.38; aOR=2.76,95%CI=1.87-4.07) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55,95%CI=1.49-4.36; aOR=4.32,95%CI=2.27-8.23) but only rituximab with artificial ventilation (aOR=6.15,95%CI=3.09-12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.86,95%CI=1.13-3.07; aOR=2.88,95%CI=1.68-4.92) and ICU admission (aOR=2.13,95%CI=0.85-5.35; aOR=3.23,95%CI=1.17-8.91), but only rituximab with ventilation (aOR=5.52,95%CI=1.71-17.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Conclusions: Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and requiring artificial ventilation, and ocrelizumab with hospitalisation and ICU admission, suggesting their use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.",Steve Simpson-Yap; Edward De Brouwer; Tomas Kalincik; Nick Rijke; Jan Hillert; Clare Walton; Gilles Edan; YVES Yves MOREAU; Tim Spelman; Lotte Geys; Tina Parciak; Clement Gautrais; Nikola Lazovski; Ashkan Pirmani; Amin Ardeshirdavani; Lars Forsberg; Anna Glaser; Robert McBurney; Hollie Schmidt; Arnfin Bergmann; Stefan Braune; Alexander Stahmann; Rodden Middleton; Amber Salter; Robert J Fox; Anneke van der Walt; Helmut Butzkueven; Raed Al-Roughani; Serkan Ozakbas; Juan I Rojas; Ingrid van der Mei; Nupur Nag; Rumen Ivanov; Guilherme Sciascia do Olival; Alice Estavo Dias; Melinda Magyari; Doralina Guimaraes Brum; Maria Fernanda Mendes; Ricardo Alonso; Richard Nicholas; Johana Bauer; Anibal Chertcoff; Anna Zabalza; Georgina Arrambide; Alexander Fidao; Giancarlo Comi; Liesbet Peeters,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251316,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251316,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
442,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission, vaccination rate and the fate of resistant strains","Vaccines are thought to be the best available solution for controlling the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [1,2]. However, the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains [3-6] may come too rapidly for current vaccine developments to alleviate the health, economic and social consequences of the pandemic [7,8]. To quantify and characterize the risk of such a scenario, we created a SIR-derived model [9,10] with initial stochastic dynamics of the vaccine-resistant strain to study the probability of its emergence and establishment. Using parameters realistically resembling SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we model a wave-like pattern of the pandemic and consider the impact of the rate of vaccination and the strength of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. We found a counterintuitive result that the highest probability for the establishment of the resistant strain comes at a time of reduced non-pharmaceutical intervention measures when most individuals of the population have been vaccinated. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions [7,11,12] throughout the entire vaccination period.",Simon Rella; Yuliya Kulikova; Emmanouil Dermitzakis; Fyodor Kondrashov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251383,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251383,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True

A first series of official published data from March 1st to May 31st, 2020 was used to adjust the model parameters aiming to forecast one year of the COVID-19 evolutionary outbreak. The cohort study was set as a city population-based analysis. The population-based sample, 25,366 during the study period, was the number of confirmed cases on exposed individuals.

444,"Assessment of Post SARS CoV 2 Fatigue among Physicians Working in COVID Designated Hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh","BackgroundFatigue has been observed after a number of infectious disease outbreaks around the world. After the outbreak of SARS CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in 2019, the disease turned into a pandemic very rapidly. Mental health is a key issue associated with such outbreaks. To explore the fatigue level among physicians working in designated public and private hospitals in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study of post-SARS-CoV-2 fatigue.

MethodIn this study 105 physicians who were diagnosed as COVID-19 infected, got treatment, and declared cured at least 6 weeks before the interview date, were recruited as cases and the same number of age and designation matched healthy physicians as control who are working in the same hospital. Case and control were selected in 1:1 ratio from each of the hospitals. The study population was selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria after taking informed written consent. Data collection was done by a semi-structured questionnaire. Diagnosis of COVID--19 infection was done by detection of SARS CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR from reference laboratories in Bangladesh or by HRCT Chest.

ResultAround two-thirds of the physicians were male (67.6% versus 32.4%). Most of them aged less than forty years (80.5%). The cases had a greater number of comorbid conditions than those who were negative. The FSS score (mean) was much higher for cases (36.7 {+/-} 5.3 versus 19.3 {+/-} 3.8) than the control group with a statistically significant difference with no significant gender differentiation. Similarly, around 67.7% of the previously COVID positive physicians represented in the highest FSS score tertile compared to the respondents in the control group had a mean score of less than 3. The difference was also highly significant.

ObjectivesTo estimate the associations between daily residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, and meteorology, and daily cases and deaths for COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

MethodsWe applied a semiparametric generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate: 1) the association between residential mobility index and cases and deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), relative humidity, temperature and delayed exposure between 3-21 days and 2) the association between exposure to for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), accounting for relative humidity, temperature and mobility.

ResultsWe found an RMI of 45.28% results in 1,212 cases (95% CI: 1,189 to 1,235) and 44 deaths (95% CI: 40 to 47). Reducing mobility 5% would avoid 438 cases and 21 deaths. Also, we found that an increment of 10 g{middle dot}m-3 of PM2.5 risk of 1.140 (95% CI: 1.021 to 1.274) for cases and of 1.086 (95% CI: 1.008 to 1.170) for deaths, while O3 produces a relative risk of 1.075 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.150) for cases and 1.063 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.124) for deaths, respectively.

DiscussionWe compared our results with observations and literature review, finding well agreement. These results implicate that authorities and policymakers can use such mobility indices as tools to support social distance activities and assess their effectiveness in the coming weeks and months. Small increments of air pollution pose a risk of COVID-19 cases.

ConclusionSpatial distancing is a determinant factor to control cases and deaths for COVID-19. Small increments of air pollution result in a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

To better understand temporal evolution of COVID-19 related serological and other immune responses during a pandemic, we designed and implemented a baseline cross-sectional study of asymptomatic community volunteers and first responders in metro-Atlanta before the predicted infection peak in 2020. Methods: We recruited healthy community volunteers and first responders for health history, serology, and biobanking. Through an iterative process, we identified one location on our campus and one community location which were accessible, vacant, distant from COVID-19 testing sites, open for social distancing, private for informed consent, and operational for sanitation and ventilation. Research and cleaning supplies were obtained from other researchers and private online vendors due to shortages, and faculty directly participated in consenting and phlebotomy. Results: A total of 369 participants completed the study visits over six full and three half days. Over half of Phase 1 (174/299, 58.2%) and Phase 2 (45/70, 64.3%) self-reported as healthcare workers, and there was a high percentage of participants reporting exposure to known COVID-19 cases (48.2% and 61.4%).

447,"Population-Based Study of anti-SARS-CoV-2, Social Distancing and Government Responses in Joinville, Brazil","Background: The city of Joinville had been mildly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic until June 2020. This study aimed to longitudinally assess the prevalence of exposure to the virus and social distancing practices in the local population. Methods: A randomized selection of households stratified by region was created. From June 15 to August 7, 2020, a dweller was randomized in each household, answered a questionnaire, and performed a test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The prevalence of positive tests was calculated for each week and adjusted for the test's sensitivity and specificity. Results: The adjusted proportion of positive results increased from 1.4% in the first week (margin of error [ME] 0% to 2.87%) to 13.38% in the eighth week (ME 10.22% to 16.54%). Among the 213 participants that tested positive, 55 (25.82%) were asymptomatic. Only 37 (17.37%) sought medical consultation for any symptom. Among the 77 (36.15%) that were leaving home to work or study, only 18 (23.38%) stopped due to any symptom. The proportion that referred going to bars, restaurants, or making non-essential shopping decreased from 20.56% in the first week to 8.61% during the peak of diagnoses.

448,Machine learning approach to dynamic risk modeling of mortality in COVID-19: a UK Biobank cohort study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths globally. There is an urgent need for robust, scalable monitoring tools supporting resource allocation and stratification of high-risk patients. This research aims to develop and validate prediction models, using the UK Biobank to estimate COVID-19 mortality risk in confirmed cases. We developed a random forest classification model using baseline characteristics, pre-existing conditions, symptoms, and vital signs, such that the score could dynamically assess risk of mortality with disease deterioration (AUC: 0.92). The design and feature selection of the framework lends itself to deployment in remote settings. Possible applications include supporting individual-level risk profiling and monitoring disease progression across high volumes of patients with COVID-19, especially in hospital-at-home settings.",Mohammad A.

449,Large-scale silane bead-based SARS-CoV-2 testing of a nursing home in Spain identifies a viral reservoir during lockdown period,"Background: Spain is one of the countries most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As in other countries such as UK and USA, nursing homes have been an important human reservoir for the virus and the population with the highest mortality worldwide. The presence of asymptomatic carriers within nursing homes is one of the factors that could provoke new outbreaks during the relaxing of lockdown measures. Methods: We developed a high-throughput protocol for RNA extraction of patient samples based on silane magnetic beads in multi-well plates. The sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility rates were assessed using positive and negative clinical samples from the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Spain. We utilized the protocol to test a pilot cohort of 138 residents and 87 staff from a nursing home in Northern Navarre, Spain. Findings: Our protocol showed high sensitivity (100%), specificity (96.0%) and linear correlation with PCR cycle threshold values obtained with a standard testing kit (R2 = 0.807, p=3E-05). Testing of 225 individuals from the nursing home revealed 63 residents (46%) and 14 staff (16%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 18 of the positive residents (28.6%) were symptomatic at time of testing. During follow-up, six PCR-negative symptomatic residents were retested and resulted positive. One-month mortality among positive residents was higher than in negative residents (15.9% vs 1.3%), regardless of age or comorbidities. Interpretation: Rapid silane bead-based RNA extraction expanded the testing capabilities and COVID-19 patients were promptly identified. Personal and public health measures were enacted to avoid spreading and tighten clinical surveillance. The ability to easily adapt the technical capabilities of academic research centers to large-scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 could provide an invaluable tool for ensuring a safe lifting of lockdown in countries with high numbers of cases.",Nick Weber; Ainhoa Goni-Salaverri; Jose A Rodriguez; Juan Pablo Unfried; Daniel Alameda; Mirian Fernandez-Alonso; Elena Saez; Sheila Maestro-Galilea; Felix Alegre; Francisco Carmona-Torre; Marta Marin-Oto; Cristina Olague; Leticia Odriozola; Mar Navarro-Alonso; Rafael Sanchez-Ostiz; Josepmaria Argemi; Jose Luis del Pozo; DAVID LARA-ASTIASO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251358,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251358,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
450,Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in the Republic of Ireland during waves 1 and 2 of the pandemic,"Abstract: Background: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases can provide insights into viral transmission and genetic diversity at a population level. However, less is known about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including lockdowns, on circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages and variants of concern, the relative contribution of travel to re-emergence of pandemic waves within communities or how different lineages and variants contribute to disease severity. Methods: We have conducted an analysis within a prospective, multicentre observational study of individuals attending four hospitals in the South-East of Ireland with COVID-19. Samples underwent WGS from which lineages and variants were assigned, lineage frequency was plotted over time and phylogenetic analysis was employed to determine the origin of variants detected post-lockdown. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed relationships between viral lineage/variant and COVID-19 disease severity. Results: We analysed 225 genome sequences across two SARS-CoV-2 waves, 134 (59.6%) from wave 1 (March to June) and 91 (40.4%) from wave 2 (July to December), representing 15.2% of COVID-19 admissions to these hospitals during the sampling periods. Four variants (B.1.1.162, B1.1.70, B.1.1.267 and B.1.1) comprised 68% of variants detected during wave 1. Of these variants, only a single B.1.1.70 sequence was detected in wave 2, while the B.1.177 lineage emerged and contributed to 82.3% of lineages detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of wave 2 variants from outside Ireland. We found no consistent association between SARS-CoV-2 lineages and disease severity. Conclusions: These data suggest elimination of common SARS-CoV-2 lineages from hospitalised cases associated with effective NPIs and that importation of new viral variants through travel was a significant contributor to the re-emergence of the pandemic in the second wave in Ireland.

452,Estimating the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections reported through diagnostic testing,"The number of positive diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 is a critical metric that is commonly used to assess epidemic severity and the efficacy of current levels of control. However, a proportion of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may never receive a diagnostic test, while many of those who are tested may receive a false negative result. Consequently, cases reported through testing of symptomatic individuals represent only a fraction of the total number of infections, and this proportion is expected to vary depending on changes in natural factors and variability in test-seeking behaviour. Here we combine a number of data sources from England to estimate the proportion of infections that have resulted in a positive diagnosis. Using published estimates of the incubation period distribution and time-dependent test sensitivity, we estimate SARS-CoV-2 incidence from daily reported diagnostic test data. By calibrating this estimate against surveillance data we find that approximately 25\% of infections were consistently reported through diagnostic testing before November 2020. This percentage increased through the final months of 2020, predominantly in regions with a large presence of the the UK variant of concern (VOC), before falling rapidly in the last two weeks of January 2021. These changes are not explained by variation in rates of lateral flow device or PCR testing, but are consistent with there being an increased probability for the VOC that infection will result in an eventual positive diagnosis.",Ewan Colman; Jessica Enright; Gavrila Amadea Puspitarani; Rowland Raymond Kao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251411,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True

Methods: Cohort study (population-based) including 79,083 people >=50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). At study start (01/03/2020) baseline cohort characteristics (demographic, previous comorbidities, chronic medications and vaccinations history) were recorded. Primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed COVID19 incurred in cohort members throughout 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Risk of suffering COVID19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age/sex and previous comorbidities. Results: Across study period, 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID19 cases were observed (mean incidence: 39.5 cases per 100,000 persons-week). In multivariable-analysis, age/years (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02; p=0.050), nursing-home (HR: 20.19; 95% CI: 15.98-25.51; p<0.001), neurological disease (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03-1.77; p=0.029), taking diuretics (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10-1.75; p=0.006), antiplatelet (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05-1.76; p=0.021) and benzodiazepines (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.53; p=0.047) significantly increased risk; while smoking (HR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.41-0.80; p=0.001), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61-1.00; p=0.048), angiotensin II receptor blockers (HR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.51-0.96; p=0.027) and statins (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.96; p=0.025) were associated with reduced risk. Among non-institutionalised persons, cancer, renal and cardiac disease appeared also related to increased risk, whereas influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk. Conclusion: In a setting with relatively low incidence of COVID19 across the first wave of pandemic period, age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID19 among middle-aged/older adults.

454,Naive human B cells can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through recognition of its receptor binding domain,"Exposure to a pathogen elicits an adaptive immune response aimed to control and eradicate. This initial exposure is imprinted on the immune system, so that a subsequent encounter to the same pathogen or a variant will result in a memory recall response that is often protective. Interrogating the naive B cell repertoire in terms of both abundance and specificity to said pathogen may contribute to an understanding of how to potentially elicit protective responses. Here, we isolated naive B cells across 8 human donors, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Single B cell sorting, and subsequent sequence analysis, showed diverse gene usage and pairing with no apparent restriction on complementarity determining region length in either the heavy or light chains. We show that recombinantly expressed IgGs and Fabs of these germline precursors bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, a subset of these naive antibodies also bind SARS-CoV, an emergent variant (501Y.V2) and a potential pandemic (WIV-1) coronavirus. Furthermore, naive antibodies can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the absence of any somatic hypermutation, suggesting that protective immunity to coronaviruses, more broadly, may be genetically encoded. Future studies aimed at understanding the naive repertoire to other coronaviruses may ultimately reveal shared specificities that could be leveraged to develop pan-coronavirus vaccines aimed at priming encoded germline responses.",Jared Feldman; Julia Bals; Kerri St. Denis; Evan C.

Herein we describe an ACE2-lentivirus system and illustrate its utility for in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Transduction of non-permissive cell lines with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K, F83Y and H353K substitutions, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. hACE2-lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J, IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice lungs illustrated that removing type I or III interferon responses had no significant effect on virus replication. However, RNA-Seq analyses illustrated they were required for the inflammatory responses, which were similar to those seen in COVID-19 patients. We also illustrate the utility of hACE2 transduction for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. In summary, we establish a hACE2-lentivirus mouse model which has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, while also offering the inherent advantages of lentiviral transduction such as stable genomic integration.",Daniel J Rawle; Thuy T Le; Troy Dumenil; Kexin Yan; Bing Tang; Cameron Bishop; Andreas Suhrbier,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430547,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430547,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,False
456,In vitro evolution of Remdesivir resistance reveals genome plasticity of SARS-CoV-2,"Remdesivir (RDV) is used widely for COVID-19 patients despite varying results in recent clinical trials. Here, we show how serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in the presence of RDV selected for drug-resistant viral populations. We determined that the E802D mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was sufficient to confer decreased RDV sensitivity without affecting viral fitness. Analysis of more than 200,000 sequences of globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants show no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants. Surprisingly, we also observed changes in the Spike (i.e., H69 E484, N501, H655) corresponding to mutations identified in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants indicating that they can arise in vitro in the absence of immune selection. This study illustrates SARS-CoV-2 genome plasticity and offers new perspectives on surveillance of viral variants.

457,Bifurcated monocyte states are predictive of mortality in severe COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with varied clinical manifestations1, ranging from mild symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality2,3. Despite extensive analyses, there remains an urgent need to delineate immune cell states that contribute to mortality in severe COVID-19. We performed high-dimensional cellular and molecular profiling of blood and respiratory samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients to define immune cell genomic states that are predictive of outcome in severe COVID-19 disease. Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) manifested increased frequencies of inflammatory monocytes and plasmablasts that were also associated with ARDS not due to COVID-19. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq)-based deconvolution of genomic states of peripheral immune cells revealed distinct gene modules that were associated with COVID-19 outcome. Notably, monocytes exhibited bifurcated genomic states, with expression of a cytokine gene module exemplified by CCL4 (MIP-1{beta}) associated with survival and an interferon signaling module associated with death. These gene modules were correlated with higher levels of MIP-1{beta} and CXCL10 levels in plasma, respectively. Monocytes expressing genes reflective of these divergent modules were also detectable in endotracheal aspirates. Machine learning algorithms identified the distinctive monocyte modules as part of a multivariate peripheral immune system state that was predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Follow-up analysis of the monocyte modules on ICU day 5 was consistent with bifurcated states that correlated with distinct inflammatory cytokines. Our data suggests a pivotal role for monocytes and their specific inflammatory genomic states in contributing to mortality in life-threatening COVID-19 disease and may facilitate discovery of new diagnostics and therapeutics.",Anthony R Cillo; Ashwin Somasundaram; Feng Shan; Carly Cardello; Creg J Workman; Georgios D Kitsios; Ayana Ruffin; Sheryl Kunning; Caleb Lampenfeld; Sayali Onkar; Stephanie Grebinowski; Gaurav Deshmukh; Barbara Methe; Chang Liu; Sham Nambulli; Lawrence Andrews; W.

Vaccines approved for use and those in development intend to use neutralizing antibodies to block viral sites binding to the hosts cellular receptors. Virus infection is mediated by the spike glycoprotein trimer on the virion surface via its receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody response to this domain is an important outcome of the immunization and correlates well with viral neutralization. Here we show that macromolecular constructs with recombinant RBD conjugated to tetanus toxoid induce a potent immune response in laboratory animals. Some advantages of the immunization with the viral antigen coupled to tetanus toxoid have become evident such as predominant IgG immune response due to affinity maturation and long-term specific B-memory cells.

Proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the S1/S2 boundary facilitates interaction with host ACE2 receptor for cell entry. To address this, high titer antibody was generated against the SARS-CoV-2-specific furin motif. Using a series of innovative ELISA-based assays, this furin site blocking antibody displayed high sensitivity and specificity for the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, and demonstrated effective blockage of both enzyme-mediated cleavage and spike-ACE2 interaction.

460,Dual RNA-Seq analysis of SARS-CoV-2 correlates specific human transcriptional response pathways directly to viral expression,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has challenged humankinds ability to quickly determine the cascade of health effects caused by a novel infection. Even with the unprecedented speed at which vaccines were developed and introduced into society, identifying therapeutic interventions and drug targets for patients infected with the virus remains important as new strains of the virus may evolve, or future coronaviruses may emerge, that are resistant to current vaccines. The application of transcriptomic RNA sequencing of infected samples may shed new light on the pathways involved in viral mechanisms and host responses. We describe the application of ""dual RNA-seq"" analysis to consider both the host and pathogen transcriptomes simultaneously, to investigate for the first time the co-regulation of human and SARS-CoV-2 genes. Together with differential expression analysis, we describe the tissue specificity of SARS-CoV-2 expression, an inferred lipopolysaccharide response, and co-regulation of CXCLs, SPRRs, S100s with SARS-CoV-2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide response pathways in particular offer promise for future therapeutic research and the prospect of subgrouping patients based on chemokine expression that may help explain the vastly different reactions patients have to infection.

461,Exosomes from COVID-19 patients carry tenascin-C and fibrinogen-β in triggering inflammatory signals in distant organ cells,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-{beta} (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-{kappa}B pathway, we examined the status of TNF-, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients.

ImportanceExosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs and promotes pathogenesis.

Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters.

463,Intranasal type I interferon treatment is beneficial only when administered before clinical signs onset in the SARS-CoV-2 hamster model,"Impaired type I interferons (IFNs) production or signaling have been associated with severe COVID-19, further promoting the evaluation of recombinant type I IFNs as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the Syrian hamster model, we show that intranasal administration of IFN- starting one day pre-infection or one day post-infection limited weight loss and decreased viral lung titers. By contrast, intranasal administration of IFN- starting at the onset of symptoms three days post-infection had no impact on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence that early type I IFN treatments are beneficial, while late interventions are ineffective, although not associated with signs of enhanced disease.

464,A Human 3D neural assembloid model for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Clinical evidence suggests the central nervous system (CNS) is frequently impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or indirectly, although mechanisms remain unclear. Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points1. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Prior to infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral  replication hubs, with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids (PCCOs) represent a new  assembloid model2 that supports SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in neural tissue, and PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural infection.",Joseph G Gleeson; Lu Wang; David Sievert; Alex E Clark; Hannah Federman; Benjamin D Gastfriend; Eric Shusta; Sean Palecek; Aaron Carlin; Alex E.

465,Poor antigen-specific responses to the second BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals,"The advent of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. Vaccine candidates have demonstrated robust humoral responses and have protected against infection. However, efficacy trials were focused on individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and, as a result, little is known about immune responses induced by these mRNA vaccines in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immune responses in 32 subjects who received two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. In individuals naive to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. These data highlight an important gap in our knowledge and may have major implications for how these vaccines should be used to prevent COVID-19.

466,"The effect of respiratory activity, ventilatory therapy and facemasks on total aerosol emissions","Background Exhaled respirable aerosols (<5 m diameter) present a high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Many guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during ""aerosol generating procedures"" (AGPs) and droplet (>5 m) precautions at other times. However, there is emerging evidence that respiratory activities such as cough and not AGPs are the important source of aerosols. Methods We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 L/min to count and size-fractionate all exhaled particles (0.5-25 m). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during respiratory ""activities"" (quiet breathing, talking, shouting, forced expiratory maneuvers, exercise and coughing) with respiratory ""therapies"" designated as AGPs: high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, respectively. Activities were repeated wearing facemasks. Results Compared to quiet breathing, respiratory activities increased particle counts between 34.6-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2 to 79.1) during talking, to 370.8-fold (95% CI, 162.3 to 847.1) during coughing (p<0.001). During quiet breathing, HFNO at 60 L/min increased counts 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.4) (p=0.03) and NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D at 25/10 cm H2O increased counts by 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.1) and 7.8-fold (95% CI, 4.4 to 13.6) respectively (p<0.001). During activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared to activities alone. Conclusion Talking, exertional breathing and coughing generate substantially more aerosols than the respiratory therapies HFNO and NIPPV which can reduce total emissions.

467,How to decide which COVID-19 patient with myocardial infarction to send to the Cath Lab? - A case series of COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction,"INTRODUCTIONThe Coronavirus pandemic has hit the world with its vast contagiousness, high morbidity, and mortality. Apart from the direct damage to the lung tissue, the corona virus infection is able to predispose patients to thrombotic disease, thus causing cerebral or coronary incidents.

AIMSThe aim of this study was to find a clinical or laboratory parameter, that would help in distinguishing between COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), who have an infarct-related artery (IRA) and therefore, require immediate revascularization, and those, who have no IRA.

METHODSThis was a single-center, observational study of 10 consecutive patients with COVID-19, who were admitted with confirmed MI.

RESULTSIn our study group the mean age was 67.5 {+/-} 8.3 years, half of the patients were female; all of them had arterial hypertension; 8 patients (80%) had dyslipidemy; 4 (40%) had diabetes. 30% of the patients with MI did not have an IRA, and did not require pPCI. Patients with MI and IRA had significantly higher hsTrI values (48.9 {+/-} 43.2 vs 0.6 {+/-} 0.7, p=0.007) and exclusively typical chest pain 100% vs 0%, p=0.007), compared to patients with MI without an IRA. The ECG changes had only marginal statistical significance. Our results suggest that using a higher cut-off value for hsTrI (>7.5 times upper reference range) increases the specificity and positive predictive value for diagnosing a MI with the presence of IRA and need for pPCI, to 100%

468,Multivariate spatio-temporal analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant mortality and disruption on a global scale not seen in living memory. Understanding the spatial and temporal vectors of transmission as well as similarities in the trajectories of recorded cases and deaths across countries can aid in understanding the benefit or otherwise of varying interventions and control strategies on virus transmission. It can also highlight emerging globa trends as they occur. Data on number of cases and deaths across the globe have been made available through a variety of databases and provide a wide range of opportunities for the application of multivariate statistical methods to extract information on similarity or difference from them. Here we conduct spatial and temporal multivariate statistical analyses of global Covid-19 cases and deaths for the period spanning January to August 2020, using a variety of distance based multivariate methods to cluster countries according to similar temporal trends in cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19. We also use novel air passenger data as a proxy for movement between countries. The air passenger movement can act as an important vector of transmission and thus scaling covariance matrices before conducting dimension reduction techniques can account for known structures in the data and help highlight important residual spatial and/or temporal trends that may then be attributable to the success of interventions or other cultural differences. Global temporal structure is found to be of significantly more importance than local spatial structure in terms of global dynamics. Our results highlight a significant global change in case and mortality daynamics from early-August, consistent in timing with the emergence of new strains with highger levels of transmission. We propose the methodology offers great potential in real-time analysis of complex, noisy spatio-temporal data and the extraction of emerging changes in pandemic dynamics that can support policy and decision makers.",Wen Xiang; Ben Swallow,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251339,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251339,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
469,Rapid Impact Analysis of B 1.1.7 Variant on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in North Carolina,"BackgroundSeveral cases of the B1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified in North Carolina first on January 23, 2021 in Mecklenburg County and later in Guilford County on January 28, 2021.[1,2] This variant has been associated with higher levels of transmissibility.[3-6] This study examines the potential impact of increased transmissibility as the B1.1.7 variant becomes more predominant given current vaccine distribution plans and existing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).

MethodWe explored the anticipated impact on the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County given the date of import of B1.1.7. The approximate growth rate in proportion of B1.1.7 observed in the United Kingdom was fit and used to establish the estimate share of B1.1.7 circulating in North Carolina. Using the nowcasted reproduction numbers, a stochastic discrete compartmental model was fit with the current vaccination rates and B1.1.7 transmissibility to estimate the impact on the effective reproduction number.

ResultsWe found that the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County may exceed one, indicating a return to accelerating spread of infection in April as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases. The effective reproduction number will likely decrease into March, then increase as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases in circulation in the population.

ConclusionsExisting non-pharmaceutical interventions will need to remain in effect through the spring. Given the current vaccination rate and these interventions, it is likely that there will be an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The impact of the variant will likely be heterogeneous across North Carolina given the reproduction number and volume of susceptible persons in each county at the time of introduction of the variant. Age-based vaccinations will likely reduce the overall impact on hospitalizations.

470,L18F substrain of SARS-CoV-2 VOC-202012/01 is rapidly spreading in England,"The Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7) is a rapidly growing lineage of SARS-CoV-2. In January 2021, VOC-202012/01 constituted about 80% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England and was present in 27 out of 29 countries that reported at least 50 viral genomes. As this strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. Based on GISAID data we systematically estimated growth rates of mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that L18F substitution in viral spike protein has initiated a substrain characterized by replicative advantage of 1.70 [95% CI: 1.56-1.96] in relation to the remaining VOC-202012/01 substrains. The L18F mutation is of significance because when recently analyzed in the context of the South African strain 501Y.V2 it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. We additionally indicate three mutations that were acquired by VOC-202012/01 in the receptor binding motif of spike, specifically E484K, F490S, and S494P, that may also give rise to escape mutants. Such mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.",Frederic Grabowski; Marek Kochanczyk; Tomasz Lipniacki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251262,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251262,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True

472,Impact on Mental Health of students due to restriction caused by COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional study,"BackgroundThe aim of the study was to investigate fear, depression and anxiety symptoms among students of India due to COVID-19 pandemic and its restriction.

MethodThe cross-sectional web-based research was conducted between mid-November and mid-December 2020 with the objective of understanding the psychological and behavioral consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on students due to the constraint of forced control. The questionnaire included a) socio-demographic questions and b) psychometric scales evaluating the psychological and behavioral impact caused by COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions.

ResultsTotal number of 324 students participated in this study in which 44.4% were male and 55.6% were female. Fear of COVID-19 scale showed 68.8% of students had high fear, 24.4% had moderate to severe depression and 51.5% had moderate to severe anxiety. The correlation of fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19s) with Generalized Anxiety scale (GAD-7) and brief patient health questionnaire scale (PHQ-9) was found to be 0.492 and 0.474 respectively.

DesignThere was retrospective and prospective data collection using standard tools. We determined the prevalence of fever and cough in households. We evaluated household knowledge about COVID-19 prevention and adherence to preventive measures. We evaluated the presence of a workforce, essential infrastructure and equipment needed for COVID-19 case management, and the availability of essential maternal and child health services in health facilities.

SettingSiaya in rural Western Kenya

Participantshouseholds and health facilities in Siaya

ResultsWe visited 19474 households and assessed 152 facilities. The prevalences of fever and cough ranged from 1.4% to 4.3% and 0.2 to 0.8% respectively; 97% and 98% of households had not received a guest from nor travelled outside Siaya respectively; 97% knew about frequent handwashing, 66% knew about keeping distance, and 80% knew about wearing a mask; 63% washed their hands countless times; 53% remained home; and 74% used a mask when out in public. The health facility assessment showed: 93.6% were dispensaries and health centers; 90.4% had nurses; 40.5% had oxygen capacity; 13.5% had pulse oximeters; and 2 ventilators were available; 94.2% of facilities did not have COVID-19 testing kits; 94% and 91% of facilities continued to provide antenatal care and immunization services respectively. Health care worker training in COVID-19 had been planned.

ConclusionsHousehold prevalence of fever and cough was low suggesting Siaya had not entered the active community transmission phase in June 2020. Our assessment revealed a need for training in COVID-19 case management, and a need for basic equipment and supplies including pulse oximeters and oxygen. Future interventions should address these gaps.

474,Galectin-3 as a potential prognostic biomarker of severe COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"BACKGROUNDPrognostic biomarkers are needed to identify patients at high-risk for severe COVID-19. Galectin-3 is known to drive neutrophil infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributing to airway inflammation.

METHODSIn this prospective cohort, we assessed galectin-3 levels in 156 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were diagnosed as either critical (>50% lung damage) or moderate (<50% of lung damage) based on computerized tomography. Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or died during hospitalization were categorized as having a severe outcome, and a non-severe outcome if they were discharged and none of the former occurred.

RESULTSElevated serum galectin-3 was significantly higher in critical patients compared to moderate ones (35.91 {+/-} 19.37 ng/mL vs. 25 {+/-} 14.85 ng/mL, p<0.0001). Patients who progressed to a severe outcome including IMV and/or in-hospital death, presented higher galectin-3 levels (41.17 ng/mL [IQR 29.71 - 52.25] vs. 23.76 ng/mL [IQR 15.78 - 33.97] compared to those of a non-severe outcome, p<0.0001). Galectin-3 discriminated well between those with severe and non-severe outcome, with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 - 0.84, p<0.0001) and was found to be an independent predictor of severe outcome regardless of the percentage of lung involvement. Additionally, the combination of galectin-3, CRP and albumin, significantly improved its individual predicting ability with an AUC 0.84 (95% CI 0.77 - 0.91, p<0.0001).

CONCLUSIONCirculating galectin-3 levels can be used to predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including the requirement of mechanical ventilation and/or death, regardless of the initial severity of the disease.",Eduardo Cervantes-Alvarez; Nathaly Limon-de la Rosa; Moises Salgado-de la Mora; Paola Valdez-Sandoval; Mildred Palacios-Jimenez; Fatima Rodriguez-Alvarez; Brenda I.

475,The protective association between statins use and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionStatins may reduce a cytokine storm, which has been hypothesized as a possible mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage.

MethodsLiteratures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsThirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75). The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88).

Moreover, the use of these designs is wide spreading and nowadays they are used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples to act as epidemiological surveillance tool. However, at the time of designing the published RT-qPCR assays, a lack of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available may explain a low exclusivity in some cases.

Here we used the patient data from the multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 - Infected Patients (LEOSS) and applied a technique of variable selection in order to develop a simplified score to identify patients at increased risk of critical illness or death.

A total of 1,946 patients, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the initial analysis. They were split into a derivation and a validation cohort (n=1,297 and 649, respectively). A stability selection among a total of 105 baseline predictors for the combined endpoint of progression to critical phase or COVID-19-related death allowed us to develop a simplified score consisting of five predictors: CRP, Age, clinical disease phase (uncomplicated vs. complicated), serum urea and D-dimer (abbreviated as CAPS-D score). This score showed an AUC of 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) in the validation cohort for predicting the combined endpoint within 7 days of diagnosis and 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) during the full follow-up. Finally, we used an additional prospective cohort of 682 patients, who were diagnosed largely after the ""first wave"" of the pandemic to validate predictive accuracy of the score, observing similar results (AUC for an event within 7 days: 0.83, CI95%, 0.78-0.87; for full follow-up: 0.82, CI95%, 0.78-0.86).

We thus successfully establish and validate an easily applicable score to calculate the risk of disease progression of COVID-19 to critical illness or death.",Stanislas Werfel; Carolin E. M.

478,"COVID-19 infection and outcomes in a population-based cohort of 17,173 adults with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population","ObjectivesTo compare COVID-19 infection, severe infection, mortality, case-fatality, and excess deaths, among adults with intellectual disabilities and those without.

DesignRecord-linkage of all adults recorded with intellectual disabilities in Scotlands Census, 2011, and a 5% sample of other adults, to COVID-19 test results (Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland), hospitalisations (Scottish Morbidity Record 01), and deaths (National Records of Scotland).

SettingGeneral population; 24th January 2020 - 15th August 2020

ParticipantsSuccessful linkage of 94.8% provided data on 17,173 adults with, and 195,859 without, intellectual disabilities.

OutcomesCrude rates of COVID-19 infection, severe infection (hospitalisation/death), mortality, and case fatality; age-, sex- and deprivation-standardised severe infection and mortality ratios; annual all-cause mortality for 2020 and 2015-2019.

ResultsAdults with intellectual disabilities had higher rates of COVID-19 infection (957/100,000 versus 513/100,000); severe infection (549/100,000 versus 237/100,000); mortality (259/100,000 versus 114/100,000); and case-fatality (30% versus 24%). Poorer COVID-19 outcomes remained after standardising for age, sex and deprivation: standardised severe infection ratio 2.59 (95% CI 1.80, 3.39) and mortality ratio 3.20 (95% CI 2.16, 4.25). These were higher among 55-64 year olds: 7.12 (95% CI 3.73, 10.50) and 16.16 (95% CI7.69, 24.63) respectively. Among adults with intellectual disabilities, all-cause mortality was only slightly higher in 2020 than the previous five years: standardised mortality ratios 2.49 (95% CI 2.17, 2.81) and 2.38 (95% CI 2.26, 2.49) respectively.

ConclusionsAdults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to be infected with COVID-19, and had worse outcomes once infected, particularly those under 65 years. Non-pharmaceutical interventions directed at formal and informal carers are essential to reduce transmission and all adults with intellectual disabilities should be immediately prioritised for vaccination regardless of age.

What this study addsO_LICompared with general population adults, adults with intellectual disabilities were almost twice as likely to become infected with COVID-19, 2.3 times as likely to have severe infection, 2.3 times as likely to have COVID-19 mortality, and had 25% higher COVID-19 case-fatality.
C_LIO_LIAfter standardising for age, sex and deprivation, people with intellectual disabilities were 3.2 times more at risk of covid-19 mortality and 2.6 times more at risk of severe infection relative to those with no intellectual disabilities
C_LIO_LICompared with general population adults, adults with intellectual disabilities had poorer outcomes among non-elderly age-groups particularly those aged 55-65 years, men, and those living in less-deprived neighbourhoods.
C_LIO_LINon-pharmaceutical initiatives are important for carers and care-provider organisations, and adults with intellectual disabilities should be prioritised in the national rollouts of COVID-19 vaccination programmes, regardless of age, sex, or neighbourhood deprivation.

479,Modelling the impact of reopening schools in early 2021 in the presence of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant and with roll-out of vaccination against COVID-19,"BackgroundFollowing the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK in late 2020 and the emergence of the new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, B.1.1.7, a third national lockdown was imposed from January 5, 2021. Following the decline of COVID-19 cases over the remainder of January 2021, it is important to assess the conditions under which reopening schools from early March is likely to lead to resurgence of the epidemic. This study models the impact of a partial national lockdown with social distancing measures enacted in communities and workplaces under different strategies of reopening schools from March 8, 2021 and compares it to the impact of continual full national lockdown remaining until April 19, 2021.

MethodsWe used our previously published model, Covasim, to model the emergence of B.1.1.7 over September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We extended the model to incorporate the impacts of the roll-out of a two-dose vaccine against COVID-19, assuming 200,000 daily doses of the vaccine in people 75 years or older with vaccination that offers 95% reduction in disease acquisition and 10% reduction of transmission blocking. We used the model, calibrated until January 25, 2021, to simulate the impact of a full national lockdown (FNL) with schools closed until April 19, 2021 versus four different partial national lockdown (PNL) scenarios with different elements of schooling open: 1) staggered PNL with primary schools and exam-entry years (years 11 and 13) returning on March 8, 2021 and the rest of the schools years on March 15, 2020; 2) full-return PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021; 3) primary-only PNL with primary schools and exam critical years (Y11 and Y13) going back only on March 8, 2021 with the rest of the secondary schools back on April 19, 2021 and 4) part-Rota PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021 with primary schools remaining open continuously but secondary schools on a two-weekly rota-system with years alternating between a fortnight of face-to-face and remote learning until April 19, 2021. Across all scenarios, we projected the number of new daily cases, cumulative deaths and effective reproduction number R until April 30, 2020.

ResultsOur calibration across different scenarios is consistent with the new variant B.1.1.7 being around 60% more transmissible. Strict social distancing measures, i.e. national lockdowns, are required to contain the spread of the virus and control the hospitalisations and deaths during January and February 2021. The national lockdown will reduce the number of cases by early March levels similar to those seen in October with R also falling and remaining below 1 during the lockdown. Infections start to increase when schools open but if other parts of society remain closed this resurgence is not sufficient to bring R above 1. Reopening primary schools and exam critical years only or having primary schools open continuously with secondary schools on rotas will lead to lower increases in cases and R than if all schools open. Under the current vaccination assumptions and across the set of scenarios considered, R would increase above 1 if society reopens simultaneously, simulated here from April 19, 2021.

FindingsOur findings suggest that stringent measures are necessary to mitigate the increase in cases and bring R below 1 over January and February 2021. It is plausible that a PNL with schools partially open from March 8, 2021 and the rest of the society remaining closed until April 19, 2021 may keep R below 1, with some increase evident in infections compared to continual FNL until April 19, 2021. Reopening society in mid-April, with the vaccination strategy we model, could push R above 1 and induce a surge in infections, but the effect of vaccination may be able to control this in future depending on the transmission blocking properties of the vaccines.",Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Cliff Kerr; Katherine Rosenfeld; Dina Mistry; William Waites; Daniel J Klein; Chris Bonell; Russell M Viner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251287,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251287,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
480,High School Sports During the CoVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact of Sport Participation on the Health of Adolescents,"ContextDuring the fall of 2020, some high schools across the US allowed their students to participate in interscholastic sports while others cancelled or postponed their sport programs due to concerns regarding CoVID19 transmission. It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of student athletes.

ObjectiveIdentify the impact of playing a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic on the health of student athletes.

DesignCross-sectional study.

SettingSample recruited via email.

Patients or Other Participants559 Wisconsin high school athletes (age=15.7+1.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP).

Main Outcome Measure(s)Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch.

RESULTSPLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p<0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p<0.001). PLY athletes reported higher (better) PFABS scores (mean: [95%CI]), (PLY=23.2[22.0,24.5], DNP=16.4[15.0,17.8], p <0.001) and higher (better) PedsQL total scores (PLY=88.4[85.9,90.9], DNP=79.6[76.8,82.4], p <0.001).

CONCLUSIONSAdolescent athletes who played a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as higher physical activity and quality of life scores compared to adolescent athletes who did not play a sport.

481,COVID-19 in pregnancy: characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women admitted to hospital because of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Nordic countries.,"IntroductionPopulation-based studies about the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) in pregnancy are few and have limited generalizability to the Nordic population and health care systems.

Material and methodThis study examines pregnant women with COVID-19 in the five Nordic countries. Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test 14 days or fewer prior to the admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID-19 related.

ResultsIn the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women needed hospital care due to COVID-19. The rate of admission due to COVID-19 was 0.4 per 1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland, and Norway and 3.8 per 1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID-19 were more frequently obese (P < 0.001) and had migrant background (P < 0.001) compared to the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Preterm delivery (n=12, 25%, P < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n=21, 43,8%, P < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID-19 compared to the women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported.

ConclusionsThe risk of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries. National public health policies appear to have had an impact on the rates of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy. Nordic collaboration is important in collecting robust data and assessing rare outcomes.

482,Patterns of COVID-19 pandemic dynamics following deployment of a broad national immunization program,"Studies on the real-life impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine, recently authorized for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are urgently needed. Here, we analysed the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization in Israel following a vaccination campaign initiated on December 20th, 2020. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data originating from the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) from March 2020 to February 2021. In order to distill the possible effect of the vaccinations from other factors, including a third lockdown imposed in Israel on January 2021, we compared the time-dependent changes in number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations between (1) individuals aged 60 years and older, eligible to receive the vaccine earlier and younger individuals (0-59 years old); (2) early-vaccinated cities compared to late-vaccinated cities; (3) early-vaccinated geographical statistical areas (GSAs) compared to late-vaccinated GSAs; and (4) the current lockdown versus the previous lockdown, imposed on September 2020. By February 6th 2021, 45.3% and 29.7% of the entire Israeli population (89.9% and 80% of individuals older than 60 years old) received the first dose or both doses of the vaccine, respectively, or recovered from COVID-19. In mid-January, the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalization started to decline, with a larger and earlier decrease among older individuals. This trend was more evident in early-vaccinated compared to late-vaccinated cities. Such a pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown. Our analysis demonstrates evidence for the real-life effectiveness of a national vaccination campaign in Israel on the pandemic dynamics. This report reflects a snapshot of a fast-changing situation. However, we believe our findings have major public health implications in the struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic, including the publics perception of the need for and benefit of nationwide vaccination campaigns.

483,A potent bispecific nanobody protects hACE2 mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via intranasal administration,"The dramatically expanding COVID-19 needs multiple effective countermeasures. Neutralizing antibodies are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. A number of neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) were reported for their in vitro activities. However, in vivo protection of these nanobodies was not reported in animal models. In the current report, we characterized several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from a screen of an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibited picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and 15 circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs were engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15, a novel trimer constituted of three Nbs, was constructed to be bispecific for human serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited sub-ng/ml neutralization potency against the wild-type and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo. In addition, we showed that intranasal administration of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 provided 100% protection for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection in transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is a potential candidate for both prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory administration.

484,High Throughput Nanopore Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Genomes from Patient Samples,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, causing a potentially lethal respiratory viral infection. By early 2020, the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, had spread globally, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The infection and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 make it amenable to tracking movement and evolution by viral genome sequencing. Efforts to develop effective public health policies, therapeutics, or vaccines to treat or prevent COVID-19 are also expected to benefit from tracking mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we describe a set of comprehensive working protocols, from viral RNA extraction to analysis using online visualization tools, for high throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes using a MinION instrument. This set of protocols should serve as a reliable  how-to reference for generating quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with ARTIC primer sets and next-generation nanopore sequencing technology.

485,"Transformations, Comparisons, and Analysis of Down to Up Protomer States of Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 Prefusion Spike Protein Including the UK Variant B.1.1.7","Monitoring and strategic response to variants in SARS-CoV-2 represents a considerable challenge in the current pandemic, as well as potentially future viral outbreaks of similar magnitude. In particular mutations and deletions involving the virions prefusion Spike protein has significant potential impact on vaccines and therapeutics that utilize this key structural viral protein in their mitigation strategies. In this study, we have demonstrated how dominant energetic landscape mappings (""glue points"") coupled with sequence alignment information can potentially identify or flag key residue mutations and deletions associated with variants. Surprisingly, we also found excellent homology of stabilizing residue glue points across the lineage of {beta} coronavirus Spike proteins, and we have termed this as ""sequence homologous glue points"". In general, these flagged residue mutations and/or deletions are then computationally studied in detail using all-atom biocomputational molecular dynamics over approximately one microsecond in order to ascertain structural and energetic changes in the Spike protein associated variants. Specifically, we examined both a theoretically-based triple mutant and the so called UK or B.1.1.7 variant. For the theoretical triple mutant, we demonstrated through Alanine mutations, which help ""unglue"" key residue-residue interactions, that these three key stabilizing residues could cause the transition of Down to Up protomer states, where the Up protomer state allows binding of the prefusion Spike protein to hACE2 host cell receptors, whereas the Down state is believed inaccessible. For the B.1.1.7 variant, we demonstrated the critical importance of D614G and N5017 on the structure and binding of the Spike protein associated variant. In particular, we had previously identified D614 as a key glue point in the inter-protomer stabilization of the Spike protein. Other mutations and deletions associated with this variant did not appear to play a pivotal role in structure or binding changes. The mutant D614G is a structure breaking Glycine mutation demonstrating a relatively large hinge angle and highly stable Up conformation in agreement with previous studies. In addition, we demonstrate that the mutation N501Y may significantly increase the Spike protein binding to hACE2 cell receptors through its interaction with Y41 of hACE2 forming a potentially strong hydrophobic residue binding pair. We note that these two key mutations, D614G and N501Y, are also found in the so-called South African (SA; B.1.351) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies along these lines are therefore aimed at mapping glue points to residue mutations and deletions of associated prefusion Spike protein variants in order to help direct and optimize efforts aimed at the mitigation of this deadly virion.",michael h peters; Oscar Basidas; Daniel Kokron; Christopher E.

N-protein is dimeric and consists of two folded domains with nucleic acid (NA) binding sites, surrounded by intrinsically disordered regions that promote liquid-liquid phase separation. Here we use biophysical tools to study N-protein interactions with oligonucleotides of different length, examining the size, composition, secondary structure, and energetics of the resulting states. We observe formation of supramolecular clusters or nuclei preceding growth into phase-separated droplets. Short hexanucleotide NA forms compact 2:2 N-protein/NA complexes with reduced disorder. Longer oligonucleotides expose additional N-protein interactions and multi-valent protein-NA interactions, which generate higher-order mixed oligomers and simultaneously promote growth of droplets. Phase separation is accompanied by a significant increase in protein secondary structure, different from that caused by initial NA binding, which may contribute to the assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles within molecular condensates.",Huaying Zhao; Di Wu; Ai Nguyen; Yan Li; Regina Ad&atildeo; Eugene Valkov; George H Patterson; Grzegorz Piszczek; Peter Schuck,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430344,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430344,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
487,GABA administration limits viral replication and pneumonitis in a mouse model of COVID-19,"Despite the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, serious illness and death induced by coronavirus infection will remain a global health burden because of vaccination hesitancy, possible virus mutations, and the appearance of novel coronaviruses. Accordingly, there is a need for new approaches to limit severe illness stemming from coronavirus infections. Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors for GABA (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We previously showed that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity and death rates in mice following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1) which provides a potentially lethal model of COVID-19. Here, we report that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary coronavirus replication. Histopathological analysis revealed that GABA treatment reduced lung inflammatory infiltrates and damages. Since GABA is safe for human consumption, inexpensive, and available worldwide, it is a promising candidate to help treat COVID-19.",Jide Tian; Blake Middleton; Daniel L Kaufman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430446,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430446,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
488,SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Risk from sports Equipment (STRIKE),"OBJECTIVESTo investigate the potential of shared sporting equipment as transmission vectors of SARS-CoV-2 during the reintroduction of sports such as soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and gymnastics.

SETTINGLaboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study

INTERVENTIONSTen different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREThe primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points.

RESULTSAt one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission.

CONCLUSIONSThis study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.

O_TEXTBOXWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LITransmission of SARS-CoV-2 between individuals playing sport may be via respiratory droplets when in close proximity to an infected person.
C_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 remains viable on a variety of surfaces resulting in recommendations to reduce the sharing of sports equipment such as tennis balls when sports were re-opened.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIThe recoverable SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduces exponentially with mean viral load of all materials less than 1% of the original inoculum after 1 minute.
C_LIO_LIThe type of material has a significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 transfer, with less virus transferred from porous materials such as bovine leather or nylon woven cloth.
C_LIO_LIPolicies on infection control measures in sport may be better directed towards areas other than reducing the sharing of sports equipment.

489,Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant,"IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with the occurrence since summer 2020 of several viral variants that overlapped or succeeded each other in time. Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477N substitution in this RBD.

Materials and methodsWe aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant.

ResultsAll 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93%) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 1,585/2,889 patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6%) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR.

DiscussionOur in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in more than half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.",Marielle Bedotto; Pierre-Edouard Fournier; Linda Houhamdi; Anthony LEVASSEUR; Jeremy Delerce; Lucine Pinault; Abdou Padane; Amanda CHAMIEH; Herve TISSOT-DUPONT; Philippe BROUQUI; Cheikh Sokhna; Eid Azar; Rachid Saile; Souleymane Mboup; Idir Bitam; Philippe Colson; Didier Raoult,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
490,TOP-Plus is a Versatile Biosensor Platform for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Durability,"BackgroundThere is a concern that low initial SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in individuals may drop to undetectable levels within months after infection. Although this may raise concerns over long term immunity, both the antibody levels and avidity of the antibody-antigen interaction should be examined to understand the quality of the antibody response.

MethodsA testing-on-a-probe ""plus"" panel (TOP-Plus) was developed, which included a newly developed avidity assay built into the previously described SARS-CoV-2 TOP assays that measured total antibody (TAb), surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb), IgM and IgG on a versatile biosensor platform. TAb and SNAb levels were compared with avidity in previously infected individuals at 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection in paired samples from 80 COVID-19 patients.

ResultsThe newly designed avidity assay in this TOP panel correlated well with a reference Bio-Layer Interferometry avidity assay (R=0.88). The imprecision of the TOP avidity assay was less than 9%. Although TAb and neutralization activity (by SNAb) decreased between 1.3 and 6.2 months post infection, the antibody avidity increased significantly (P < 0.0001).

ConclusionThis highly precise and versatile TOP-Plus panel with the ability to measure SARS-CoV-2 TAb, SNAb, IgG and IgM antibody levels and avidity of individual sera on one sensor can become a valuable asset in monitoring not only SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, but also the status of individuals COVID-19 vaccination response.",Sabrina E Racine-Brzostek; Mohsen Karbaschi; Christian Gaebler; PJ Klasse; Jim Yee; Marina Caskey; He S Yang; Ying Hao; Amy Chadburn; Yuanyuan Shi; Robert Zuk; Michel C Nussenzweig; Melissa M Cushing; Zhen Zhao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
491,"COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions August to December 2020, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany: a study of index cases and close contact cohorts","BackgroundThe lack of precise estimates on transmission risk hampers rational decisions on closure of educational institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsSecondary attack rates (SARs) for schools and day-care centres were calculated using data from state-wide mandatory notification of SARS-CoV-2 index cases in educational institutions and information on routine contact tracing and PCR-testing.

FindingsFrom August to December 2020, every sixth of overall 784 independent index cases caused a transmission in educational institutions (risk 0{middle dot}17, 95% CI 0{middle dot}14-0{middle dot}19). In a subgroup, monitoring of 14,594 institutional high-risk contacts (89% PCR-tested) of 441 index cases revealed 196 secondary cases (SAR 1{middle dot}34%, 1{middle dot}16-1{middle dot}54). Transmission was more likely from teachers than from students/children (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 3{middle dot}17, 1{middle dot}79-5{middle dot}59), and from index cases in day-care centres (IRR 3{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}76-5{middle dot}91) than from those in secondary schools. In 748 index cases, teachers caused four times more secondary cases than children (1{middle dot}08 vs. 0{middle dot}25 secondary cases per index, IRR 4{middle dot}39, 2{middle dot}67-7{middle dot}21). This difference was mainly due to a large number of teacher-to-teacher transmissions in day-care centres (mean number of secondary cases 0.66) and a very low number of student/child-to-teacher transmissions in schools (mean number of secondary cases 0.004).

InterpretationIn educational institutions, the risk of infection for contacts to a confirmed COVID-19 case is one percent, but varies depending on type of institution and index case. Hygiene measures and vaccination targeting the day-care setting and teacher-to-teacher transmission are priorities in reducing the burden of infection and may promote educational justice during the pandemic.

FundingNo particular funding was received for this study.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on Jan 27, 2021, without any language restrictions for all articles in which the title or abstract contained the search terms ""COVID 19"" or ""corona"", and ""school"", ""education*"", or ""daycare"", and ""transmission"", and ""risk"", ""attack rate"", or ""SAR"", and screened 175 results for original research or reviews on COVID-19 transmission risk in the educational setting. Following a similar strategy, we also searched Google Scholar, SSRN, medRxiv, and the reference lists of identified literature. We found five cohort studies on transmission risk looking at overall 171 index cases and their 6,910 contact persons in Australian, Italian, Irish, Singaporean, and German schools and reporting attack rates between 0% and 3% percent. These five studies were conducted before October 2020 and thus looked at COVID-19 transmission risk in schools before the second wave in Europe.

A number of modelling studies from the first wave of COVID-19 provide inconclusive guidance to policy makers. While two publications, one from several countries and one from Switzerland, concluded that school closures contributed markedly to the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and individual mobility, two other studies, one using cross-country data and one from Japan rated school closures among the least effective measures to reduce COVID-19 incidence rates.

Added value of this studyBased on a large data set that emerged from the current public health practice in Germany, which incorporates routine PCR-testing during active follow-up of asymptomatic high-risk contacts to index cases, this study provides a precise estimate of the true underlying SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in schools and day-care centres. Its analysis also allows for a meaningful examination of differences in the risk of transmission with respect to the characteristics of the index case. We found that the individual risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 among high-risk contacts in the educational setting is 1.3%, but that this risk rises to 3.2% when the index case is a teacher and to 2.5% when the index case occurs in a day-care centre. Furthermore, we could show that, on average, teacher index cases produced about four times as many secondary cases as student/child index cases. Despite the relatively small proportion of teachers among index cases (20%), our study of transmission pathways revealed that the majority of all secondary cases (54%), and the overwhelming majority of secondary cases in teachers (78%) were caused by teacher index cases. Of note, most cases of teacher-to-teacher transmission (85%) occurred in day-care centres.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn this setting, where preventative measures are in place and COVID-19 incidence rates were rising sharply in the population, we found a low and stable transmission risk in educational institutions over time, which provides evidence for the effectiveness of current preventative measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in schools. The identification of a substantial teacher-to-teacher transmission risk in day-care, but a clearly mitigated child/student-to-teacher transmission risk in schools, indicates the need to shift the focus to hygiene among day-care teachers, including infection prevention during staff-meetings and in break rooms. These findings also strongly support the re-prioritization of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 to educational staff in day-care.",Anja Schoeps; Dietmar Hoffmann; Claudia Tamm; Bianca Vollmer; Sabine Haag; Tina Kaffenberger; Kimberly Ferguson-Beiser; Berit Kohlhase-Griebel; Silke Basenach; Andrea Missal; Katja Hoefling; Harald Michels; Anett Schall; Holger Kappes; Manfred Vogt; Klaus Jahn; Till Baernighausen; Philipp Zanger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250670,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250670,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
492,Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 stains harbouring the signature mutations of both A2a and A3 clade,"SARS-CoV-2 strains with both high transmissibility and potential to cause asymptomatic infection is expected to gain selective advantage over other circulating strains having either high transmissibility or ability to trigger asymptomatic infection. The D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein, the characteristic mutation A2a clade, has been associated with high transmissibility, whereas the A3 clade specific mutation L37F in NSP6 protein has been linked with asymptomatic infection. In this study, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected during January, 2020 to December, 2020 from all across the world for the presence of D614G and L37F mutations. Out of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 strains analysed, 14, 598 (3.87%) were found to harbour both the D614G and L37F mutations. Majority of these double mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified in Europe (11097) followed by North America (1915), Asia (980), Oceania (242), Africa (219), and South America (145). Geographical root surveillance revealed their first emergence during February-March in all the six continents. Temporal prevalence analysis from February, 2020 to December, 2020 showed a gradual upsurge in their frequencies worldwide, which strongly demonstrated the adaptive selection of these double mutants. Evolutionary analysis depicted that these double mutants emerged as a new clade in the dendrogram (named as A2a/3), and were sub-divided into four distinct clusters (Cluster I, II, III and IV) according to different sets of coexisting mutations. The frequency distribution pattern showed the global predominance of cluster III (41.42%), followed by cluster IV (23.31%), cluster II (21.02%) and cluster I (14.25%). Overall, our study highlighted the emergence of a unique phylogenetic clade encompassing the double-mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains which may provide a fitness advantage during course of virus evolution.",Rakesh Sarkar; Dr. Anindita Banerjee; Shanta Dutta; Dr. Mamta Chawla-Sarkar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251117,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251117,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
493,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Tamil Nadu in October-November 2020,"A population-representative serological study was conducted in all districts of the state of Tamil Nadu (population 72 million), India, in October-November 2020. State-level seroprevalence was 31.6%. However, this masks substantial variation across the state. Seroprevalence ranged from just 11.1% in The Nilgris to 51.0% in Perambalur district. Seroprevalence in urban areas (36.9%) was higher than in rural areas (26.9%). Females (30.8%) had similar seroprevalence to males (30.3%). However, working age populations (age 40-49: 31.6%) have significantly higher seroprevalence than the youth (age 18-29: 30.7%) or elderly (age 70+: 25.8%). Estimated seroprevalence implies that at least 22.6 million persons were infected by the end of November, roughly 36 times the number of confirmed cases.

494,Inhaled budesonide in the treatment of early COVID-19 illness: a randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundMultiple early hospital cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed that patients with chronic respiratory disease were significantly under-represented. We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids was responsible for this finding and tested if inhaled glucorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19 illness.

MethodsWe conducted a randomised, open label trial of inhaled budesonide, compared to usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment.

Results146 patients underwent randomisation. For the per protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in 10 participants and 1 participant in the usual care and budesonide arms respectively (difference in proportion 0.131, p=0.004). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was 8. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide arm compared to the usual care arm (median of 7 days versus 8 days respectively, logrank test p=0.007). Proportion of days with a fever and proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide arm. Fewer participants randomised to budesonide had persistent symptoms at day 14 and day 28 compared to participants receiving usual care.

ConclusionEarly administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery following early COVID-19 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe majority of interventions studied for the COVID-19 pandemic are focused on hospitalised patients. Widely available and broadly relevant interventions for mild COVID-19 are urgently needed.

Added value of this studyIn this open label randomised controlled trial, inhaled budesonide, when given to adults with early COVID-19 illness, reduces the likelihood of requiring urgent care, emergency department consultation or hospitalisation. There was also a quicker resolution of fever, a known poor prognostic marker in COVID-19 and a faster self-reported and questionnaire reported symptom resolution. There were fewer participants with persistent COVID-19 symptoms at 14 and 28 days after budesonide therapy compared to usual care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe STOIC trial potentially provides the first easily accessible effective intervention in early COVID-19. By assessing health care resource utilisation, the study provides an exciting option to help with the worldwide pressure on health care systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

495,DrugWAS: Leveraging drug-wide association studies to facilitate drug repurposing for COVID-19,"ImportanceThere is an unprecedented need to rapidly identify safe and effective treatments for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ObjectiveTo systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as potential treatment for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBased on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data, drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on COVID-19 disease outcomes.

ExposuresPatient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in structured format.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause of death was selected as primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes.

ResultsThe study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized, 82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%) died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids), methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and fluticasone.

496,Using Machine Learning to Predict Mortality for COVID-19 Patients on Day Zero in the ICU,"RationaleGiven the expanding number of COVID-19 cases and the potential for upcoming waves of infection, there is an urgent need for early prediction of the severity of the disease in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to optimize treatment strategies.

ObjectivesEarly prediction of mortality using machine learning based on typical laboratory results and clinical data registered on the day of ICU admission.

MethodsWe studied retrospectively 263 COVID-19 ICU patients. To find parameters with the highest predictive values, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Pearson chi-squared tests were used. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) algorithms were utilized to build classification models. The impact of each marker on the RF model predictions was studied by implementing the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation technique (LIME-SP).

ResultsAmong 66 documented parameters, 15 factors with the highest predictive values were identified as follows: gender, age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean cell hemoglobin along with a history of neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders. Our RF model can predict patients outcomes with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 75%.

ConclusionsThe most decisive variables in our model were increased levels of BUN, lowered albumin levels, increased creatinine, INR, and RDW along with gender and age. Complete blood count parameters were also crucial for some patients. Considering the importance of early triage decisions, this model can be a useful tool in COVID-19 ICU decision-making.",Elham Jamshidi; Amirhossein Asgary; Nader Tavakoli; Alireza Zali; Hadi Esmaily; Seyed Hamid Jamaldini; Amir Daaee; Amirhesam Babajani; Mohammad Ali Sendani Kashi; Masoud Jamshidi; Sahand Rahi; Nahal Mansouri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
497,Symptoms of COVID-19 infection and magnitude of antibody response in a large community-based study,"BackgroundThe majority of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic with management in the home. Little is known about the frequency of specific symptoms in the general population, and how symptoms predict the magnitude of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe quantified IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in home-collected dried blood spot samples from 3,365 adults participating in a community-based seroprevalence study in the city of Chicago, USA, collected between June 24 and November 11, 2020.

Results17.8% of the sample was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. A cluster of symptoms (loss of sense of smell or taste, fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headache) was associated with stronger anti-RBD IgG responses among the seropositives. 39.2% of infections were asymptomatic, and 2 or fewer symptoms were reported for 66.7% of infections. Total number of symptoms was positively but weakly associated with IgG response: Median anti-RBD IgG was 0.95 ug/mL for individuals with 3 or more symptoms, in comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for asymptomatic infections.

ConclusionWe document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection in a large community-based cohort, and relatively low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the general population of previously exposed individuals.",Thomas W McDade; Joshua Schrock; Richard D'Aquila; Brian Mustanski; Nanette Benbow; Lauren Vaught; Nina Reiser; Matt Velez; Ryan Hsieh; Daniel Ryan; Rana Saber; ELIZABETH MCNALLY; Alexis R.

498,Longitudinal serology in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India - a prospective cohort study,"Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are now widely available, but there are few data on longitudinal serology in large cohorts, particularly from low-and middle-income countries. We established an ongoing prospective cohort of 3840 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals in the Delhi-National Capital Region of India, to document clinical and immunological characteristics during illness and convalescence. The IgG responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0-7, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates in the post-infection windows of 0-7 days, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks were 46%, 84.7% and 85.3% respectively (n=782). The proportion with a serological response increased with severity of COVID-19 disease. All participants with severe disease, 89.6% with mild to moderate infection and 77.3% of asymptomatic participants had IgG antibodies to the RBD antigen. The threshold values in the nasopharyngeal viral RNA RT-PCR in a subset of asymptomatic and symptomatic seroconverters were comparable (p value: 0.48), with similar results among non-seroconverters (p value: 0.16) (n=169). This is the first report of longitudinal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a period of ten weeks from South Asia. The low seropositivity in asymptomatic participants and differences between assays highlight the importance of contextualizing the understanding of population serosurveys.

SummaryWe measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NC protein IgG in a multi-hospital-based prospective cohort from northern India up to ten weeks post-infection.

An increased incidence of staff presentations of occupational dermatitis in our institutions prompted the establishment of a drop-in access daily hand dermatitis clinic.

Objectiveto document the incidence and severity of cases of occupational dermatitis arising in healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic, and to reduce the impact of this with early assessment and treatment.

Methodsan open-access daily staff clinic run by dermatologists was established, and demographic and clinical data collected from each clinical encounter.

Results532 staff attended the clinic over a 6 week period. This compared to 7 staff presenting to occupational health over the same period in 2019. The majority were females 81%,and ward based 51%. ITU and A&E staff represented 15%. The prevalence of occupational hand dermatitis was 88%. 52% were classed as mild, 26% as moderate 26% and 9% severe/very severe.

The model is validated with the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and the number of patients in ICUs and ventilation units as reported by Turkey Department of Health for the period March 11 through May 30 when the nationwide lockdown is in order. COVID-19 interventions in Turkey are incorporated into the model to detect the future trend of the outbreak accurately. The lockdown is lifted on June 1, and the model is modified to include a time dependent transmission rate which is linked to the effective reproduction number [R]t through basic reproduction number [R]0. The modified model captures the changing dynamics and peaks of the outbreak successfully.

PurposeThis study investigated changes in COVID-19 prevention behaviours from April-July 2020, and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours.

Methods1,843 participants in Australia completed a national COVID-19 survey in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Principal components analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours. Multivariable regression models explored baseline (April) correlates of behaviour in June (a period of low community transmission) and July (a period of increasing community transmission).

ResultsOn average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). PCA identified two behaviour types:  distancing (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and  hygiene (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing declined each month (ps<.001), whereas hygiene remained relatively stable. For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated with adherence in June and July (ps<0.05). For hygiene, the only significant correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that ones actions could prevent infection of family members (p<.001).

ConclusionsHigh adherence to COVID-19 prevention behaviours were reported; however, distancing behaviours tended to decrease over time. Belief in social responsibility may be an important aspect to consider in encouraging distancing behaviours. Different policy approaches may be needed for different behavioural categories.",Julie Ayre; Erin Cvejic; Kirsten J McCaffery; Tessa Copp; Samuel Cornell; Rachael H Dodd; Kristen Pickles; Carys Batcup; Jennifer MJ Isautier; Brooke Nickel; Thomas Dakin; Carissa Bonner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251165,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
502,Impact of school closures on the health and well-being of primary school children in Wales UK; a routine data linkage study using the HAPPEN survey (2018-2020).,"IntroductionIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, school closures were implemented across the United Kingdom. This study aimed to explore the impact of school closures on childrens health by comparing health and wellbeing outcomes collected during school closures (April - June 2020) with data from the same period in 2019 and 2018.

MethodsData were collected online via the  HAPPEN At Home survey, which captured the typical health behaviours of children aged 8 - 11 years between April - June 2020. These data were compared with data in 2018 and 2019 also collected between April-June, from HAPPEN. Free school meal (FSM) status was used as a proxy for socio-economic deprivation. Analyses were repeated stratifying by FSM.

ResultsComparing responses between April - June in 2020 (n=1068), 2019 (n=1150) and 2018 (n=475), there were improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM ate less fruit and vegetables (21% (95%CI (5.7% to 37%)) and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity (13.03% (95%CI: 3.3% to 21.7%) and consumed more takeaways (16.3% (95%CI: 2%-30%)) during school closures.

ConclusionThis study suggests that schools play an important role in reducing inequalities in physical health. The physical health (e.g. physical activity and diet) of children eligible for FSM may be impacted by prolonged school closures.

What is already known on this subject?In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, by mid-March 2020, 138 countries had implemented national school closures to reduce the number of social contacts between pupils, therefore interrupting the transmission of COVID-19 as part of pandemic plans. UNESCO warned that the global scale and speed of the educational disruption would be unparalleled. There is an ongoing debate with regard to the effectiveness of schools closures on transmission rates, but the fact schools are closed for a long period of time could have detrimental impacts on pupils physical and mental health.

This study provides evidence of any differences in the health and wellbeing of children prior to and during the COVID-19 enforced lockdown and school closures between March and June 2020. These findings could have a significant impact for the future and support schools to better understand their pupils physical, psychological, emotional and social health. It also contributes to a significant literature gap regarding the impact of school closures on school-aged children.

What this study adds?Improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing were observed in general for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM reported eating less fruit and vegetables and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity and consumed more takeaways during school closures. These trends are not evident among children not on FSM. All children reported improvements in wellbeing during lockdown especially on the happiness with family measure.

Overall, findings suggest schools help to reduce inequalities in physical health for socio-economically deprived children. During school closures children from deprived backgrounds are likely to have poorer physical health (e.g. less time spent doing physical activities and poorer diet) and this is not observed in children who are not in receipt of FSM. This research suggests that school closures will result in widening health inequalities and when schools return measures will need to be in place to readdress the widened gap in physical health.",Michaela James; Emily Marchant; Margaret A Defeyter; Jayne V Woodside; Sinead Brophy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
503,Enhancing Food Security for Families Vulnerable to COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some of the underlying inequities in our society. Vulnerable and low-income communities who have typically struggled with food insecurity have been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To make matters worse, transit dependent households in the City of Detroit that rely on SNAP benefits from the government have a 54% probability of not having internet access, reducing the possibility of online food delivery. Thus, the motivation for the Detroit Food Delivery Pilot Program, a prepared meal delivery service for food insecure households during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, the City had aided 350 households; over 1,000 unique individuals and has served over 90,000 meals. This had all been made possible through the engagement of 575 volunteers, volunteering over 6,850 delivery miles. Our team helped to identify the magnitude and the needs of the Citys food insecure population; then partnered with the City of Detroit to modify existing food programs to address the crisis, and finally, assessed the impact of the program on the target population. Our analysis revealed that approximately 20,800 households will be classified as food insecure in Detroit and only a fraction of this population is benefitting from the food delivery pilot program. However, on average, the concerns about food sufficiency have abated appreciably from the surveys analyzed. Responses from the beneficiaries of the food delivery pilot program were positive though concerns about the travel behavior of individuals, particularly those from COVID-19 positive households remain.",Tayo Fabusuyi; Aditi Misra; Jon Martinez; Andong Chen; Vivian Jiang; H.

504,Staff-Pupil SARS-CoV-2 Infection Pathways in Schools: A Population Level Linked Data Approach,"BackgroundBetter understanding of the role that children and school staff play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to guide policy development on controlling infection whilst minimising disruption to childrens education and wellbeing.

MethodsOur national e-cohort (n=500,779) study used anonymised linked data for pupils, staff and associated households linked via educational settings. We estimated the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff and pupils over the period August - December 2020, dependent on measures of recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational settings.

ResultsThe total number of cases in a school was not associated with a subsequent increase in the risk of testing positive (Staff OR per case 0.92, 95%CI 0.85, 1.00; Pupils OR per case 0.98, 95%CI 0.93, 1.02). Amongst pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased risk of testing positive (OR per case 1.12, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.15). These effects were adjusted for a range of demographic covariates, and in particular any known cases within the same household, which had the strongest association with testing positive (Staff OR 39.86, 95%CI 35.01, 45.38, pupil OR 9.39, 95%CI 8.94 - 9.88).

ConclusionsIn a national school cohort, the odds of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not significantly increased in the 14-day period after case detection in the school. However, pupils were found to be at increased risk, following cases appearing within their own year group, where most of their contacts occur. Strong mitigation measures over the whole of the study period may have reduced wider spread within the school environment.

505,A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic,"The effective reproduction number Reff is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic.

In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted with Bayesian inference (PMCMC) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland.

This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data, without any specific hypothesis on its evolution. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its Reff(t). In this way, we can appropriately assess the effect of the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland.",Bernard Cazelles; Clara Champagne; Benjamin Nguyen Van Yen; Catherine Comiskey; Elisabeta Vergu; Benjamin Roche,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
506,Mapping internet activity in Australian cities during COVID-19 lockdown: how occupational factors drive inequality,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence has accumulated that movement restrictions enacted to combat virus spread produce disparate consequences along socioeconomic lines. One explanation for this differential impact is the distribution of people into occupations that can be performed from home and may provide greater financial security. However, little is known about the nature and scale of shifting home-based work patterns and their geographic distribution, despite this being a likely determinant of the success of geographically defined COVID-19 lockdown strategies. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure employment are better able to adapt to mobility restrictions, due to common occupational factors. In the context of two Australian urban centres, we test this hypothesis by analysing changes to home-based internet usage and quantify the relationship between area-level measures of population income security, the ability to perform job requirements remotely, and the degree of transition to home-based work during COVID-19. Our analysis confirms that financial security in Australia is geographically clustered and concentrated. Income security is also correlated with increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown, and home-based work patterns that persist post-lockdown. Our findings suggest that geographic diversity in preparedness for government-imposed restrictions should be factored into response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas.",Cameron Zachreson; Erika Martino; Martin Tomko; Freya M Shearer; Rebecca Bentley; Nicholas Geard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
507,Development and validation of an algorithm to estimate the risk of severe complications of COVID-19 to prioritise vaccination,"ObjectiveTo develop an algorithm (sCOVID) to predict the risk of severe complications of COVID- 19 in a community-dwelling population to optimise vaccination scenarios.

DesignPopulation based cohort study

Setting264 Dutch general practices contributing to the NL-COVID database

Participants6074 people aged 0-99 diagnosed with COVID-19

Main outcome measuresSevere complications (hospitalisation, institutionalisation, death). The algorithm was developed from a training dataset comprising 70% of the patients and validated in the remaining 30%. Potential predictor variables included age, sex, a chronic co-morbidity score (CCS) based on risk factors for COVID-19 complications as defined by the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), obesity, neighborhood deprivation score (NDS), first or second COVID wave, and confirmation test. Six different population vaccination scenarios were explored: 1) random (naive), 2) random for persons above 60 years (60plus), 3) oldest patients first in age bands of five years (oldest first), 4) target population of the annual influenza vaccination program (influenza) and 5) those 25-65 years of age first (worker), and 6) risk-based using the prediction algorithm (sCOVID). For each vaccination strategy the amount of vaccinations needed to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was calculated.

ResultsSevere complications were reported in 243 (4.8%) people with 59 (20.3%) nursing home admissions, 181 (62.2%) hospitalisations and 51 (17.5%) deaths. The algorithm included age, sex, CCS, NDS, wave, and confirmation test with a c statistic of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94) in the validation set. Applied to different vaccination scenarios, the proportion of people needed to be vaccinated to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was 67.5%, 50.0%, 26.1%, 16.0%, 10.0%, and 8.4% for the worker, naive, infuenza, 60plus, oldest first, and sCOVID scenarios respectively.

ConclusionCOVID-19 related severe complications will be reduced most efficiently when vaccinations are risk-based, prioritizing the highest risk group using the sCOVID algorithm. The vaccination scenario, prioritising oldest people in age bands of 5 years down to 60 years of age, performed second best. The sCOVID algorithm can readily be applied to identify persons with highest risks from data in the electronic health records of GPs.

508,Recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus AdC7 expressing dimeric tandem-repeat RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein protects mice against COVID-19,"A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have advanced into phase 3 trials, with three approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD) or dimeric tandem-repeat RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular (Th1-based) immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared with both AdC7-S and AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury. These results support AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429860,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429860,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,False
509,Impact of cobas PCR Media Freezing on SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Integrity and Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses,"SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is an important molecular biology tool performed to support many aspects of the response to the pandemic. Freezing of primary clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples and shipment to reference laboratories is usually required since RNA sequencing is rarely available in routine clinical microbiology laboratories where initial diagnosis and support to outbreak investigations occur. The cobas PCR Media transport medium developed by Roche facilitates high throughput analyses on cobas multianalyzer PCR platforms. There is no data on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after freezing and thawing of clinical samples in this transport medium, but potential denaturing of the molecular template could impair test results. Our objective was to compare the quality and results of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing when performed on fresh or frozen samples in cobas PCR Media. Viral whole genome sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. Genomic coverage and sequencing depth did not significantly differ between fresh and frozen samples (n=10). For samples with lower viral inoculum and PCR cycle threshold above 30, sequencing quality scores and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ either. Freezing of cobas PCR Media does not negatively affect the quality of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing results and it is therefore a suitable transport medium for outsourcing sequencing analyses to reference laboratories. Those results support secondary use of diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab material for viral sequencing without requirement for additional clinical samples.",Patrick Benoit; Cecile Tremblay; P.
