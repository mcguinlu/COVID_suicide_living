0,SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Risk from sports Equipment (STRIKE),"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential of shared sporting equipment as transmission vectors of SARS-CoV-2 during the reintroduction of sports such as soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and gymnastics. SETTING: Laboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study. INTERVENTIONS: Ten different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points. RESULTS: At one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.",Thomas Edwards; Grant A Kay; Ghaith Aljayyoussi; Sophie I Owen; Andy R Harland; Nicholas S Pierce; James D F Calder; Tom Fletcher; Emily R Adams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251127,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251127,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
1,Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant,"Introduction. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with the occurrence since summer 2020 of several viral variants that overlapped or succeeded each other in time. Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477N substitution in this RBD. Materials and methods. We aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant. Results. All 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93%) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 1,585/2,889 patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6%) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR. Discussion. Our in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in more than half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.",Marielle Bedotto; Pierre-Edouard Fournier; Linda Houhamdi; Anthony LEVASSEUR; Jeremy Delerce; Lucine Pinault; Abdou Padane; Amanda CHAMIEH; Herve TISSOT-DUPONT; Philippe BROUQUI; Cheikh Sokhna; Eid Azar; Rachid Saile; Souleymane Mboup; Idir Bitam; Philippe Colson; Didier Raoult,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
2,TOP-Plus is a Versatile Biosensor Platform for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Durability,"Background: There is a concern that low initial SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in individuals may drop to undetectable levels within months after infection. Although this may raise concerns over long term immunity, both the antibody levels and avidity of the antibody-antigen interaction should be examined to understand the quality of the antibody response. Methods: A testing-on-a-probe-plus panel (TOP-Plus) was developed, which included a newly developed avidity assay built into the previously described SARS-CoV-2 TOP assays that measured total antibody (TAb), surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb), IgM and IgG on a versatile biosensor platform. TAb and SNAb levels were compared with avidity in previously infected individuals at 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection in paired samples from 80 COVID-19 patients. Results: The newly designed avidity assay in this TOP panel correlated well with a reference Bio-Layer Interferometry avidity assay (R=0.88). The imprecision of the TOP avidity assay was less than 9%. Although TAb and neutralization activity (by SNAb) decreased between 1.3 and 6.2 months post infection, the antibody avidity increased significantly (P < 0.0001).",Sabrina E Racine-Brzostek; Mohsen Karbaschi; Christian Gaebler; PJ Klasse; Jim Yee; Marina Caskey; He S Yang; Ying Hao; Amy Chadburn; Yuanyuan Shi; Robert Zuk; Michel C Nussenzweig; Melissa M Cushing; Zhen Zhao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
3,"COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions August to December 2020, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany: a study of index cases and close contact cohorts","Background The lack of precise estimates on transmission risk hampers rational decisions on closure of educational institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Secondary attack rates (SARs) for schools and day-care centres were calculated using data from state-wide mandatory notification of SARS-CoV-2 index cases in educational institutions and additional information on routine contact tracing and PCR-testing. Findings From August to December 2020, every sixth of overall 784 independent index cases caused a transmission in educational institutions (risk 0.17, 95% CI 0.14-0.19). In a subgroup, monitoring of 14,594 institutional high-risk contacts (89% PCR-tested) of 441 index cases revealed 196 secondary cases (SAR 1.34%, 1.16-1.54). Transmission was more likely from teachers than from students/children (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 3.17, 1.79-5.59), and from index cases in day-care centres (IRR 3.23, 1.76-5.91) than from those in secondary schools. In 748 index cases, teachers caused four times more secondary cases than children (1.08 vs. 0.25 secondary cases per index, IRR 4.39, 2.67-7.21). This difference was mainly due to common transmission from teacher index cases to teacher contacts (mean secondary cases 0.56 teacher to teacher vs. 0.04 child to teacher, IRR 13.3, 6.6-26.7). Interpretation In educational institutions, the risk of contacts to a confirmed COVID-19 case for infection is one percent, but varies depending on type of institution and index case. Hygiene measures targeting the day-care setting and teacher-to-teacher transmission are priorities in reducing the burden of infection and may promote on-site education during the pandemic.",Anja Schoeps; Dietmar Hoffmann; Claudia Tamm; Bianca Vollmer; Sabine Haag; Tina Kaffenberger; Kimberly Ferguson-Beiser; Berit Kohlhase-Griebel; Silke Basenach; Andrea Missal; Katja Hoefling; Harald Michels; Anett Schall; Holger Kappes; Manfred Vogt; Klaus Jahn; Till Baernighausen; Philipp Zanger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250670,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250670,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
4,Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 stains harbouring the signature mutations of both A2a and A3 clade,"SARS-CoV-2 strains with both high transmissibility and potential to cause asymptomatic infection is expected to gain selective advantage over other circulating strains having either high transmissibility or ability to trigger asymptomatic infection. The D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein, the characteristic mutation A2a clade, has been associated with high transmissibility, whereas the A3 clade specific mutation L37F in NSP6 protein has been linked with asymptomatic infection. In this study, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected during January, 2020 to December, 2020 from all across the world for the presence of D614G and L37F mutations. Out of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 strains analysed, 14, 598 (3.87%) were found to harbour both the D614G and L37F mutations. Majority of these double mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified in Europe (11097) followed by North America (1915), Asia (980), Oceania (242), Africa (219), and South America (145). Geographical root surveillance revealed their first emergence during February-March in all the six continents. Temporal prevalence analysis from February, 2020 to December, 2020 showed a gradual upsurge in their frequencies worldwide, which strongly demonstrated the adaptive selection of these double mutants. Evolutionary analysis depicted that these double mutants emerged as a new clade in the dendrogram (named as A2a/3), and were sub-divided into four distinct clusters (Cluster I, II, III and IV) according to different sets of coexisting mutations. The frequency distribution pattern showed the global predominance of cluster III (41.42%), followed by cluster IV (23.31%), cluster II (21.02%) and cluster I (14.25%). Overall, our study highlighted the emergence of a unique phylogenetic clade encompassing the double-mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains which may provide a fitness advantage during course of virus evolution.",Rakesh Sarkar; Dr. Anindita Banerjee; Shanta Dutta; Dr. Mamta Chawla-Sarkar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251117,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251117,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
5,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Tamil Nadu in October-November 2020,"A population-representative serological study was conducted in all districts of the state of Tamil Nadu (population 72 million), India, in October-November 2020. State-level seroprevalence was 31.6%. However, this masks substantial variation across the state. Seroprevalence ranged from just 11.1% in The Nilgris to 51.0% in Perambalur district. Seroprevalence in urban areas (36.9%) was higher than in rural areas (26.9%). Females (30.8%) had similar seroprevalence to males (30.3%). However, working age populations (age 40-49: 31.6%) have significantly higher seroprevalence than the youth (age 18-29: 30.7%) or elderly (age 70+: 25.8%). Estimated seroprevalence implies that at least 22.6 million persons were infected by the end of November, roughly 36 times the number of confirmed cases. Estimated seroprevalence implies an infection fatality rate of 0.052%.",Anup Malani; Sabareesh Ramachandran; Vaidehi Tandel; Rajeswari Parasa; S Sudharshini; V. Prakash; Y. Yogananth; S. Raju; T.S.

6,Inhaled budesonide in the treatment of early COVID-19 illness: a randomised controlled trial,"Background Multiple early hospital cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed that patients with chronic respiratory disease were significantly under-represented. We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids was responsible for this finding and tested if inhaled glucorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19 illness. Methods We conducted a randomised, open label trial of inhaled budesonide, compared to usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment. Results 146 patients underwent randomisation. For the per protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in 10 participants and 1 participant in the usual care and budesonide arms respectively (difference in proportion 0.131, p=0.004). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was 8. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide arm compared to the usual care arm (median of 7 days versus 8 days respectively, logrank test p=0.007). Proportion of days with a fever and proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide arm. Fewer participants randomised to budesonide had persistent symptoms at day 14 and day 28 compared to participants receiving usual care. Conclusion Early administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery following early COVID-19 infection.",Sanjay Ramakrishnan; Dan V Nicolau Jr.; Beverly Langford; Mahdi Mahdi; Helen Jeffers; Christine Mwasuku; Karolina Krassowska; Robin Fox; Ian Binnian; Victoria Glover; Stephen Bright; Christopher Butler; Jennifer L Cane; Andreas Halner; Philippa C Matthews; Louise E Donnelly; Jodie L Simpson; Jonathan R Baker; Nabil T Fadai; Stefan Peterson; Thomas Bengtsson; Peter J Barnes; Richard E K Russell; Mona Bafadhel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251134,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251134,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
7,DrugWAS: Leveraging drug-wide association studies to facilitate drug repurposing for COVID-19,"Importance: There is an unprecedented need to rapidly identify safe and effective treatments for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as potential treatment for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Based on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data, drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on COVID-19 disease outcomes. Exposures: Patient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in structured format. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause of death was selected as primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes. Results: The study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized, 82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%) died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids), methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and fluticasone. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study leveraged EHR data to identify a list of drugs that could be repurposed to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of the proposed drugs.",Cosmin A Bejan; Katherine N Cahill; Patrick J Staso; Leen Choi; Josh F Peterson; Elizabeth Jane Phillips,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251169,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251169,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
8,Using Machine Learning to Predict Mortality for COVID-19 Patients on Day Zero in the ICU,"Rationale Given the expanding number of COVID-19 cases and the potential for upcoming waves of infection, there is an urgent need for early prediction of the severity of the disease in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to optimize treatment strategies. Objectives Early prediction of mortality using machine learning based on typical laboratory results and clinical data registered on the day of ICU admission. Methods We studied retrospectively 263 COVID-19 ICU patients. To find parameters with the highest predictive values, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Pearson chi-squared tests were used. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) algorithms were utilized to build classification models. The impact of each marker on the RF model predictions was studied by implementing the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation technique (LIME-SP). Results Among 66 documented parameters, 15 factors with the highest predictive values were identified as follows: gender, age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean cell hemoglobin along with a history of neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders. Our RF model can predict patients outcomes with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 75%. Conclusions The most decisive variables in our model were increased levels of BUN, lowered albumin levels, increased creatinine, INR, and RDW along with gender and age. Complete blood count parameters were also crucial for some patients. Considering the importance of early triage decisions, this model can be a useful tool in COVID-19 ICU decision-making.",Elham Jamshidi; Amirhossein Asgary; Nader Tavakoli; Alireza Zali; Hadi Esmaily; Seyed Hamid Jamaldini; Amir Daaee; Amirhesam Babajani; Mohammad Ali Sendani Kashi; Masoud Jamshidi; Sahand Rahi; Nahal Mansouri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
9,Symptoms of COVID-19 infection and magnitude of antibody response in a large community-based study,"Background The majority of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic with management in the home. Little is known about the frequency of specific symptoms in the general population, and how symptoms predict the magnitude of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We quantified IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in home-collected dried blood spot samples from 3,365 adults participating in a community-based seroprevalence study in the city of Chicago, USA, collected between June 24 and November 11, 2020. Results 17.8% of the sample was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. A cluster of symptoms (loss of sense of smell or taste, fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headache) was associated with stronger anti-RBD IgG responses among the seropositives. 39.2% of infections were asymptomatic, and 2 or fewer symptoms were reported for 66.7% of infections. Total number of symptoms was positively but weakly associated with IgG response: Median anti-RBD IgG was 0.95 ug/mL for individuals with 3 or more symptoms, in comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for asymptomatic infections. Conclusion We document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection in a large community-based cohort, and relatively low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the general population of previously exposed individuals.",Thomas W McDade; Joshua Schrock; Richard D'Aquila; Brian Mustanski; Nanette Benbow; Lauren Vaught; Nina Reiser; Matt Velez; Ryan Hsieh; Daniel Ryan; Rana Saber; ELIZABETH MCNALLY; Alexis R.

10,Longitudinal serology in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India - a prospective cohort study,"Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are now widely available, but there are little data on longitudinal serology in large cohorts, particularly from low-and middle-income countries. We established an ongoing prospective cohort of 3840 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals in the Delhi-National Capital Region of India, to document clinical and immunological characteristics during illness and convalescence. The IgG responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0-7, 10-28 days, and 6-10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates in the post-infection windows of 0-7 days, 10-28 days, and 6-10 weeks were 46%, 84.7%, and 85.3% respectively (n=782). The proportion with a serological response increased with the severity of COVID-19 disease. All participants with severe disease, 89.6% with mild to moderate infection, and 77.3% of asymptomatic participants had IgG antibodies to the RBD antigen. The threshold values in the nasopharyngeal viral RNA RT-PCR in a subset of asymptomatic and symptomatic seroconverters were comparable (p-value: 0.48), with similar results among non-seroconverters (p-value: 0.16) (n=169). This is the first report of longitudinal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a period of ten weeks from South Asia. The low seropositivity in asymptomatic participants and differences between assays highlight the importance of contextualizing the understanding of population serosurveys.",Ramachandran Thiruvengadam; Souvick Chattopadhyay; Farha Mehdi; Bapu Koundinya Desiraju; Susmita Chaudhuri; Savita Singh; Vandita Bhartia; Pallavi Kshetrapal; Uma Chandra Mouli Natchu; Nitya Wadhwa; Shailaja Sopory; Mudita Gosain; Anil K Pandey; Asim Das; Nidhi Anand; Nandini Sharma; Pragya Sharma; Sonal Saxena; Deepa Sindhu; Brahmdeep Sindhu; Dharmendra Sharma; Navin Dang; Gaurav Batra; Gagandeep Kang; Shinjini Bhatnagar; - DBT India Consortium for COVID-19 Research,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251140,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251140,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
11,Introduction of a hand dermatitis clinic to reduce occupational dermatoses during the covid-19 pandemic.,"Background: The SARS-Co-V pandemic has necessitated strict hand hygiene practices in healthcare settings. An increased incidence of staff presentations of occupational dermatitis in our institutions prompted the establishment of a drop-in access daily hand dermatitis clinic. Objective: to document the incidence and severity of cases of occupational dermatitis arising in healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic, and to reduce the impact of this with early assessment and treatment. Methods: an open-access daily staff clinic run by dermatologists was established, and demographic and clinical data collected from each clinical encounter. Results: 532 staff attended the clinic over a 6 week period. This compared to 7 staff presenting to occupational health over the same period in 2019. The majority were females 81%,and ward based 51%. ITU and A&E staff represented 15%. The prevalence of occupational hand dermatitis was 88%. 52% were classed as mild, 26% as moderate 26% and 9% severe/very severe. Conclusions: the pandemic and associated hand hygiene practices have led to a substantial increase in presentations of occupational hand dermatitis. A drop-in clinic proved an effective way of allowing staff to access treatment in a timely fashion.",Sarah Walsh; Siobhan Carey,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250767,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250767,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
12,Assessment of Vaccination and Underreporting on COVID-19 Infections in Turkey Based On Effective Reproduction Number,"In this paper, we introduce a SEIR type COVID-19 model where the infected class is further divided into individuals in intensive care (ICUs) and ventilation units. The model is validated with the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and the number of patients in ICUs and ventilation units as reported by Turkey Department of Health for the period March 11 through May 30 when the nationwide lockdown is in order. COVID-19 interventions in Turkey are incorporated into the model to detect the future trend of the outbreak accurately. The lockdown is lifted on June 1, and the model is modified to include a time dependent transmission rate which is linked to the effective reproduction number Rt through basic reproduction number R0. The modified model captures the changing dynamics and peaks of the outbreak successfully. With the onset of vaccination on 13 January 2021, we augment the model with the vaccination class to investigate the impact of vaccination rate and efficacy. We observe that vaccination rate is a more critical parameter than the vaccine efficacy to eliminate the disease successfully.",Emek Kose; Tugba Akman Yildiz; Necibe Tuncer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251176,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251176,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
13,COVID-19 prevention behaviour over time in Australia: Patterns and long-term predictors from April to July 2020,"Background: In Australia in March 2020 a national public health directive required that non-essential workers stay at home, except for essential activities. These restrictions began easing in May 2020 as community transmission slowed. Purpose: This study investigated changes in COVID-19 prevention behaviours from April-July 2020, and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours. Methods: 1,843 participants in Australia completed a national COVID-19 survey in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Principal components analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours. Multivariable regression models explored baseline (April) correlates of behaviour in June (a period of low community transmission) and July (a period of increasing community transmission). Results: On average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). PCA identified two behaviour types:'distancing' (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and 'hygiene' (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing declined each month (p's<.001), whereas hygiene remained relatively stable. For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated with adherence in June and July (p's<0.05). For hygiene, the only significant correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that one's actions could prevent infection of family members (p<.001). Conclusions: High adherence to COVID-19 prevention behaviours were reported; however, distancing behaviours tended to decrease over time. Belief in social responsibility may be an important aspect to consider in encouraging distancing behaviours. Different policy approaches may be needed for different behavioural categories.",Julie Ayre; Erin Cvejic; Kirsten J McCaffery; Tessa Copp; Samuel Cornell; Rachael H Dodd; Kristen Pickles; Carys Batcup; Jennifer MJ Isautier; Brooke Nickel; Thomas Dakin; Carissa Bonner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251165,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
14,Impact of school closures on the health and well-being of primary school children in Wales UK; a routine data linkage study using the HAPPEN survey (2018-2020).,"Introduction In response to the COVID19 pandemic, school closures were implemented across the United Kingdom. This study aimed to explore the impact of school closures on childrens health by comparing health and wellbeing outcomes collected during school closures (April to June 2020) with data from the same period in 2019 and 2018. Methods Data were collected online via the HAPPEN At Home survey, which captured the typical health behaviours of children aged 8 to 11 years between April and June 2020. These data were compared with data in 2018 and 2019 also collected between April and June, from HAPPEN. Free school meal (FSM) status was used as a proxy for socio-economic deprivation. Analyses were repeated stratifying by FSM. Results Comparing responses between April and June in 2020 (n=1068), 2019 (n=1150) and 2018 (n=475), there were improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM ate less fruit and vegetables (21% (95%CI (5.7% to 37%)) and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity (13.03% (95%CI: 3.3% to 21.7%) and consumed more takeaways (16.3% (95%CI: 2%-30%)) during school closures. Conclusion This study suggests that schools play an important role in reducing inequalities in physical health. The physical health (e.g. physical activity and diet) of children eligible for FSM may be impacted by prolonged school closures.",Michaela James; Emily Marchant; Margaret A Defeyter; Jayne V Woodside; Sinead Brophy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
15,Enhancing Food Security for Families Vulnerable to COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some of the underlying inequities in our society. Vulnerable and low-income communities who have typically struggled with food insecurity have been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To make matters worse, transit dependent households in the City of Detroit that rely on SNAP benefits from the government have a 54% probability of not having internet access, reducing the possibility of online food delivery. Thus, the motivation for the Detroit Food Delivery Pilot Program, a prepared meal delivery service for food insecure households during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, the City had aided 350 households; over 1,000 unique individuals and has served over 90,000 meals. This had all been made possible through the engagement of 575 volunteers, volunteering over 6,850 delivery miles. Our team helped to identify the magnitude and the needs of food insecure households, then partnered with the City of Detroit to modify existing food programs to address the crisis, and finally, assessed the impact of the program on the target population. Our analysis revealed that approximately 20,800 households will be classified as food insecure in Detroit and only a fraction of this population is benefitting from the food delivery pilot program. However, on average, the concerns about food sufficiency have abated appreciably from the surveys analyzed. Responses from the beneficiaries of the food delivery pilot program were positive though concerns about the travel behavior of individuals, particularly those from COVID-19 positive households remain.",Tayo Fabusuyi; Aditi Misra; Jon Martinez; Andong Chen; Vivian Jiang; H.

16,Staff-Pupil SARS-CoV-2 Infection Pathways in Schools: A Population Level Linked Data Approach,"Abstract Background: Better understanding of the role that children and school staff play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to guide policy development on controlling infection whilst minimising disruption to children's education and wellbeing. Methods: Our national e-cohort (n=500,779) study used anonymised linked data for pupils, staff and associated households linked via educational settings. We estimated the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff and pupils over the period August-December 2020, dependent on measures of recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational settings. Results: The total number of cases in a school was not associated with a subsequent increase in the risk of testing positive (Staff OR per case 0.92, 95%CI 0.85, 1.00; Pupils OR per case 0.98, 95%CI 0.93, 1.02). Amongst pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased risk of testing positive (OR per case 1.12, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.15). These effects were adjusted for a range of demographic covariates, and in particular any known cases within the same household, which had the strongest association with testing positive (Staff OR 39.86, 95%CI 35.01, 45.38, pupil OR 9.39, 95%CI 8.94 - 9.88). Conclusions: In a national school cohort, the odds of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not significantly increased in the 14-day period after case detection in the school. However, pupils were found to be at increased risk, following cases appearing within their own year group, where most of their contacts occur. Strong mitigation measures over the whole of the study period may have reduced wider spread within the school environment.",Daniel A Thompson; Hoda Abbasizanjani; Richard Fry; Emily Marchant; Lucy J Griffiths; Ashley Akbari; Joseph Hollinghurst; Laura North; Jane Lyons; Fatemeh Torabi; Gareth Davies; Mike B Gravenor; Ronan A Lyons,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251087,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251087,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
17,A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic,"The effective reproduction number Reff is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted with Bayesian inference (PMCMC) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data, without any specific hypothesis on its evolution. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its Reff(t). In this way, we can appropriately assess the effect of the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland.",Bernard Cazelles; Clara Champagne; Benjamin Nguyen Van Yen; Catherine Comiskey; Elisabeta Vergu; Benjamin Roche,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
18,Mapping internet activity in Australian cities during COVID-19 lockdown: how occupational factors drive inequality,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence has accumulated that movement restrictions enacted to combat virus spread produce disparate consequences along socioeconomic lines. One explanation for this differential impact is the distribution of people into occupations that can be performed from home and may provide greater financial security. However, little is known about the nature and scale of shifting home-based work patterns and their geographic distribution, despite this being a likely determinant of the success of geographically defined COVID-19 lockdown strategies. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure employment are better able to adapt to mobility restrictions, due to common occupational factors. In the context of two Australian urban centres, we test this hypothesis by analysing changes to home-based internet usage and quantify the relationship between area-level measures of population income security, the ability to perform job requirements remotely, and the degree of transition to home-based work during COVID-19. Our analysis confirms that financial security in Australia is geographically clustered and concentrated. Income security is also correlated with increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown, and home-based work patterns that persist post-lockdown. Our findings suggest that geographic diversity in preparedness for government-imposed restrictions should be factored into response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas.",Cameron Zachreson; Erika Martino; Martin Tomko; Freya M Shearer; Rebecca Bentley; Nicholas Geard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
19,Development and validation of an algorithm to estimate the risk of severe complications of COVID-19 to prioritise vaccination,"Objective: To develop an algorithm (sCOVID) to predict the risk of severe complications of COVID-19 in a community-dwelling population to optimise vaccination scenarios. Design: Population based cohort study Setting: 264 Dutch general practices contributing to the NL-COVID database Participants: 6074 people aged 0-99 diagnosed with COVID-19 Main outcome measures: Severe complications (hospitalisation, institutionalisation, death). The algorithm was developed from a training dataset comprising 70% of the patients and validated in the remaining 30%. Potential predictor variables included age, sex, a chronic co-morbidity score (CCS) based on risk factors for COVID-19 complications as defined by the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), obesity, neighborhood deprivation score (NDS), first or second COVID wave, and confirmation test. Six different population vaccination scenarios were explored: 1) random (naive), 2) random for persons above 60 years (60plus), 3) oldest patients first in age bands of five years (oldest first), 4) target population of the annual influenza vaccination program (influenza) and 5) those 25-65 years of age first (worker), and 6) risk-based using the prediction algorithm (sCOVID). For each vaccination strategy the amount of vaccinations needed to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was calculated. Results: Severe complications were reported in 243 (4.8%) people with 59 (20.3%) nursing home admissions, 181 (62.2%) hospitalisations and 51 (17.5%) deaths. The algorithm included age, sex, CCS, NDS, wave, and confirmation test with a c statistic of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94) in the validation set. Applied to different vaccination scenarios, the proportion of people needed to be vaccinated to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was 67.5%, 50.0%, 26.1%, 16.0%, 10.0%, and 8.4% for the worker, naive, infuenza, 60plus, oldest first, and sCOVID scenarios respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 related severe complications will be reduced most efficiently when vaccinations are risk-based, prioritizing the highest risk group using the sCOVID algorithm. The vaccination scenario, prioritising oldest people in age bands of 5 years down to 60 years of age, performed second best. The sCOVID algorithm can readily be applied to identify persons with highest risks from data in the electronic health records of GPs.",Ron MC Herings; Karin M.A. Swart; Bernard van der Zeijst; Amber A. van der Heijden; Koos van der Velden; Eric G.

20,Recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus AdC7 expressing dimeric tandem-repeat RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein protects mice against COVID-19,"A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have advanced into phase 3 trials, with three approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD) or dimeric tandem-repeat RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular (Th1-based) immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared with both AdC7-S and AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury. These results support AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429860,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429860,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,False
21,Impact of cobas PCR Media Freezing on SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Integrity and Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses,"SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is an important molecular biology tool performed to support many aspects of the response to the pandemic. Freezing of primary clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples and shipment to reference laboratories is usually required since RNA sequencing is rarely available in routine clinical microbiology laboratories where initial diagnosis and support to outbreak investigations occur. The cobas PCR Media transport medium developed by Roche facilitates high throughput analyses on cobas multianalyzer PCR platforms. There is no data on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after freezing and thawing of clinical samples in this transport medium, but potential denaturing of the molecular template could impair test results. Our objective was to compare the quality and results of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing when performed on fresh or frozen samples in cobas PCR Media. Viral whole genome sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. Genomic coverage and sequencing depth did not significantly differ between fresh and frozen samples (n=10). For samples with lower viral inoculum and PCR cycle threshold above 30, sequencing quality scores and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ either. Freezing of cobas PCR Media does not negatively affect the quality of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing results and it is therefore a suitable transport medium for outsourcing sequencing analyses to reference laboratories. Those results support secondary use of diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab material for viral sequencing without requirement for additional clinical samples.",Patrick Benoit; Cecile Tremblay; P.

22,Longitudinal Metabolomics of Human Plasma Reveals Robust Prognostic Markers of COVID-19 Disease Severity,"There is an urgent need to identify which COVID-19 patients will develop life-threatening illness so that scarce medical resources can be optimally allocated and rapid treatment can be administered early in the disease course, when clinical management is most effective. To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we performed untargeted metabolomics profiling of 341 patients with plasma samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we then built a predictive model of disease severity. We determined that the levels of 25 metabolites measured at the time of hospital admission successfully predict future disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirmed that these prognostic markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validated that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19. Our results indicate that metabolic changes associated with COVID-19 severity can be effectively used to stratify patients and inform resource allocation during the pandemic.",Miriam Sindelar; Ethan Stancliffe; Michaela Schwaiger-Haber; Dhanalakshmi S Anbukumar; Randy A Albrecht; wen-chun Liu; Kayla Adkins-Travis; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Leah P Shriver; Gary J Patti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251173,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251173,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

However, little is known about the persistence of the antibody response. We evaluated that the kinetics of anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody of SARS-CoV2 infected healthcare workers in COVID-19 cluster occurred hospital. The long-term kinetics of anti-N antibody was classified high and keep pattern, high and decay pattern, and low and keep pattern. COVID-19 contact and symptomaticity was not related to kinetic patterns. The reason of kinetic difference was still unclear.

25,Modelling the impact of contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic,"OBJECTIVES: With declining numbers of COVID-19 cases in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, social distancing measures were gradually being lifted. The risk of an increase in the number of cases, however, cannot be overlooked. Even with the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as restrictions on mass gatherings, wearing masks, and complete or partial closure of schools, other public health measures may help to control the epidemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic regardless of the use of diagnostic testing. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model that includes isolation of symptomatic individuals and tracing of contacts to assess the effects of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of Sao Paulo. RESULTS: For a selection efficacy (proportion of isolated contacts who are infected) of 80%, cases and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other hand, for a selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no contact tracing strategy is performed. CONCLUSION: Contact tracing of symptomatic individuals may be a potential alternative strategy when the number of diagnostic tests available is not sufficient for a massive testing strategy.",Marcos Amaku; Dimas Tadeu Covas; Francisco Antonio Bezerra Coutinho; Raymundo Soares Azevedo; Eduardo Massad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251222,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251222,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
26,Outdoor transmission of COVID-19: Analysis of windspeed,"Background To examine whether outdoor exposures may contribute to the COVID-19 epidemic, we hypothesized that slower outdoor windspeed is associated with increased risk of transmission when individuals socialize outside. Methods Daily COVID-19 incidence reported between 3/16/2020-12/31/2020 was the outcome. Average windspeed and maximal daily temperature were derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Negative binomial regression was used to model incidence, adjusting for susceptible population size. Results Cases were very high in the initial wave but diminished quickly once lockdown procedures were enacted. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed that warmer days with windspeed <5.5 MPH had increased COVID-19 incidence (aIRR=1.50, 95% C.I.=[1.25-1.81], P<0.001) as compared to days with average windspeed [&ge;]5.5 MPH.

27,UK and other SARS-CoV-2-Covariants - Simulation Modeling 70% Increase,"CovidSIMVL, an agent-based contagion-based viral transmission simulation tool, was employed to simulate the effects of viral agents of differing levels of infectivity. The constructs ""Velocity"" and ""Increase in Velocity"" were operationalized in terms of rates of transmission events over successive iterations (generations) in a set of CovidSIMVL trials. Treating 40-70% increase in velocity as a target, based on reports in the literature for the UK variant (VUI 202012/01), the series of trials reported in the paper demonstrate the calibration of CovidSIMVL parameters to produce increases in transmission rates of 40-70% above a baseline value. A series of follow-up studies is proposed to evaluate three different possible explanations for reported increases in SARS-Cov2-2 infections that are being attributed to spread of the UK and other variants: (a) simulations where the inherent characteristics of the virus (infectivity) are varied (genomic studies); (b) simulations where the behaviour of agents is varied (e.g., movement within and between spaces) while inherent characteristics of the virus are held constant (behavioural studies); and (c) simulations where both inherent properties of the virus and the behaviour of agents are varying to ""tease out"" the interaction between biologically-based contributions to increased case counts, and contextual/behavioural contributions (epigenetic studies).",Ernie Chang; Kenneth Andrew Moselle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251230,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251230,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
28,How effective was Newfoundland & Labrador's travel ban to prevent the spread of COVID-19? An agent-based analysis,"Background: To prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Newfoundland & Labrador (NL), NL implemented a wide travel ban in May 2020. We estimate the effectiveness this travel ban using a customized agent-based simulation (ABS). Methods: We built an individual-level ABS to simulate the movements and behaviors of every member of the NL population, including arriving and departing travellers. The model considers individual properties (spatial location, age, comorbidities) and movements between environments, as well as age-based disease transmission with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic transmission rates. We examine low, medium, and high travel volume, traveller infection rates, and traveller quarantine compliance rates to determine the effect of travellers on COVID spread, and the ability of contact tracing to contain outbreaks. Results: Infected travellers increased COVID cases by 4-74x times and peak hospitalizations by 4-96x, without contact tracing. Although contact tracing was highly effective at reducing spread, it was insufficient to stop outbreaks caused by travellers in even the best-case scenario, and the likelihood of exceeding contact tracing capacity was a concern in most scenarios. Quarantine compliance had only a small impact on COVID spread; travel volume and infection rate drove spread. Interpretation: NL's travel ban was likely a critically important intervention to prevent COVID spread. Even a small number of infected travellers can play a significant role in introducing new chains of transmission, resulting in exponential community spread and significant increases in hospitalizations, while outpacing contact tracing capabilities. With the presence of more transmissible variants, e.g., the UK variant, prevention of imported cases is even more critical.",Dionne M Aleman; Benjamin Z Tham; Sean J Wagner; Justin Semelhago; Asghar Mohammadi; Paul Price; Randy Giffen; Proton Rahman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251157,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251157,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

Accurate prevalence estimates, however, can be difficult to calculate due to a combination of low population prevalence, imperfect diagnostic tests, and limited testing resources. In addition, strategies based on convenience samples that target only symptomatic or high-risk individuals will yield biased estimates of the population prevalence. We present Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification models that incorporate probability sampling designs, the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test, and specimen pooling to obtain unbiased prevalence estimates. These models easily incorporate all available prior information and can yield reasonable inferences even with very low base rates and limited testing resources. We examine the performance of these models with an extensive numerical study that varies the sampling design, sample size, true prevalence, and pool size. We also demonstrate the relative robustness of the models to key prior distribution assumptions via sensitivity analyses.",Eric J Oh; Alyssa Mikytuck; Vicki Lancaster; Joshua Goldstein; Sallie Keller,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251231,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251231,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

The exact role that correctional facilities play in enhancing COVID-19 spread and enabling community re-emergence of COVID-19 is unknown. We constructed a novel stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission to estimate the impact of correctional facilities, specifically jails and state prisons, for enhancing disease transmission and enabling disease re-emergence in local communities. Using our model, we evaluated scenarios of testing and quarantining infected incarcerated people at 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 times the rate that occurs for infected people in the local community for population sizes of 5, 10, and 20 thousand people. Our results illustrate testing and quarantining an incarcerated population of 800 would reduce the probability of a major community outbreak by 6% and also prevent between 250 to 730 incidences of COVID-19 per year, depending on local community size. These findings illustrate that managing COVID-19 in correctional facilities is essential to mitigate risks to community health, and thereby stresses the importance of improving the health standards of incarcerated people.",Scott Greenhalgh; Ashley Provencher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251174,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251174,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
31,Modeling the Effect of Population-Wide Vaccination on the Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in Canada,"Population-wide vaccination is critical for containing the COVID-19 pandemic when combined with effective testing and prevention measures. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, several companies worked tirelessly for the development of an efficient vaccine that would put an end to this pandemic. Today, a number of COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use by a number of national regulatory organizations. Vaccination campaigns have already started in several countries with different daily-vaccination rates depending on the country's vaccination capacity. Therefore, we find it timely and extremely important to conduct a study on the effect of population-wide vaccination campaigns on the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. To this end, we propose a new deterministic mathematical model to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic evolution under the effect of vaccination and vaccine efficacy. This model, referred to as SIRV, consists of a compartmental SIR (susceptible, infectious and removed) model augmented with an additional state V representing the effectively vaccinated population as well as two inputs representing the daily-vaccination rate and the vaccine efficacy. Using our SIRV model, we predict the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada and its most affected provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), for different daily vaccination rates and vaccine efficacy. Projections suggest that, without vaccination, 219,000 lives could be lost across Canada by the end of 2021 due to COVID-19. The ongoing vaccination campaign across Canada seems to unfold relatively slowly at an average daily rate close to 1/2 vaccine per 1,000 population. At this pace, we could be saving more than 77,496 lives by the end of the year. Doubling the current vaccination efforts (1 vaccine per day per 1,000 population) could be sufficient to save 125,839 lives in Canada during the current year 2021. We would like to point out that our study assumes that the vaccine is perfectly safe without any short or long term side-effects. This study has been conducted independently at arm's length from vaccine manufacturers, using the available data from Canada health services.

Closely monitoring public engagement and perception of COVID-19 and preventive measures using social media data could provide important information for understanding the progress of current interventions and planning future programs. Objective: To measure the public behaviors and perceptions regarding COVID-19 and its daily life effects during the recent 5 months of the pandemic. Methods: Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms were used to identify COVID-19 related and unrelated topics in over 300 million online data sources from June 15 to November 15, 2020. Posts in the sample were geotagged, and sensitivity and specificity were both calculated to validate the classification of posts. The prevalence of discussion regarding these topics was measured over this time period and compared to daily case rates in the US. Results: The final sample size included 9,065,733 posts, 70% of which were sourced from the US. In October and November, discussion including mentions of COVID-19 and related health behaviors did not increase as it had from June to September, despite an increase in COVID-19 daily cases in the US beginning in October. Additionally, counter to reports from March and April, discussion was more focused on daily life topics (69%), compared with COVID-19 in general (37%) and COVID-19 public health measures (20%). Conclusions: There was a decline in COVID-19-related social media discussion sourced mainly from the US, even as COVID-19 cases in the US have increased to the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic. Targeted public health messaging may be needed to ensure engagement in public health prevention measures until a vaccine is widely available to the public.",Daisy Massey; Yuan Lu; Chenxi Huang; Alina Cohen; Yahel Oren; Tali Moed; Pini Matzner; Shiwani Mahajan; Cesar Caraballo; Navin Kumar; Yuchen Xue; Qinglan Ding; Rachel P Dreyer; Brita Roy; Harlan Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250127,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250127,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
33,Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States,"As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.",Nicole L.

34,"Neutralization of viruses with European, South African, and United States SARS-CoV-2 variant spike proteins by convalescent sera and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies","The increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein has raised concerns that recovered individuals may not be protected from reinfection and that current vaccines will become less effective. The B.1.1.7 isolate identified in the United Kingdom and B.1.351 isolate identified in the Republic of South Africa encode spike proteins with multiple mutations in the S1 and S2 subunits. In addition, variants have been identified in Columbus, Ohio (COH.20G/677H), Europe (20A.EU2) and in domesticated minks. Analysis by antibody neutralization of pseudotyped viruses showed that convalescent sera from patients infected prior to the emergence of the variant viruses neutralized viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, COH.20G/677H Columbus Ohio, 20A.EU2 Europe and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor decrease in titer compared to that of the earlier D614G spike protein. Serum specimens from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine neutralized D614G virus with titers that were on average 7-fold greater than convalescent sera. Vaccine elicited antibodies neutralized virus with the B.1.1.7 spike protein with titers similar to D614G virus and neutralized virus with the B.1.351 spike with, on average, a 3-fold reduction in titer (1:500), a titer that was still higher than the average titer with which convalescent sera neutralized D614G (1:139). The reduction in titer was attributable to the E484K mutation in the RBD. The B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses were not more infectious than D614G on ACE2.293T cells in vitro but N501Y, an ACE2 contacting residue present in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and COH.20G/677H spike proteins caused higher affinity binding to ACE2, likely contributing to their increased transmissibility. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by primary infection and by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are likely to maintain protective efficacy against B.1.1.7 and most other variants but that the partial resistance of virus with the B.1.351 spike protein could render some individuals less well protected, supporting a rationale for the development of modified vaccines containing E484K.",Takuya Tada; Belinda M Dcosta; Marie Samanovic-Golden; Ramin S Herati; Amber Cornelius; Mark J Mulligan; Nathaniel R Landau,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.430003,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.430003,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False

After the virus sequence was published, we identified two potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD from antibody libraries using a phage-to-yeast (PtY) display platform in only 10 days. Our lead antibody JMB2002, now in a phase I clinical trial, showed broad-spectrum in vitro blocking activity against hACE2 binding to the RBD of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including B.1.351 that was reportedly much more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma, vaccine sera and some clinical stage neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, JMB2002 has demonstrated complete prophylactic and potent therapeutic efficacy in a rhesus macaque disease model.

36,Human immunoglobulin from transchromosomic bovines hyperimmunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen efficiently neutralizes viral variants.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with amino-acid substitutions and deletions in spike protein (S) can reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may compromise immunity induced by vaccines. We report a polyclonal, fully human, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin produced in transchromosomic bovines (Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2) hyperimmunized with two doses of plasmid DNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain S gene, followed by repeated immunization with S protein purified from insect cells. The resulting Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2, termed SAB-185, efficiently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) SARS-CoV-2 chimeras in vitro. Neutralization potency was retained for S variants including S477N, E484K, and N501Y, substitutions present in recent variants of concern. In contrast to the ease of selection of escape variants with mAbs and convalescent human plasma, we were unable to isolate VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutants resistant to Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

37,Targeting CTP Synthetase 1 to Restore Interferon Induction and Impede Nucleotide Synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with astonishing mortality and morbidity. The mechanisms underpinning its highly infectious nature remain poorly understood. We report here that SARS-CoV-2 exploits cellular CTP synthetase 1 (CTPS1) to promote CTP synthesis and suppress interferon (IFN) induction. Screening a SARS-CoV-2 expression library identified ORF7b and ORF8 that suppressed IFN induction via inducing the deamidation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Deamidated IRF3 fails to bind the promoters of classic IRF3-responsible genes, thus muting IFN induction. Conversely, a shRNA-mediated screen focused on cellular glutamine amidotransferases corroborated that CTPS1 deamidates IRF3 to inhibit IFN induction. Functionally, ORF7b and ORF8 activate CTPS1 to promote de novo CTP synthesis while shutting down IFN induction. De novo synthesis of small-molecule inhibitors of CTPS1 enabled CTP depletion and IFN induction in SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus impeding SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our work uncovers a strategy that a viral pathogen couples immune evasion to metabolic activation to fuel viral replication. Inhibition of the cellular CTPS1 offers an attractive means for developing antiviral therapy that would be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 mutation.",Youliang Rao; Ting-Yu Wang; Chao Qin; Bianca Espinosa; Qizhi Liu; Arunika Ekanayake; Jun Zhao; Ali Can Savas; Shu Zhang; Mehrnaz Zarinfar; Yongzhen Liu; Wenjie Zhu; Nicholas Alexander Graham; Taijiao Jiang; Chao Zhang; Pinghui Feng,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429959,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429959,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
38,The local topological free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells using a mechanism that involves binding and structural rearrangement of its spike protein. Understanding protein rearrangement and identifying specific residues where mutations affect protein rearrangement has attracted a lot of attention for drug development. We use a mathematical method introduced in (Baldwin2021) to associate a local topological/geometrical free energy along the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein backbone. Our results show that the total local topological free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monotonically decreases from pre-to post-fusion and that its distribution along the protein domains is related to their activity in protein rearrangement. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with inclusion of solvent effects, we show that high local topological free energy conformations are unstable compared to those of low topological free energy. By comparing to experimental data, we find that the high local topological free energy conformations in the spike protein are associated with mutations which have the largest experimentally observed effect to protein rearrangement.",Quenisha Baldwin; Bobby G Sumpter; Eleni Panagiotou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430094,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430094,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
39,Insights on SARS-CoV-2's Mutations for Evading Human Antibodies: Sacrifice and Survival,"Recent mutations on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein have been manifested as the major cause of the wide and rapid spread of the virus. Especially, the variant B.1.351 in South Africa with the hallmark of triple mutations (N501Y, K417N and E484K) is worrisome. Quickly after the outbreak of this new variant, several studies showed that both N501Y and E484K can enhance the binding between RBD and the human ACE2 receptor. However, the mutation K417N seems to be unfavorable because it removes one interfacial salt-bridge. So far, it is still not well understood why the K417N mutation is selected in the viral evolution. Here, we show that despite the loss in the binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2 the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt-bridge between RBD and the neutralizing antibody CB6 and thus substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, facilitating the variants to efficiently elude CB6 (as well as many other antibodies). Thus, when proliferating from person to person the virus might have adapted to the human immune system through evasive mutations. Taking into account limited and relevant experimental works in the field, we show that our theoretical predictions are consistent with existing experimental findings. By harnessing the revealed molecular mechanism for variants, it becomes feasible to redesign therapeutic antibodies accordingly to make them more efficacious.",Binquan Luan; Tien Huynh,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430088,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430088,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
40,Self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccines targeting the S protein induces protective immunity in mice,"The spike (S), a homotrimer glycoprotein, is the most important antigen target in the research and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. There is no doubt that fully simulating the advanced structure of this homotrimer in the subunit vaccine development strategy is the most likely way to improve the immune protective effect of the vaccine. In this study, the preparation strategies of S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) trimer, S1 region trimer, and ectodomain (ECD) trimer nanoparticles were designed based on ferritin nanoparticle self-assembly technology. The Bombyx mori baculovirus expression system was used to prepare these three nanoparticle vaccines with high expression levels in the silkworm. The immune results of mice show that the nanoparticle vaccine prepared by this strategy can not only induce an immune response by subcutaneous administration but also effective by oral administration. Given the stability of these ferritin-based nanoparticles vaccine, easy-to-use and low-cost oral immunization strategy can make up for the vaccination blind areas caused by the shortage of ultralow-temperature equipment and medical resources in underdeveloped areas. And the oral vaccine is also a very potential candidate to cut off the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic and farmed animals, especially in stray and wild animals.",Xingjian Liu; Haozhi Song; Jianmin Jiang; Xintao Gao; Yongzhu Yi; Yuting Shang; Jialei Li; Dan Li; Zhen Zeng; Yinu Li; Zhifang Zhang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428685,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428685,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
41,"Assessing knowledge, concerns, and risk perceptions among Italian medical students during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE During the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic, Italian medical students transitioned from in-person to remote learning. This study was carried out to early assess students' sources of information, perceived risk of infection, knowledge and preventive practices in order to resume academic activity. The impact of training and volunteer work was also assessed. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2020 among medical students enrolled in the School of Medicine and Surgery, Bologna University. RESULTS The analysis included 537 responses. On average students used seven sources of information on COVID-19. Scientific journals were considered the most trustworthy but they ranked only 6th in the frequency of use. Perceived risk of infection was higher for academic activities, especially in the hospital than daily living activities. Less than 50% of students reported being trained on biological risk and use of PPE. Training received was significantly associated with both perceived risk of infection and confidence in the use of PPE. Students engaged in volunteer work had higher confidence in PPE usage. INTERPRETATION Accessible scientific information and students' engagement in spreading correct knowledge play an important role in challenging misinformation during the pandemic crisis. Students showed suboptimal knowledge about PPE use, calling for additional training. We found a moderate-high perceived risk of infection that could be mitigated with specific educational programs and by promoting voluntary work. Students' engagement in public health emergencies (PHE) could potentially be beneficial for their training and as well as for the healthcare system.",Manfredi Greco; Elisa Maietti; Elena Savoia; Davide Trere; Chiara Reno; Flavia Rallo; Maria Pia Fantini; DAVIDE GORI,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250922,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
42,"Was R<1 before the English lockdowns? On modelling mechanistic detail, causality and inference about Covid-19","Detail is a double edged sword in epidemiological modelling. The inclusion of mechanistic detail in models of highly complex systems has the potential to increase realism, but it also increases the number of modelling assumptions, which become harder to check as their possible interactions multiply. Knock et al (2020) fit an age structured SEIR model with added health service compartments to data on deaths, hospitalization and test results from Covid-19 in seven English regions for the period March to December 2020. The simplest version of the model has 684 states per region. One main conclusion is that only full lockdowns brought the pathogen reproduction number, R, below one, with R >> 1 in all regions on the eve of March 2020 lockdown. We critically evaluate the Knock et al. epidemiological model, and the semi-causal conclusions made using it, based on an independent reimplementation of the model designed to allow relaxation of some of its strong assumptions. In particular, Knock et al. model the effect on transmission of both non-pharmaceutical interventions and weather using a piecewise linear function, b(t), with 12 breakpoints at selected government announcement or intervention dates. We replace this representation by a smoothing spline with time varying smoothness, thereby allowing the form of b(t) to be substantially more data driven. We conclude that there is no sound basis for using the Knock et al. model and their analysis to make counterfactual statements about the number of deaths that would have occurred with different lockdown timings. However, if fits of this epidemiological model structure are viewed as a reasonable basis for inference about the time course of incidence and R, then without very strong modelling assumptions, the pathogen reproduction number was probably below one, and incidence in substantial decline, some days before either of the first two English national lockdowns. Of course this does not imply that lockdowns had no effect, but it does suggest that other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were much more effective than Knock et al. imply.",Simon N Wood; Ernst C Wit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251112,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251112,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
43,Symptom Prediction and Mortality Risk Calculation for COVID-19 Using Machine Learning,"Background Early prediction of symptoms and mortality risks for COVID-19 patients would improve healthcare outcomes, allow for the appropriate distribution of healthcare resources, reduce healthcare costs, aid in vaccine prioritization and self-isolation strategies, and thus reduce the prevalence of the disease. Such publicly accessible prediction models are lacking, however. Methods Based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing machine learning (ML) methods, we created two models based solely on the age, gender, and medical histories of 23,749 hospital-confirmed COVID-19 patients from February to September 2020: a symptom prediction model (SPM) and a mortality prediction model (MPM). The SPM predicts 12 symptom groups for each patient: respiratory distress, consciousness disorders, chest pain, paresis or paralysis, cough, fever or chill, gastrointestinal symptoms, sore throat, headache, vertigo, loss of smell or taste, and muscular pain or fatigue. The MPM predicts the death of COVID-19-positive individuals. Results The SPM yielded ROC-AUCs of 0.53-0.78 for symptoms. The most accurate prediction was for consciousness disorders at a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 70%. 2440 deaths were observed in the study population. MPM had a ROC-AUC of 0.79 and could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 70%. About 90% of deaths occurred in the top 21 percentile of risk groups. To allow patients and clinicians to use these models easily, we created a freely accessible online interface at www.aicovid.org. Conclusions The ML models predict COVID-19-related symptoms and mortality using information that is readily available to patients as well as clinicians. Thus, both can rapidly estimate the severity of the disease, allowing shared and better healthcare decisions with regard to hospitalization, self-isolation strategy, and COVID-19 vaccine prioritization in the coming months.",Elham Jamshidi; Amirhossein Asgary; Nader Tavakoli; Alireza Zali; Farzaneh Dastan; Amir Daaee; Mohammadtaghi Badakhshan; Hadi Esmaily; Seyed Hamid Jamaldini; Saeid Safari; Ehsan Bastanhagh; Ali Maher; Amirhesam Babajani; Maryam Mehrazi; Mohammad Ali Sendani Kashi; Masoud Jamshidi; Mohammad Hassan Sendani; Sahand Jamal Rahi; Nahal Mansouri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251143,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
44,Prioritizing allocation of COVID-19 vaccines based on social contacts increases vaccination effectiveness,"We study allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to individuals based on the structural properties of their underlying social contact network. Even optimistic estimates suggest that most countries will likely take 6 to 24 months to vaccinate their citizens. These time estimates and the emergence of new viral strains urge us to find quick and effective ways to allocate the vaccines and contain the pandemic. While current approaches use combinations of age-based and occupation-based prioritizations, our strategy marks a departure from such largely aggregate vaccine allocation strategies. We propose a novel approach motivated by recent advances in (i) science of real-world networks that point to efficacy of certain vaccination strategies and (ii) digital technologies that improve our ability to estimate some of these structural properties. Using a realistic representation of a social contact network for the Commonwealth of Virginia, combined with accurate surveillance data on spatiotemporal cases and currently accepted models of within- and between-host disease dynamics, we study how a limited number of vaccine doses can be strategically distributed to individuals to reduce the overall burden of the pandemic. We show that allocation of vaccines based on individuals' degree (number of social contacts) and total social proximity time is significantly more effective than the currently used age-based allocation strategy in terms of number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Our results suggest that in just two months, by March 31, 2021, compared to age-based allocation, the proposed degree-based strategy can result in reducing an additional 56-110k infections, 3.2- 5.4k hospitalizations, and 700-900 deaths just in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Extrapolating these results for the entire US, this strategy can lead to 3-6 million fewer infections, 181-306k fewer hospitalizations, and 51-62k fewer deaths compared to age-based allocation. The overall strategy is robust even: (i) if the social contacts are not estimated correctly; (ii) if the vaccine efficacy is lower than expected or only a single dose is given; (iii) if there is a delay in vaccine production and deployment; and (iv) whether or not non-pharmaceutical interventions continue as vaccines are deployed. For reasons of implementability, we have used degree, which is a simple structural measure and can be easily estimated using several methods, including the digital technology available today. These results are significant, especially for resource-poor countries, where vaccines are less available, have lower efficacy, and are more slowly distributed.",Jiangzhuo Chen; Stefan Hoops; Achla Marathe; Henning Mortveit; Bryan Lewis; Srinivasan Venkatramanan; Arash Haddadan; Parantapa Bhattacharya; Abhijin Adiga; Anil Vullikanti; Mandy Wilson; Gal Ehrlich; Maier Fenster; Stephen Eubank; Christopher Barrett; Madhav Marathe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251012,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251012,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True

We have followed time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in ten countries. We examined complete SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID with sampling extending until January 20, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, USA, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China. Among the novel mutations, some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased over time. VUI2012/01 (B.1.1.7) and 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), the UK and South Africa variants, respectively, and two variants from Brazil, 484K.V2, P.1 and P.2, increased in prevalence.

Methods: Electronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17th March 2020 - 1st May 2020) and (cohort 2: 18th May 2020 - 6th July 2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data.

Results: Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). Over the 2 cohorts, age >70 (p<0.001), male gender (p<0.05), hypertension (p<0.01), heart failure (p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.001), frailty (p<0.001), COPD (p<0.05), delirium (p<0.001), elevated peri-operative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p<0.001), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.01); and the 4C score were associated with 30-day mortality. When compared with the 4C score, greater frailty (OR 10.2, 95% C.I. 3.4 to 30.6, p<0.01) and low albumin (OR 5.6, 95% C.I. 2.0 to 15.6, p<0.01) were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality.

Conclusion: In addition to the 4C mortality score, frailty score and a low albumin were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality in two consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Article summary: In two consecutive cohorts of patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to two urban teaching hospitals in Glasgow, UK, there were variations in a number of clinicopathological characteristics despite similar mortality (23 and 22%). In these two cohorts, in a multivariate analysis that included the 4C mortality score, clinical frailty score >3, low serum albumin concentration (<35 g/L), high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (>5), and abnormal serum sodium concentration (<133/>145 mmol/L) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality.",Donogh Maguire; Donald McMillan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250932,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250932,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
47,Assessing the performance of a serological point-of-care test in measuring detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"Objective: To investigate the performance of a rapid point-of-care antibody test, the BioMedomics COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test, in comparison with a high-quality, validated, laboratory-based platform, the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Methods: Serological testing was conducted on 708 individuals. Concordance metrics were estimated. Logistic regression was used to assess associations with seropositivity. Results: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 63.4% (449/708; 95% CI 59.8%-66.9%) using the BioMedomics assay and 71.9% (509/708; 95% CI 68.5%-75.1%) using the Elecsys assay. There were 62 discordant results between the two assays. One specimen was seropositive in the BioMedomics assay, but seronegative in the Elecsys assay, while 61 specimens were seropositive in the Elecsys assay, but seronegative in the BioMedomics assay. Positive, negative, and overall percent agreements between the two assays were 88.0% (95% CI 84.9%-90.6%), 99.5% (95% CI 97.2%-99.9%), and 91.2% (95% CI 88.9%-93.1%), respectively, with a Cohen kappa of 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83), indicating excellent agreement. Excluding specimens with lower antibody titers, the agreement improved with positive, negative, and overall percent concordance of 91.2% (95% CI 88.2%-93.6%), 99.5% (95% CI 97.2%-99.9%), and 93.9% (95% CI 91.7%-95.5%), respectively, and a Cohen kappa of 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.89). Logistic regression confirmed better agreement with higher antibody titers. Conclusion: The BioMedomics COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test demonstrated excellent performance in measuring detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the utility of such rapid point-of-care serological testing to guide the public health responses and possible vaccine prioritization.",Peter V Coyle; Reham Awni El Kahlout; Soha R.

48,"Combination therapy of Tocilizumab and steroid for management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome: A single center experience from Pune, Western India","Background: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is thought to be the cause of inflammatory lung damage, worsening pneumonia and death in patients with COVID-19. Steroids (Methylprednisolone or Dexamethasone) and Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, are approved for the treatment of CRS in India. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ and steroids in COVID-19 associated CRS. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary level private hospital in Pune, India between 2nd April and 2nd November 2020. All patients administered TCZ and steroids for treatment of CRS were included. The primary endpoint was the incidence of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were the need for mechanical ventilation and incidence of infectious complications. Baseline and time-dependent risk factors significantly associated with death were identified by Relative risk estimation. Results: Out of 2831 admitted patients, 515 (24.3% females) were administered TCZ and steroids. Median age of the cohort was 57 (IQR: 46.5, 66) years. Almost 72 % patients had preexisting co-morbidities. Median time to TCZ administration since onset of symptoms was 9 days (IQR: 7, 11). 63% patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Mechanical ventilation was required in 242 (47%) patients. Of these, 44.2% (107/242) recovered and were weaned off the ventilator. There were 135 deaths (26.2%), while 380 patients (73.8%) had clinical improvement. Infectious complications like hospital acquired pneumonia, bloodstream bacterial and fungal infections were observed in 2.13 %, 2.13 % and 0.06 % patients respectively.

49,Subgenomic RNAs as molecular indicators of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,"In coronaviridae such as SARS-CoV-2, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) are replicative intermediates, therefore, their abundance and structures could infer viral replication activity and severity of host infection. Here, we systematically characterized the sgRNA expression and their structural variation in 81 clinical specimens collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with a goal of assessing viral genomic signatures of disease severity. We demonstrated the highly coordinated and consistent expression of sgRNAs from individuals with robust infections that results in symptoms, and found their expression is significantly repressed in the asymptomatic infections, indicating that the ratio of sgRNAs to genomic RNA (sgRNA/gRNA) is highly correlated with the severity of the disease. Using long read sequencing technologies to characterize full-length sgRNA structures, we also observed widespread deletions in viral RNAs, and identified unique sets of deletions preferentially found primarily in symptomatic individuals, with many likely to confer changes in SARS-CoV-2 virulence and host responses. Furthermore, based on the sgRNA structures, the frequently occurred structural variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes serves as a mechanism to further induce SARS-CoV-2 proteome complexity. Taken together, our results show that differential sgRNA expression and structural mutational burden both appear to be correlated with the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Longitudinally monitoring sgRNA expression and structural diversity could further guide treatment responses, testing strategies, and vaccine development.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430041,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430041,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,False
50,"Could the new COVID-19 mutant strain undermine vaccination efforts? A mathematical modelling approach for estimating the spread of the UK mutant strain using Ontario, Canada, as a case study","BackgroundInfections represent highly dynamic processes, characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents, viruses, such as the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to takeover a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study, but the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogens.

Methods and findingsWe devise a two-strain mathematical framework, to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain is unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. Current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will mostly likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to have an immune population by end of 2021.

ConclusionsOur findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy-and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease.",Matthew Betti; Nicola Bragazzi; Jane Marie Heffernan; Jude Dzevela Kong; Angie Raad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251039,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251039,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
51,Quantifying transmissibility of COVID-19 and impact of intervention within long-term health care facilities,"Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are particularly variable in the context of transmission within locations such as long-term health care (LTHC) facilities. We sought to characterise the heterogeneity of R0 across known outbreaks within these facilities. We used a unique comprehensive dataset of all outbreaks that have occurred within LTHC facilities in British Columbia, Canada. We estimated R0 with a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic model of susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals, that incorporates heterogeneity of R0 between facilities. We further compared these estimates to those obtained with standard methods that utilize the exponential growth rate and maximum likelihood. The total size of an outbreak varied dramatically, with a range of attack rates of 2%-86%. The Bayesian analysis provides more constrained overall estimates of R0 = 2.83 (90% CrI [credible interval] 0.25- 7.19) than standard methods, with a range within facilities of 0.66-10.06. We further estimated that intervention led to 67% (56%-73%) of all cases being averted within the LTHC facilities.

53,Estimating vaccine confidence levels among future healthcare workers and their trainers: A quantitative study protocol,"IntroductionThe outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caught the world off guard in the first quarter of the year 2020. To stem the tide of this pandemic, the development, testing, and pre-licensure approval for emergency use of some COVID 19 vaccine candidates were accelerated. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy which was already declared one of the top ten threats to global health in the year 2019. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a skeptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs becomes critical to the success of vaccination endeavors, especially COVID 19 vaccination. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID 19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention.

Methods and analysisAn online survey will be distributed to current staff and students of an academic institution for HCWs. The survey questionnaire will consist of a demographic questions section consisting of six items and a vaccine confidence section comprising six items in Likert scale format.

A multinomial logistic regression model will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. Statistical significance will be defined at a p-value <0.05.

Ethics and disseminationEthics approval has been obtained for the study from Stellenbosch University (HREC Reference # S19/01/014 (PhD)). The results will be shared with relevant health authorities, presented at conferences, and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

54,HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY INFECTION BY COVID-19: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL,"The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) represents a major public health problem due to its rapid spread and its ability to generate severe pneumonia. Thus, it is essential to find a treatment that reduces mortality. Our objective was to estimate whether treatment with 400 mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine for 10 days reduces in-hospital mortality in subjects with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 compared with placebo.

Material and methodsA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe disease by COVID-19 through an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible for the study were adults aged more than 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and lung injury requiring hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: days of mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events.

ResultsA total of 214 patients with COVID-19 were recruited, randomized and analyzed. They were hypoxemic with a mean SpO2 of 65% {+/-} 20, tachycardic (pulse rate 108{+/-}17 min-1) and tachypneic (32 {+/-}10 min-1); 162 were under mechanical ventilation at randomization. Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups (38% in Hydroxychloroquine vs. 41% in placebo, hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.51-1.53). In the surviving participants, no significant difference was found in secondary outcomes.

ConclusionNo beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of Hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

56,Impact of personal protective equipment use on health care workers physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in high-risk clinical settings have been obliged to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

AimTo assess the impact of PPE use on HCWs physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, we examined factors related with a greater risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use.

MethodsWe applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the Cochrane criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL and pre-print services (medRxiv) from January 1, 2020 to December 27, 2020.

FindingsOur review included 14 studies with 11,746 HCWs from 16 countries. The estimated overall prevalence of adverse events among HCWs was 78% (95% CI: 66.7-87.5%) with a range from 42.8% to 95.1% among studies. The prevalence of adverse events was higher for the studies with poor quality compared to those with moderate quality (83.5% vs. 67.1%), while increased sample size was related with decreased prevalence (p<0.001). The most frequent adverse events were headache (55.9%), dry skin (54.4%), dyspnoea (53.4%), pressure injuries (40.4%), itching (39.8%), hyperhidrosis (38.5%), and dermatitis (31.0%). Among others, the following factors were related with the risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use: female gender, younger age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, smoking pre-existing headache, longer duration of shifts wearing PPE, increased consecutive days with PPE, and increased exposure to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionThe frequency of adverse events amongst HCWs due to PPE use is very high. Further studies should be conducted since the limitations of this review do not allow us to infer conclusive results especially in case of risk factors for the occurrence of adverse events.

58,"Association between Median Household Income, State Medicaid Expansion Status, and COVID-19 Outcomes Across US Counties","ObjectiveThe relationship between socioeconomic status and its interaction with States Medicaid-expansion policies on COVID-19 outcomes across United States (US) counties are uncertain. To determine the association between median-household-income and its interaction with State Medicaid-expansion status on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties

MethodsLongitudinal, retrospective analysis of 3142 US counties (including District of Columbia) to study the relationship between County-level median-household-income (defined by US Census Bureaus Small-Area-Income-and-Poverty-Estimates) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality per 100000 of the population in US counties from January 20, 2020 through December 6, 2020. County median-household-income was log-transformed and stratified by quartiles. Medicaid-expansion status was defined by US States Medicaid-expansion adoption as of first reported US COVID-19 infection, January 20, 2020. Multilevel mixed-effects generalized-linear-model with negative binomial distribution and log link function compared quartiles of median-household-income and COVID-19 incidence and mortality, reported as incidence-risk-ratio (IRR) and mortality-risk-ratio (MRR), respectively. Models adjusted for county socio-demographic and comorbidity conditions, population density, and hospitals, with a random intercept for states. Multiplicative interaction tested for Medicaid-expansion*income quartiles on COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

ResultsThere was no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence across counties by income quartiles or by Medicaid expansion status. Conversely, significant differences exist between COVID-19 mortality by income quartiles and by Medicaid expansion status. The association between income quartiles and COVID-19 mortality was significant only in counties from non-Medicaid-expansion states but not significant in counties from Medicaid-expansion states (P<0.01 for interaction). For non-Medicaid-expansion states, counties in the lowest income quartile had a 41% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared to counties in the highest income quartile (MRR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.25-1.59).

Conclusions and RelevanceMedian-household-income was not related to COVID-19 incidence but negatively related to COVID-19 mortality in US counties of states without Medicaid-expansion. It was unrelated to COVID-19 mortality in counties of states that adopted Medicaid-expansion. These findings suggest that expanded healthcare coverage should be investigated further to attenuate the excessive COVID-19 mortality risk associated with low-income communities.

Key FindingsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there a relationship between COVID-19 outcomes (incidence and mortality) and household income and status of Medicaid expansion of US counties?

FindingsIn this longitudinal, retrospective analysis of 3142 US counties, we found no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence across US counties by quartiles of household income. However, counties with lower median household income had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, but only in non-Medicaid expansion states.

59,Impact of Vaccination and Testing in an Urban Campus model for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"The crisis induced by the Coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted educational institutes. Even with vaccination efforts underway, it is not clear that sufficient confidence will be achieved for schools to reopen soon.

This paper considers the impact of vaccination rates and testing rates to reduce infections and hospitalizations and evaluates strategies that will allow educational institute in urban settings to reopen. These strategies are also applicable to businesses and would help plan reopening in order to help the economy.

Our analysis is based on a graph model where nodes represent population groups and edges represent population exchanges due to commuting populations. The commuting population is associated with edges and is associated with one of the end nodes of the edge during part of the time period and with the other node during the remainder of the time period. The progression of the disease at each node is determined via compartment models, that include vaccination rates and testing to place infected people in quarantine along with consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. Applying this to a university population in Chicago with a substantial commuter population, chosen to be 80% as an illustration, provides an analysis which specifies benefits of testing and vaccination strategies over a time period of 150 days.",Sanjiv Kapoor; Yi Zhang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251040,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251040,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
60,Age-related heterogeneity in Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following BNT162b2 vaccination,"Vaccines remain the cornerstone for containing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. mRNA vaccines provide protection in clinical trials using a two-dose approach, separated by a three-week gap. Here we assessed real world immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2. Following the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, we measured IFN{gamma} T cell responses, both total IgG Spike/ IgG Spike RBD and neutralising antibody responses to Spike in sera using a lentiviral pseudotyping system. Median age was 82 amongst 26 participants. Three weeks after the first dose a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved adequate neutralisation titre of >1:4 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 (8/15 versus 11/11, p<0.05). Mean neutralisation titres in this age group after the first dose were lower than in younger individuals (p<0.05). Following the second dose, neutralising antibody response 50% titres were above 1:4 in all individuals and there was no longer a difference by age grouping. A significant proportion of individuals over 80 appear to require a second dose of vaccine, given in this study at three weeks, to achieve virus neutralisation.",Dami Collier; Isabella Ferreira; Rawlings Datir; Bo Meng; Laura Bergamaschi; - The CITIID-NIHR Bioresource COVID-19 Collaboration; Anne Elmer; Nathalie Kingston; Barbara Graves; Barbara Graves; Kenneth GC Smith; John Bradley; Paul Lyons; Lourdes Ceron-Gutierrez; Gabriela Barcenas-Morales; Rainer Doffinger; Mark Wills; Ravindra K Gupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251054,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251054,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
61,Risk Factors for Infection and Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Autoimmune Diseases,"BackgroundPeople with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions who take immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have a higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences.

ObjectiveAssess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterize pandemic-associated changes to care.

DesignLongitudinal registry study

Participants4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins

MeasurementsPeriodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare

ResultsA total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Pandemic-related disruption to care was common. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions. Individuals experiencing changes to employment or income were at highest odds of care disruption.

LimitationsResults may not be generalizable to all patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Information was self-reported.

62,Increased SAR-CoV-2 shedding associated with reduced disease severity despite continually emerging genetic variants,"Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, genetic variants have continued to emerge, complicating strategies for mitigating the disease burden of COVID-19. Positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs (n=8,735) were collected from Missouri, USA, from March-October 2020, and viral genomes (n=178) were sequenced. Hospitalization status and length of stay were extracted from medical charts of 1,335 patients and integrated with emerging genetic variants and viral shedding analyses for assessment of clinical impacts. Multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Missouri, primarily from Australia, Europe, and domestic states, were observed. Four local lineages rapidly emerged and spread across urban and rural regions in Missouri. While the majority of Missouri viruses harbored Spike-D614G mutations, a large number of unreported mutations were identified among Missouri viruses, including seven in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex and Spike protein that were positively selected. A 15.6-fold increase in viral RNA levels in swab samples occurred from March to May and remained elevated. Accounting for other comorbidities, individuals test-positive for COVID-19 with high viral loads were less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.20, 0.77) and had shorter hospital stays (hazard ratio=0.34, p=0.003) than those with low viral loads. Overall, the first eight months of the pandemic in Missouri saw multiple locally acquired mutants emerge and dominate in urban and rural locations. Although we were unable to find associations between specific variants and greater disease severity, Missouri COVID-positive individuals that presented with increased viral shedding had less severe disease by several measures.",Cynthia Y Tang; Yang Wang; Cheng Gao; David R Smith; Jane A McElroy; Tao Li; Karen Segovia; Tricia Haynes; Richard Hammer; Christopher Sampson; Detlef Ritter; Christopher Schulze; Robin Trotman; Grace M Lidl; Richard Webby; Jun Hang; Xiu-Feng Wan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250928,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250928,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
63,Antibody responses boosted in seropositive healthcare workers after single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine,"Current guidelines recommend that individuals who have had COVID-19 should receive the identical vaccine regimen as those who have not had the infection. This includes two doses of the mRNA platform vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer; mRNA-1273/Moderna) that are approved for use in the United States. In this brief report, we show that after a single dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, individuals that had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly higher antibody levels than individuals that had no history of infection. This provides the rationale for changing vaccination policy to deliver only a single dose to individuals with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection that may free up additional doses for individuals that have no preexisting immunity to the virus. Future study of other immune parameters such as T cell response and durability of immune response should be rapidly undertaken in individuals that had COVID-19 prior to vaccination.",Todd Bradley; - CODIEFY study team; Elin Grundberg; Rangaraj Selvarangan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251078,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251078,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

While there is evidence for autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we established a prospective observational cohort to study lung specific autoantibodies (auto-Abs). Incubation of plasma from severe COVID-19 patients with healthy human lung tissue revealed the presence of IgA antibodies binding to surfactant-producing pneumocytes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and protein pull-downs using porcine surfactant confirmed the presence of auto-Abs binding to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Mass spectrometry and ELISAs with recombinant proteins identified IgA auto-Abs that target human surfactant proteins B and C. In line with these findings, lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients showed reduced pulmonary surfactant.

65,Infection and mRNA-1273 vaccine antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 UK variant,"Antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein correlate with protection against COVID-19. Serum neutralizing antibodies appear early after symptom onset following SARS-CoV-2 infection and can last for several months. Similarly, the messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, generates serum neutralizing antibodies that are detected through at least day 119. However, the recent emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant has raised significant concerns about the breadth of these neutralizing antibody responses. In this study, we used a live virus neutralization assay to compare the neutralization potency of sera from infected and vaccinated individuals against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. We found that both infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies were effective at neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. These findings support the notion that in the context of the UK variant, vaccine-induced immunity can provide protection against COVID-19. As additional SARS-CoV-2 viral variants continue to emerge, it is crucial to monitor their impact on neutralizing antibody responses following infection and vaccination.",Venkata Viswanadh Edara; Katharine Floyd; Lilin Lai; Meredith Gardner; William Hudson; Anne Piantadosi; Jesse Waggoner; Ahmed Babiker; Rafi Ahmed; Xuping Xie; Kumari Lokugamage; Vineet Menachery; Pei-Yong Shi; - COVID-19 Neutralization Study Group; Mehul S Suthar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250799,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250799,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
66,SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are lower in children and increase with age and time after infection,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of children leads to a mild illness and the immunological differences with adults remains unclear. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines. Acute and memory CD4+ T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly increased with age, whilst CD8+ T cell responses increased with time post infection. Infected children had significantly lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In infected adults CD4+ T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies to {beta}-coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults. Therefore, reduced prior {beta}-coronavirus immunity and reduced activation and recruitment of de novo responses in children may drive milder COVID-19 pathogenesis.",Carolyn A Cohen; Athena PY Li; Asmaa Hachim; David SC Hui; Mike YW Kwan; Owen TY Tsang; Susan S Chiu; Wai Hung Chan; Yat Sun Yau; Niloufar Kavian; Fionn NL Ma; Eric HY Lau; Samuel MS Cheng; Leo LM Poon; Malik JS Peiris; Sophie A Valkenburg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250988,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250988,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
67,Impact of systemic corticosteroids on hospitalized patients with COVID-19: January 2021 Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a myriad of potential therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids. The first RCT reporting results on the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the RECOVERY trial published in July, 2020. The RECOVERY trial showed a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received oral or intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days.

This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the analysis process.

MethodsMeta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing systemic corticosteroids to usual care or placebo.

ResultsFive English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7645 hospitalized patients worldwide using systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. Three RCTs were discontinued when preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial became available.

Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to usual care or placebo (Odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.05, p = 0.09). Subgroup analysis from the 1967 critically ill patients in the identified RCTs showed improved survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy (Odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.87, p = 0.01).

ConclusionsThis meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The early termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis.

68,Arabic validation and cross-cultural adaptation of the 5C scale for assessment of COVID-19 vaccines psychological antecedents,"BackgroundIn the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.

MethodsThe 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then subsequently translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged [&ge;]18 years) were included in the final analysis. Convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha.

ResultsAge of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females, 37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from UAE, and 30% were healthcare workers. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha [&ge;]0.7). Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-total correlation (P<0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix (<0.7). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA=0.060,GFI=0.924, CFI=0.957, TLI=0.937, SRMR=0.076 & NFI=906).

We describe a study on bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated (MV) COVID-19 patients outlining the procedural, clinical, utilitarian and safety aspects.

MethodsBedside bronchoscopy was performed in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases on MV; only positive cases were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, bronchoscopic and laboratory findings were noted and analysed.

Results98 procedures were performed on 61 patients, mean age of 62.1 years, 51 (83.6%) males. 42 patients (69%) had at least 1 co-morbidity. Major indications for bronchoscopy were new radiographic infiltrates with clinical deterioration, increased endotracheal tube (ETT) secretions and haemorrhagic secretions/hemoptysis. Common findings were copious secretions in 87 (88.8%), purulent in 61%, mucoid in 18%, haemorrhagic in 7% and frothy in 14% cases. Morphologically, hyperaemic airways were seen in 85 (86.7%) cases, ranging from mild (61%) to moderate-severe (39%). On the management front, antibiotics were changed in 31 (31.6%) cases based on bronchoscopic findings. Other significant changes included reduction or stopping of steroids and anticoagulation, fluid, and diuretic adjustment and ETT repositioning. The incidence of bacterial superinfection was also high (54% culture positivity for various bacteria), a significant number (94%) with multi-drug resistant organisms. Fungi were seen in 7 cases (7.1%). Pneumocystis jiroveci was not seen and cytology did not show any viral inclusions. Therapeutic mucus plug removal was done in 30 cases (30.6%), and hemoptysis control in 4% cases. The procedures were safe with no complications, and none of the HCW developed any COVID19 infection.

Many studies have reported the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 transmission by utilizing the spatial-temporal information of mobility data from various sources. To better understand the role of human mobility in the pandemic, we conducted a systematic review of articles that measure the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 in terms of their data sources, statistical models, and key findings. Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we selected 47 articles from Web of Science Core Collection up to September 2020. Restricting human mobility reduced the transmission of COVID-19 spatially, although the effectiveness and stringency of policy implementation vary temporally and spatially across different stages of the pandemic. We call for prompt and sustainable measures to control the pandemic. We also recommend researchers 1) to enhance multi-disciplinary collaboration; 2) to adjust the implementation and stringency of mobility-control policies in corresponding to the rapid change of the pandemic; 3) to improve statistical models used in analyzing, simulating, and predicting the transmission of the disease; and 4) to enrich the source of mobility data to ensure data accuracy and suability.",Mengxi Zhang; Siqin Wang; Tao Hu; Xiaokang Fu; Xiaoyue Wang; Yaxin Hu; Briana Halloran; Yunhe Cui; Haokun Liu; Zhimin Liu; Shuming Bao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250889,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250889,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

DESIGNThis is an institutional review board approved cohort study in patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit admission. Patients admitted and requiring oxygen supplementation were treated with either methylprednisolone or dexamethasone.

SETTINGThis study takes place in the intensive care units at a large, tertiary, public teaching hospital serving a primarily low-income community in urban Los Angeles.

PATIENTSAll eligible patients admitted to the intensive care unit for COVID-19 respiratory failure from March 1 to July 31, 2020 were included in this study.

INTERVENTIONSA total of 262 patients were grouped as receiving usual care (n=75), methylprednisolone dosed at least at 1mg/kg/day for [&ge;] 3 days (n=104), or dexamethasone dosed at least at 6 mg for [&ge;] 7 days (n=83).

MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTSAll-cause mortality within 50 days of initial corticosteroid treatment as compared to usual care was calculated. The mortality effect was then stratified based on levels of respiratory support received by the patient.

In this cohort of 262 patients with severe COVID-19, all-cause mortalities in the usual care, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone groups were 41.3%, 16.4% and 26.5% at 50 days (p <0.01) respectively. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 42% lower in the methylprednisolone group than in the dexamethasone group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI: 0.235-0.956, p=0.0385).

72,A Dynamic Bayesian Model for Identifying High-Mortality Risk in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"IntroductionAs COVID-19 hospitalization rates remain high, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic factors to improve treatment. Our analysis, to our knowledge, is one of the first to quantify the risk associated with dynamic clinical measurements taken throughout the course of hospitalization.

MethodsWe collected data for 553 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital whose eventual outcomes were known. The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients laboratory values.

ResultsFrom the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk. The lab values upon admission most associated with mortality included neutrophil percentage, RBC, RDW, protein levels, platelets count, albumin levels and MCHC. Incorporating dynamic changes in lab values throughout hospitalization lead to dramatic gains in the predictive accuracy of the model and indicated a catalogue of variables for determining high-risk patients including eosinophil percentage, WBC, platelets, pCO2, RDW, LUC count, alkaline phosphatase and albumin.

ConclusionOur prognostic model highlights the nuance of determining risk for COVID-19 patients and indicates that, rather than a single variable, a range of factors (at different points in hospitalization) are needed for effective risk stratification.",Amir Momeni-Boroujeni; Rachelle Mendoza; Isaac J.

ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the risk associations between Covid-19 infection and thromboembolism.

DesignThis is a self-controlled case-series study in Scotland. Their incidence rates during the risk interval (5 days before to 56 days after the positive test) and the control interval (the remaining periods) were compared intra-personally.

SettingPopulation-based.

ParticipantsIndividuals with confirmed (positive test) Covid-19 and at least one thromboembolic event between March 2018 and October 2020.

ExposureCovid-19 test positive.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresMyocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) hospital admissions and deaths.

ResultsAcross Scotland, 1,449 individuals tested positive for Covid-19 and experienced a thromboembolic event. The risk of thromboembolism was significantly elevated over the whole risk period but highest in the 7 days following the positive test (IRR 12.01, 95% CI 9.91-14.56), especially among people [&le;]75 years (IRR 22.78, 95% CI 17.58-29.53). Risk of MI, stroke, PE and DVT were all significantly higher in the week following a positive test. The risk of PE and DVT was particularly high and remained significantly elevated even 56 days following the test.

Conclusions and relevanceConfirmed Covid-19 infection was associated with early elevated risk of MI, ischaemic stroke, and stronger and long elevations in risk with DVT and PE, reinforcing the need to consider monitoring and early diagnosis. Treatment and prevention trials may need to be considered out of hospital on the basis of risk stratification.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes Covid-19 infection increase the risk of thromboembolism?

FindingsAmong 1,449 individuals in Scotland who were tested positive of Covid-19 and had at least one thromboembolic events, the risk of thromboembolism was significantly elevated in the 7 days following the positive test (IRR 12.01, 95% CI 9.91-14.56). The risk of PE and DVT was particularly high and remained significantly elevated even 56 days following the test.

74,GPS-estimated foot traffic data and venue selection for COVID-19 serosurveillance studies,"1Tracking the dynamics and spread of COVID-19 is critical to mounting an effective response to the pandemic. In the absence of randomized representative serological surveys, many SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies have relied on convenience sampling to estimate cumulative incidence. One common approach is to recruit at frequently visited community locations (""venue-based"" sampling), but the sources of bias and uncertainty associated with this strategy are still poorly understood. Here, we used data from a venue-based community serosurveillance study, GPS-estimated foot traffic data, and data on confirmed COVID-19 cases to report an estimate of cumulative incidence in Somerville, Massachusetts, and a methodological strategy to quantify and reduce uncertainty in serology-based cumulative incidence estimates obtained via convenience sampling. The mismatch between the geographic distribution of participants home locations (the ""participant catchment distribution"") and the geographic distribution of infections is an important determinant of uncertainty in venue-based and other convenience sampling strategies. We found that uncertainty in cumulative incidence estimates can vary by a factor of two depending how well the participant catchment distribution matches the known or expected geographic distribution of prior infections. GPS-estimated business foot traffic data provides an important proxy measure for the participant catchment area and can be used to select venue locations that minimize uncertainty in cumulative incidence.",Tyler S Brown; Pablo Martinez de Salazar Munoz; Abhishek Bhatia; Bridget Bunda; Ellen K Williams; David Bor; James S Miller; Amir Mohareb; Vivek Naranbai; Wilfredo Garcia Beltran; Tyler E Miller; Julia Thierauf; Wenxin Yang; Doug Kress; Kristen Stelljes; Keith Johnson; Daniel B Larremore; Jochen Lennerz; A.

75,"COVID19-related and all-cause mortality among middle-aged and older adults across the first epidemic wave of SARS-COV-2 infection in the region of Tarragona, Spain: results from the COVID19 TARRACO Cohort Study, March-June 2020.","BackgroundDirect and indirect COVID19-related mortality is uncertain. This study investigated COVID19-related and all-cause deaths among middle-aged and older adults during the first wave of COVID19 epidemic period, assessing mortality risks by pre-existing socio-demographic and medical underlying conditions.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study involving 79,083 individuals [&ge;]50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Baseline cohort characteristics (age/sex, comorbidities and medications/vaccinations history) were established at study start (01/03/2020) and main outcomes were COVID19-related deaths (occurred in patients diagnosed with the disease) and all-cause deaths occurred among cohort members between 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Mortality risks were assessed by Cox regression analyses.

ResultsCohort members were followed for 1,356,358 persons-weeks, occurring 576 all-cause deaths (124 COVID19-related). All-cause mortality rate was 42.5 deaths per 100,000 persons-week, being 22.8 in healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, 236.4 in COVID19-excluded/PCR-negative subjects, 493.7 in COVID19-compatible/PCR-unperformed subjects and 4009.1 in COVID19-confirmed patients. In multivariable analyses, increasing age, sex male, nursing-home residence, cancer, neurologic, cardiac or liver disease, receiving diuretics, systemic corticosteroids, proton-pump inhibitors and benzodiazepines were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality; conversely, receiving renin-angiotensin inhibitors and statins were associated with reduced risk. Age/years, sex male and nursing-home residence were strong predictors for COVID19-related mortality, but none comorbidity appeared significantly associated with an increased risk.

ConclusionApart from direct COVID19-related deaths (which represented almost 22% of all-cause mortality), theoretically COVID19-excluded patients (PCR-negative) suffered considerable greater all-cause mortality than healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, which could explain, in part, the large excess deaths observed across the COVID19 pandemic.",Angel Vila-corcoles; Eva Satue-Gracia; Angel Vila-Rovira; Cinta de Diego-Cabanes; Maria Jose Forcadell-Peris; Olga Ochoa-Gondar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251028,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251028,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
76,How did COVID-19 measures impact sexual behaviour and access to STI&HIV services in Panama? Results from a national cross-sectional online survey,"ObjectiveTo describe changes in sexual behaviours, including virtual sex (sexting and cybersex), and access to STI&HIV testing and care during COVID-19 measures in Panama.

MethodWe conducted an online cross-sectional survey from August 8 to September 12, 2020, among adults ([&ge;]18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to STI&HIV testing and HIV care and sexual behaviours three months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes.

ResultWe recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men, and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender; median age was 28y (IQR:23-37y), 531/957 (55.5%) were of mixed-ethnicity (mixed-Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181/470) cis-women, 58.4% (184/315) cis-men and 45.0% (27/60) non-binary participants; during COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230/800 [28.8%] of participants reported decreased casual sex compared to pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared to pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex were reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared to cis-women (39.2% versus 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.57-3.01); and by Afro-descendant compared to mixed-ethnicity participants (40.0% versus 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.07-2.94). Compared to no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increase in virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.10-2.88); and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95%CI:7.74-35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, STI&HIV testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58/100) participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8/15) HIV-positive participants.

77,Ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality during the first two waves of the Coronavirus Pandemic: a nationwide cohort study of 29 million adults in England,"BackgroundEthnic minorities have experienced disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates in the UK and many other countries. We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves.

MethodsUsing data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset on individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We estimated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions.

ResultsThe study population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7 - 376.2] and 166.8 [141.7 - 191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4 - 390.1] and 127.1 [91.1 - 171.3] in men and women)background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves.

ConclusionBetween the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA recent systematic review by Pan and colleagues demonstrated that people of ethnic minority background in the UK and the USA have been disproportionately affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, compared to White populations. While several studies have investigated whether adjusting for socio-demographic and economic factors and medical history reduces the estimated difference in risk of mortality and hospitalisation, the reasons for the differences in the risk of experiencing harms from COVID-19 are still being explored during the course of the pandemic. Studies so far have analysed the ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave of the pandemic. The evidence on the temporal trend of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality, especially those from the second wave of the pandemic, is scarce.

Added value of this studyUsing data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Data Asset on 29 million adults aged 30-100 years living in private households in England, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine the differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We find that in the first wave all ethnic minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death attenuated for Black African and Black Caribbean groups, remained substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi background, and worsened in people from Pakistani background. We also find that some of the factors explaining these differences in mortality have changed in the two waves.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of COVID-19 mortality during the first wave of the pandemic was elevated in people from ethnic minority background. An appreciable reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality in the second wave of the pandemic between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group is reassuring, but the continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy response. Focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. Focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities in COVID-19 mortality.",Vahe Nafilyan; Nazrul Islam; Rohini Mathur; Daniel Ayoubkhani; Amitava Banerjee; Myer Glickman; Ben Humberstone; Ian DIamond; Kamlesh Khunti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251004,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251004,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
78,Using a household structured branching process to analyse contact tracing in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"We explore strategies of contact tracing, case isolation and quarantine of exposed contacts to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic using a branching process model with household structure. This structure reflects higher transmission risks among household members than among non-household members, and is also the level at which physical distancing policies have been applied. We explore implementation choices that make use of household structure, and investigate strategies including two-step tracing, backwards tracing, smartphone tracing and tracing upon symptom report rather than test results. The primary model outcome is the effect on the growth rate of the epidemic under contact tracing in combination with different levels of physical distancing, and we investigate epidemic extinction times to indicate the time period over which interventions must be sustained. We consider effects of non-uptake of isolation/quarantine, non-adherence, and declining recall of contacts over time. We find that compared to self-isolation of cases but no contact tracing, a household-based contact tracing strategy allows for some relaxation of physical distancing measures; however, it is unable to completely control the epidemic in the absence of other measures. Even assuming no imported cases and sustainment of moderate distancing, testing and tracing efforts, the time to bring the epidemic to extinction could be in the order of months to years.",Martyn Fyles; Elizabeth Fearon; Christopher Overton; - University of Manchester COVID-19 Working Group; Tom Wingfield; Graham F Medley; Ian Hall; Lorenzo Pellis; Thomas House,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250992,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250992,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
79,"Field performance evaluation of the PanBio rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay in an epidemic driven by 501Y.v2 (lineage B.1.351) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa","BackgroundSouth Africa was the African country most severely affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during 2020, experiencing 2 waves of infection. During the first wave, diagnostics were largely based on reverse transcription-linked PCR (RT-PCR). The Abbott PanBio antigen test was deployed during the 2nd wave which was driven by emergence of the 501Y.v2 variant. At the time of evaluation in mid-November 2020, 501Y.v2 was the dominant circulating virus in Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape Province.

MethodsA prospective diagnostic evaluation study was undertaken, during a period of high community transmission, to evaluate the field performance of the PanBio antigen RTD. Testing was conducted at mobile community testing centres on 677 ambulant patients seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing. RT-PCR was performed on the original naso-pharyngeal antigen swabs to evaluate test performance.

ResultsOf 146 RT-PCR positive individuals, 101 were RTD positive in the clinic. The antigen RTD had an overall sensitivity of 69.2% (95%CI 61.4, 75.8) and specificity of 99.0% (95%CI 98.8, 99.3) in this clinical context. Sensitivity was strongly dependent on the amount of virus in clinical samples, as reflected by the PCR cycle threshold (CT) value, with 100% detection in samples where the CT was <20, 96% with CT between 20-25, 89% with CT between 26-30 and 64% when CT was 31-35.

ConclusionsThe assay reliably detected 501Y.v2 infections in ambulatory ill patients. Assay sensitivity was >90% in patients with high viral loads who are expected to be most infectious.

80,Newborn antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detected in cord blood after maternal vaccination,"BackgroundMaternal vaccination for Influenza and TDaP have been well studied in terms of safety and efficacy for protection of the newborn by placental passage of antibodies. Similar newborn protection would be expected after maternal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19). There is a significant and urgent need for research regarding safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Here, we report the first known case of an infant with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detectable in cord blood after maternal vaccination.

Case presentationA vigorous, healthy, full-term female was born to a COVID-19 naive mother who had received a single dose of mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 three weeks prior to delivery. Cord blood antibodies (IgG) were detected to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 at time of delivery.

81,Intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine: Results from a population-based survey in Canada,"ObjectiveThe success of any COVID-19 vaccine program ultimately depends on high vaccine uptake. This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and identified factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada.

MethodsIndividuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia aged 25-69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Two multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsOf 4,528 respondents, 79.8% intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In multivariable modeling, respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine attitudinal scores (p <0.001), reported greater influence of direct social norms (p = 0.001), and indirect social norms, including their family physician (p = 0.024), and Provincial Health Officer (p = 0.011). Older individuals (>60 years) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine, while females (95%CI 0.57,0.93), those with less than high school education (95%CI 0.5,0.76), those who self-identified as non-white (95%CI 0.60,0.92), self-identified as Indigenous (95%CI 0.36,0.84) and essential non-health care workers (95%CI 0.59,0.86) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsTo optimize vaccine coverage, public health should focus on key messages around vaccine safety and benefit, and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging. As certain key populations report a lower intention to vaccinate, there is a need for in-depth education and support for these communities to ensure optimal uptake.",Gina Ogilvie; Shanlea Gordon; Laurie Smith; Arianne Albert; Amy Booth; C Sarai Racey; Anna Gottschlich; David M Goldfarb; Melanie C.

83,Evaluation of individual and ensemble probabilistic forecasts of COVID-19 mortality in the US,"Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. In 2020, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized hundreds of thousands of specific predictions from more than 50 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. This manuscript systematically evaluates 23 models that regularly submitted forecasts of reported weekly incident COVID-19 mortality counts in the US at the state and national level. One of these models was a multi-model ensemble that combined all available forecasts each week. The performance of individual models showed high variability across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a naive baseline model. In combining the forecasts from all teams, the ensemble showed the best overall probabilistic accuracy of any model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions farther into the future, with probabilistic accuracy at a 20-week horizon more than 5 times worse than when predicting at a 1-week horizon.

Efficient sequencing strategies enabling the retrieval of the maximum number of high quality, full-length genomes are hence indispensable. Here, we describe for the first time a combined approach of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and NGS to evaluate five commercially available sequence capture panels targeting SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we were not only able to determine the most sensitive and specific capture panel, but to discriminate their mode of action and number of read pairs needed to recover a high quality full length genome.

85,SARS-CoV-2 ORF7b: is a bat virus protein homologue a major cause of COVID-19 symptoms?,"ORF7b is an accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic. Using cell-free synthesized ORF7b, we experimentally show that ORF7b assembles into stable multimers. The ORF7b sequence shows a transmembrane segment, which multimerizes through a leucine zipper. We hypothesize that ORF7b has the potential to interfere with important cellular processes that involve leucine-zipper formation, and present two particularly striking examples. First, leucine zippers are central in heart rhythm regulation through multimerization of phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Second, epithelial cell-cell adhesion relies on E-cadherins, which dimerize using a transmembrane leucine zipper. Most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including heart arrythmias, odor loss, impaired oxygen uptake and intestinal problems, up to multiorgan failure, can be rationalized by a possible interference of ORF7b with the functions of these proteins.

86,Collaboration between the Fab and Fc contribute to maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates following NVX-CoV2373 subunit vaccine with Matrix-M™ vaccination,"Recently approved vaccines have already shown remarkable protection in limiting SARS-CoV-2 associated disease. However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, as well as how boosting alters immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels, administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M. While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

87,Post-infection treatment with a protease inhibitor increases survival of mice with a fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to be a serious global public health threat. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a virus protease encoded by SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for virus replication. We have previously reported a series of small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors effective for inhibiting replication of human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in animal models. Here we generated a series of deuterated variants of a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, and evaluated the antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. The deuterated GC376 displayed potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the enzyme and the cell-based assays. The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and was proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 hr post infection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Structural investigation using high-resolution crystallography illuminated binding interactions of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with deuterated variants of GC376. Taken together, deuterated GC376 variants have excellent potential as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.",Chamandi Dampalla; Jian Zheng; Krishani Perera; Lok Yin Roy Wong; David Meyerholz; Harry Nguyen; Maithri Kashipathy; Kevin Battaile; Scott Lovell; Yunjeong Kim; Stanley Perlman; William Groutas; Kyeong-Ok Chang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429937,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429937,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
88,Protein glycosylation is essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 extensively N-glycosylates its surface spike (S) proteins. This post-translational modification is essential to modulate protein conformation and host cell invasion. Each S monomer can be modified with up to 22 N-glycans. To meet the high demand of protein glycosylation during virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 upregulates the expression of host N-glycosylation genes. Although a substantial amount of detail is known about the structure of S protein N-glycans, the role of N-glycosylation in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely undetermined. Here, we investigated the essentiality of the host N-glycosylation pathway and viral N-glycans for SARS-CoV-2 infection. When either monkey or human cells were preincubated with glycosylation inhibitors, including FDA-approved iminosugars, virus infection was significantly reduced. This infection phenotype was confirmed after RNAi knockdown of several glycosylation genes. In addition, enzymatic deglycosylation of whole viral particles confirmed that accessible oligosaccharides on the SARS-CoV-2 surface are essential for host cell infection. Altogether, we show evidence that the normal functioning of the host N- glycosylation machinery is essential not only for SARS-CoV-2 to infect, but also to produce new functional virions. These findings open the door for developing new approaches targeting N-glycosylation against COVID-19.",Aitor Casas-Sanchez; Alessandra Romero-Ramirez; Eleanor Hargreaves; Edward I Patterson; Grant L Hughes; Tobias Zech; Alvaro Acosta-Serrano,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429940,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429940,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
89,Serological Profile Of Specific Antibodies Against Dominant Antigens Of SARS-CoV-2 In Chilean COVID-19 Patients.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has been a pandemic since March 2020. Currently, the virus has infected more than 50 million people worldwide and more than half a million in Chile. For many coronaviruses, Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins are described as major antigenic molecules, inducing seroconversion and production of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we evaluated the presence in serum of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using western blot, and developed an ELISA test for the qualitative characterization of COVID-19 patients. Patients with an active infection or who have recovered from COVID-19 showed specific immunoblotting patterns for the recombinants S protein and its domains S1 and S2, as well as for the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-N antibodies were more frequently detected than anti-S or anti-S1-RBD antibodies. People who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 did not show reactivity. Finally, indirect ELISA assays using N and S1-RBD proteins, alone or in combination, were established with variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the antigen bound to the solid phase. Overall, Spike showed higher specificity than the nucleocapsid, and comparable sensitivity for both antigens. Both approaches confirmed the seroconversion after infection and allowed us to implement the analysis of antibodies in blood for research purposes in a local facility.",Karina Cereceda; Roxana Gonzalez-Stegmaier; Jose Luis Briones; Carolina Selman; Adam Aguirre; Guillermo Valenzuela-Nieto; Christian Caglevic; Raimundo Gazitua; Alejandro Rojas-Fernandez; Franz Villaroel-Espíndola,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429566,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429566,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
90,Furin cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is modulated by O-glycosylation,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the global pandemic contains a unique furin cleavage site in the spike protein (S) that increases viral infectivity and syncytia formation. Here, we show that O-glycosylation near the furin cleavage site is mediated by specific members of the GALNT enzyme family and is dependent on the novel proline at position 681 (P681). We further demonstrate that O-glycosylation of S decreases furin cleavage. Finally, we show that GALNT family members capable of glycosylating S are expressed in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that O-glycosylation may influence viral infectivity/tropism by modulating furin cleavage of S and provide mechanistic insight into the potential role of P681 mutations in the recently identified, highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant.",Liping Zhang; Matthew Mann; Zulfeqhar Syed; Hayley M.

92,Can a COVID-19 vaccination program guarantee the return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle?,"COVID-19 vaccination has been initiated in several countries to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Whether and when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can be lifted as vaccination builds up remains key questions. To address them, we built a data-driven SARS-CoV-2 transmission model for China. We estimated that, to prevent local outbreaks to escalate to major widespread epidemics, stringent NPIs need to remain in place at least one year after the start of vaccination. Should NPIs be capable to keep the reproduction number (Rt) around 1.3, vaccination could reduce up to 99% of COVID-19 burden and bring Rt below the epidemic threshold in 9 months. Maintaining strict NPIs throughout 2021 is of paramount importance to reduce COVID-19 burden while vaccines are distributed, especially in large populations with little natural immunity.",Juan Yang; Valentina Marziano; Xiaowei Deng; Giorgio Guzzetta; Juanjuan Zhang; Filippo Trentini; Jun Cai; Piero Poletti; Wen Zheng; Wei Wang; Qianhui Wu; Zeyao Zhao; Kaige Dong; Guangjie Zhong; Cecile Viboud; Stefano Merler; Marco Ajelli; Hongjie Yu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251108,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251108,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

95,Estimation of infection rate and the population size potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Japan during 2020,"BackgroundThe infectious respiratory disease COVID-19, caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached pandemic status during 2020. The primary statistic data are important to survey the actual circumstances of COVID-19. Here, we report the analysis of the primary data of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020.

MethodsData were collected and released systematically under Japan domestic law. Machine learning was conducted to estimate the positive rate in Japan and four prefectures (Tokyo, Osaka, Chiba, and Fukuoka).

ResultsPrimary data analysis revealed there were at least two peaks of infection in Japan; the first one was during April 2020 and the second one started from November 1, 2020. Estimating the positive rate in Japan as well as in the four prefectures reinforced the above observations. The positive rate in Japan during 2020 was estimated to be around 6% to 8%. We also estimated that 1.95 million people were possibly exposed to the novel virus on October 31, 2020. The numbers of related deaths were over 3,000 people at the end of 2020.

ConclusionWe estimated the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan to be 6-8% in 2020. We also concluded that Japan had at least two infection-spreading periods, the first one being from Jan 19, 2020 until May 2020, and the second one beginning from November 1, 2020.

96,The mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily shaped by the host antiviral defense,"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution is a fundamental effort in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are the two inter-dependent mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i) antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins and (ii) probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 genomes are evolving worldwide. Revealing the evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand host-virus interactions. Here, we aim to understand whether mutagenesis or selection is the primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This study provides an unbiased computational method for profiling and analyzing independently occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

97,The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and the dynamics of the S gene furin cleavage site in primary human airway epithelia,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the devastating ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which poses a great threat to global public health. The spike (S) polypeptide of SARS-CoV-2 consists of the S1 and S2 subunits and is processed by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 boundary. The inclusion of the 4 amino acids (PRRA) at the S1/S2 boundary forms a furin cleavage site (FCS), 682RRAR{downarrow}S686, distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its closest relative, the SARS-CoV. Various deletions surrounding the FCS have been identified in patients. When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, the virus acquired various deletions surrounding the FCS. In the present study, we studied the viral transcriptome in SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability at the S1/S2 boundary using RNA-seq. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the S1/S2 boundary of the S gene: one is a deletion of 12 amino acids, 678TNSPRRAR{downarrow}SVAS689, which contains the FCS, another is a deletion of 5 amino acids, 675QTQTN679, which is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the S gene stability in HAE-ALI but with exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are remained at a high rate. Thus, our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is donor-dependent.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429670,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429670,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False

Tools to visualize viral RNA directly in infected cells are critical to analyze its replication cycle, screen for therapeutic molecules or study infections in human tissue. Here, we report the design, validation and initial application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes to visualize positive or negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaFISH). We demonstrate sensitive visualization of vRNA in African green monkey and several human cell lines, in patient samples and human tissue. We further demonstrate the adaptation of CoronaFISH probes to electron microscopy (EM). We provide all required oligonucleotide sequences, source code to design the probes, and a detailed protocol.

99,"Targeted in situ cross-linking mass spectrometry and integrative modeling reveal the architectures of Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nucleocapsid proteins from SARS-CoV-2","Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell. Here, we applied targeted in situ CLMS to structurally probe Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins from SARS-CoV-2, and obtained cross-link sets with an average density of one cross-link per twenty residues. We then employed integrative modeling that computationally combined the cross-linking data with domain structures to determine full-length atomic models. For the Nsp2, the cross-links report on a complex topology with long-range interactions. Integrative modeling with structural prediction of individual domains by the AlphaFold2 system allowed us to generate a single consistent all-atom model of the full-length Nsp2. The model reveals three putative metal binding sites, and suggests a role for Nsp2 in zinc regulation within the replication-transcription complex. For the N protein, we identified multiple intra- and inter-domain cross-links. Our integrative model of the N dimer demonstrates that it can accommodate three single RNA strands simultaneously, both stereochemically and electrostatically. For the Nsp1, cross-links with the 40S ribosome were highly consistent with recent cryo-EM structures.

100,Bronchoalveolar lavage affects thorax computed tomography of healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"Medical imaging as method to assess the longitudinal process of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates is commonly used in research settings. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also regularly used to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities with each other is unknown in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between timepoints in CT score were increased for the second BAL. These results indicate that the effect of BAL on infected lungs is not completed within the first 24 hours. Therefore, it is of importance to acknowledge the interference between BAL and CT in rhesus macaques.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429761,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429761,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False

A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-{beta} production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment.

102,Large-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein mutants demonstrates the need for continuous screening of virus isolates,"Due to the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is evolving in diverse human populations. Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it.

We analyzed 146,920 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 2,393 NGS datasets from GISAID, NCBI Virus and NCBI SRA archives focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 13.6% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.98% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 2,592 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only nine and 23 recurrent variants were found in at least 0.5% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 15.1% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition.

SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S - insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complimentary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.",Ieva Bagdonaite; Andrew J.

104,Extensive recombination-driven coronavirus diversification expands the pool of potential pandemic pathogens,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the third zoonotic coronavirus identified in the last twenty years. Previously, four other known coronaviruses moved from animal reservoirs into humans and now cause primarily mild-to-moderate respiratory disease. The emergence of these viruses likely involved a period of intense transmission before becoming endemic, highlighting the recurrent threat to human health posed by animal coronaviruses. Enzootic and epizootic coronaviruses of diverse lineages pose a significant threat to livestock, as most recently observed for virulent strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine acute diarrhea-associated coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Unique to RNA viruses, coronaviruses encode a proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) that lowers point mutation rates to increase the viability of large RNA virus genomes, which comes with the cost of limiting virus adaptation via point mutation. This limitation can be overcome by high rates of recombination that facilitate rapid increases in genetic diversification. To compare dynamics of recombination between related sequences, we developed an open-source computational workflow (IDPlot) to measure nucleotide identity, locate recombination breakpoints, and infer phylogenetic relationships. We analyzed recombination dynamics among three groups of coronaviruses with impacts on livestock or human health: SARSr-CoV, Betacoronavirus-1, and SADSr-CoV. We found that all three groups undergo recombination with highly diverged viruses, disrupting phylogenetic relationships and revealing contributions of unknown coronavirus lineages to the genetic diversity of established groups. Dynamic patterns of recombination impact inferences of relatedness between diverse coronaviruses and expand the genetic pool that may contribute to future zoonotic events. These results illustrate the limitations of current sampling approaches for anticipating zoonotic threats to human and animal health.",Stephen A. Goldstein; Joe Brown; Brent S Pedersen; Aaron R.

105,Codon arrangement modulates MHC-I peptides presentation: implications for a SARS-CoV-2 peptide-based vaccine,"Among various vaccination strategies, peptide-based vaccines appear as excellent candidates because they are cheap to produce, are highly stable and harbor low toxicity. However, predicting which MHC-I Associated Peptide (MAP) will ultimately reach cell surface remains challenging, due to high false discovery rates. Previously, we demonstrated that synonymous codon arrangement (usage and placement) is predictive of, and modulates MAP presentation. Here, we apply CAMAP (Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor), the artificial neural network we used to unveil the role of codon arrangement in MAP presentation, to predict SARS-CoV MAPs. We report that experimentally identified SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 MAPs are associated with significantly higher CAMAP scores. Based on CAMAP scores and binding affinity, we identified 48 non-overlapping MAP candidates for a peptide-based vaccine, ensuring coverage for a high proportion of HLA haplotypes in the US population (>78%) and SARS-CoV-2 strains (detected in >98% of SARS-CoV-2 strains present in the GISAID database). Finally, we built an interactive web portal (https://www.epitopes.world) where researchers can freely explore CAMAP predictions for SARS-CoV-1/2 viruses. Collectively, we present an analysis framework that can be generalizable to empower the rapid identification of virus-specific MAPs, including in the context of an emergent virus, to help accelerate target identification for peptide-based vaccine designs that could be critical in safely attaining group immunity in the context of a global pandemic.",Tariq Daouda; Maude Dumont-Lagacé; Albert Feghaly; Alexandra-Chloe Villani,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429819,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429819,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
106,"Follow-up of a hospital cohort during the first 3,530 suspected cases of COVID-19 in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil","IntroductionIn a global context, COVID-19 is the most significant health threat in the present days, evidenced by the fact that, in just over four months, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 171 countries, reaching a Pandemic status. Most patients with COVID-19 have a mild course of the disease. However, approximately 20% develop severe illness with a high mortality rate which is associated with age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Epidemiological studies are used to reveal the extent of viral spread in homes, communities, and hospitals. Thus, preventive and control measures can be established by the authorities.

ObjectiveIn this study, patients with suspect COVID-19 symptoms who search for hospital care at the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto (Sao Paulo, Brazil) were monitored, in order to identify the first case of this new disease in the region. In the first two months (March and April), more than 3000 individuals looked for the public and private health system with suspected respiratory symptoms, but only 164 (8.4%) were COVID-19 confirmed.

ResultsFrom those, males (56.1%) and patients of the age distribution of 16-59 (91.2%), with diarrhea (22.2%), runny nose (25%), altered taste (15.9%), and anosmia (11.6%) presented statistical significance, although none comorbidities were related with COVID-19 occurrence. The odds ratio analysis supports this finding.

107,Modulation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-induced Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in HEK293T cells by selected small chemical molecules,"Coronaviruses (CoV) exploits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host cells for replication and in doing so, increases ER stress. evokes Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and possibly autophagy, which could all attribute to the pathophysiology of the viral infections. To date, little is known about the roles of ER stress, UPR, and autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we over-expressed the viral Spike (S) protein in cultured HEK293T cells, as it has been shown that such protein is largely responsible for UPR activation in other CoV-infected cells. We noticed, in the transfected cells, heightened ER stress, activation of the PERK-eIF2 arm of the UPR, induction of autophagy and cell death. When we treated the transfected cells with Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA), Salubrinal, Trazadone hydrochloride, and Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), we saw reduced the BiP/GRP78 levels, but only PBA and TUDCA could significantly diminish the levels of peIF2 and autophagy expression.",Bijina Balakrishnan; Kent Lai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429769,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429769,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
108,IN-HOSPITAL CONTINUATION WITH ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER MORTALITY RATE THAN CONTINUATION WITH ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS IN COVID-19 PATIENTS A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY,"BackgroundSeveral studies have reported a reduced risk of death associated with the inpatient use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in COVID-19 patients, but have been criticized for incurring in several types of bias. Also, most studies have pooled ACEIs and ARBs as if they were a unique group, overlooking their pharmacological differences. We aimed to assess whether the in-hospital continuation of ARBs and ACEIs, in regular users of these drugs, was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared to their discontinuation and also to compare head-to-head ARBs with ACEIs.

MethodsAdult patients with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission during March, 2020 were consecutively selected from 7 hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Among them, we identified outpatient users of ACEIs/ARBs and divided them in two cohorts depending on treatment discontinuation/continuation at admission. Then, they were followed-up until discharge or in-hospital death. An intention-to-treat survival analysis was carried out and hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95%CI were computed through a Cox regression model adjusted for propensity scores of discontinuation and controlled by potential mediators.

ResultsOut of 625 ACEI/ARB users, 340(54.4%) discontinued treatment. The in-hospital mortality rates were 27.6% and 27.7% in discontinuation and continuation cohorts, respectively (HR=1.01; 95%CI:0.70-1.46). No difference in mortality was observed between ARB and ACEI discontinuation (28.6% vs. 27.1%, respectively), while a significantly lower mortality rate was found among patients who continued with ARBs (20.8%,N=125) as compared to those who continued with ACEIs (33.1%,N=136; p=0.03). The head-to-head comparison (ARB vs. ACEI continuation) yielded an adjusted HR of 0.52 (95%CI:0.29-0.93), being especially notorious among males (HR=0.34; 95%CI:0.12-0.93), subjects older than 74 years (HR=0.46; 95%CI:0.25-0.85), and patients with obesity (HR=0.22; 95%CI:0.05-0.94), diabetes (HR=0.36; 95%CI:0.13-0.97) and heart failure (HR=0.12; 95%CI:0.03-0.97).

ConclusionsAmong regular users of ARBs admitted for COVID-19, the in-hospital continuation with them was associated with an improved survival, while this was not observed with ACEIs. Regular users of ARBs should continue with this treatment if admitted for COVID-19, unless medically contraindicated. In admitted ACEI users, a switching to ARBs should be considered, especially among high-risk patients.

109,Stay Home and Stay Active? The impact of stay-at-home restrictions on physical activity routines in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Government restrictions applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK led to the disruption of many peoples physical activity routines, with sports and leisure facilities closed and outdoor exercise only permitted once per day. In this study we investigated which population groups were impacted most in terms of reduced physical activity levels during these periods, and which groups benefitted in terms of increasing their usual level of physical activity. We surveyed UK residents, sampled through users of a rewards-for-exercise app (Sweatcoin; n=749) and an online panel (Prolific; n=907). Of the app users, n=487 further provided daily step-count data collected by the app, prior to, and during the periods of restrictions between March and June 2020. Regression models were applied to investigate factors associated with subjective change (perceived change in physical activity) and objective change (log-percentage change in daily step-count) in physical activity during the periods of restrictions. ANOVAs were used to further investigate the significant factors identified. Key factors associated with a substantial subjective reduction in physical activity included those classed as obese, gym users and people living in urban areas. All participants had a reduced step count during restrictions, with Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, students and urban dwellers showing the largest reductions. Therefore, targeted interventions are required to ensure that the physical and mental health impacts of sedentary behaviour are not exacerbated over the long-term by significant reductions in physical activity identified in these groups, particularly those who are also more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus.",Victoria Eshelby; Muhammed Sogut; Kate Jolly; Ivo Vlaev; Mark T Elliott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250863,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250863,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
110,Returning to a normal life via COVID-19 vaccines in the USA: a large-scale agent-based simulation study,"BackgroundIn 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 300,000 deaths in the US alone. While non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the USA, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the FDA approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy is renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nation-wide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown.

ObjectiveWe study the effectiveness of a nation-wide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines, through six scenarios that capture a range of possible impact from non-pharmaceutical interventions.

MethodsWe use large-scale cloud-based agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using Covasim, an open-source ABM for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity as well as a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose six non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth is fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates are recorded.

ResultsFor both vaccination plans and all non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low at 20%. We noted an unintended consequence: given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections.

ConclusionsAlthough potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Non-pharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance, so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.",Junjiang Li; Philippe Giabbanelli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250872,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250872,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
111,Limited specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at low temperatures,"SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are available within and outside of health care settings to enable increased access to COVID-19 diagnosis. These environments include provisional testing facilities, lacking temperature control; as outside temperatures fall, recommended testing temperatures cannot be guaranteed. We report impaired specificity in two out of six Ag-RDTs when used at 2-4{degrees}C, indicating that testing in cold settings might cause false-positive results potentially entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments and incorrect incidence estimates.",Verena Claudia Haage; Andres Moreira-Soto; Jilian A.

112,Bayesian Calibration of Using CO2 Sensors to Assess Ventilation Conditions and Associated COVID-19 Airborne Aerosol Transmission Risk in Schools,"Ventilation rate plays a significant role in preventing the airborne transmission of diseases in indoor spaces. Classrooms are a considerable challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic because of large occupancy density and mainly poor ventilation conditions. The indoor CO2 level may be used as an index for estimating the ventilation rate and airborne infection risk. In this work, we analyzed a one-day measurement of CO2 levels in three schools to estimate the ventilation rate and airborne infection risk. Sensitivity analysis and Bayesian calibration methods were applied to identify uncertainties and calibrate key parameters. The outdoor ventilation rate with a 95% confidence was 1.96 {+/-} 0.31ACH for Room 1 with mechanical ventilation and fully open window, 0.40 {+/-} 0.08 ACH for Rooms 2, and 0.79 {+/-} 0.06 ACH for Room 3 with only windows open. A time-averaged CO2 level < 450 ppm is equivalent to a ventilation rate > 10 ACH in all three rooms. We also defined the probability of the COVID-19 airborne infection risk associated with ventilation uncertainties. The outdoor ventilation threshold to prevent classroom COVID-19 aerosol spreading is between 3 - 8 ACH, and the CO2 threshold is around 500 ppm of a school day (< 8 hr) for the three schools.

Practical ImplicationsThe actual outdoor ventilation rate in a room cannot be easily measured, but it can be calculated by measuring the transient indoor CO2 level. Uncertainty in input parameters can result in uncertainty in the calculated ventilation rate. Our three classrooms study shows that the estimated ventilation rate considering various input parameters uncertainties is between {+/-} 8-20 %. As a result, the uncertainty of the ventilation rate contributes to the estimated COVID-19 airborne aerosol infection risks uncertainty up to {+/-} 10 %. Other studies can apply the proposed Bayesian and MCMC method to estimating building ventilation rates and airborne aerosol infection risks based on actual measurement data such as CO2 levels with uncertainties and sensitivity of input parameters identified. The outdoor ventilation rate and CO2 threshold values as functions of exposure times could be used as the baseline models to develop correlations to be implemented by cheap/portable sensors to be applied in similar situations to monitor ventilation conditions and airborne risk levels.",Danlin Hou; Ali Katal; Liangzhu (Leon) Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250791,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250791,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
113,Towards a COVID-19 symptom triad: The importance of symptom constellations in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"Pandemic scenarios like SARS-Cov-2 require rapid information aggregation. In the age of eHealth and data-driven medicine, publicly available symptom tracking tools offer efficient and scalable means of collecting and analyzing large amounts of data. As a result, information gains can be communicated to front-line providers. We have developed such an application in less than a month and reached more than 500 thousand users within 48 hours. The dataset contains information on basic epidemiological parameters, symptoms, risk factors and details on previous exposure to a COVID-19 patient. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed different symptoms reported by users with confirmed contacts vs. no confirmed contacts. The symptom combination of anosmia, cough and fatigue was the most important feature to differentiate the groups, while single symptoms such as anosmia, cough or fatigue alone were not sufficient. A linear regression model from the literature using the same symptom combination as features was applied on all data. Predictions matched the regional distribution of confirmed cases closely across Germany, while also indicating that the number of cases in northern federal states might be higher than officially reported. In conclusion, we report that symptom combinations anosmia, fatigue and cough are most likely to indicate an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Leander Edwin Melms; Evelyn Falk; Bernhard Schieffer; Andreas Jerrentrup; Uwe Wagner; Sami Matrood; Jürgen R Schaefer; Tobias Müller; Martin Hirsch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250537,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250537,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
114,Optimal time to return to normality: parallel use of COVID-19 vaccines and circuit breakers,"By January 2020, the COVID-19 illness has caused over two million deaths. Countries have restricted disease spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing). More severe ""lockdowns"" have also been required. Although lockdowns keep people safer from the virus, they substantially disrupt economies and individual well-being. Fortunately, vaccines are becoming available. Yet, vaccination programs may take several months to implement, requiring further time for individuals to develop immunity following inoculation. To prevent health services being overwhelmed it may be necessary to implement further lockdowns in conjunction with vaccination. Here, we investigate optimal approaches for vaccination under varying lockdown lengths and/or severities to prevent COVID-19-related deaths exceeding critical thresholds. We find increases in vaccination rate cause a disproportionately larger decrease in lockdowns: with vaccination, severe lockdowns can reduce infections by up to 89%. Notably, we include demographics, modelling three groups: vulnerable, front-line workers, and non-vulnerable. We investigate the sequence of vaccination. One counter-intuitive finding is that even though the vulnerable group is high risk, demographically, this is a small group (per person, vaccination occurs more slowly) so vaccinating this group first achieves limited gains in overall disease control. Better disease control occurs by vaccinating the non-vulnerable group with longer and/or more severe lockdowns.",Michael Bonsall; Chris Huntingford; Thomas Rawson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250877,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250877,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
115,RAY: CRISPR diagnostic for rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV2 variants on a paper strip,"The COVID-19 pandemic originating in the Wuhan province of China in late 2019 has impacted global health, causing increased mortality among elderly patients and individuals with comorbid conditions. During the passage of the virus through affected populations, it has undergone mutations- some of which have recently been linked with increased viral load and prognostic complexities. Interestingly, several of these variants are point mutations that are difficult to diagnose using the gold standard quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method. This necessitates widespread sequencing which is expensive, has long turn-around times, and requires high viral load for calling mutations accurately. In this study, we show that the high specificity of Francisella novicida Cas9 (FnCas9) to point mismatches can be successfully adapted for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV2 infection as well as for detecting point mutations in the sequence of the virus obtained from patient samples. We report the detection of the mutation N501Y (earlier shown to be present in the British N501Y.V1, South African N501Y.V2, and Brazilian N501Y.V3 variants of SARS-CoV2) within an hour using paper strip chemistry. The results were corroborated using deep sequencing.

116,Antibody seroprevalence and rate of asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Austrian hospital personnel.,"ContextOn March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of infection followed an exponential increase until a complete lockdown in March 2020. Thereafter easing of restrictions was gradually introduced and until mid-August daily infections remained mostly below 5 per 100.000 population.

ObjectivesThe aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM, and/or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) during the study, iii) the antibody decline in seropositive subjects over a period of around six months, and iv) the utility of rapid antibody tests for outpatient screening.

Study DesignOpen uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study.

Setting/ParticipantsA total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in the study.

Study Interventions and MeasuresRapid antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies, and RT-PCR tests based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA/PRNT were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4{+/-}7.7 (Min=30, Max=64) days. Additionally, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities. Antibody positive tested participants were re-tested with ELISA/PRNT tests at a third time point on average 188.0{+/-}12.8 days after their initial test.

ResultsIn our study cohort, only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.81%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among participants who had positive test results in either of the antibody tests, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding six weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%).

The rapid antibody test was generally more sensitive based on serum (sensitivity=86.6%) as compared to whole blood (sensitivity=65.4). Concerning both ELISA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity=88.9%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity=81.5%).

In participants with a positive PRNT, a significant decrease in PRNT concentration from 31.8{+/-}22.9 (Md=32.0) at T1 to 26.1{+/-}17.6 (Md=21.3) at T2 to 21.4{+/-}13.4 (Md=16.0) at T3 ({chi}2=23.848, df=2, p<0.001) was observed ({chi}2=23.848, df=2, p<0.001) - with an average time of 42.4{+/-}7.7 days between T1 and T2 and 146.9{+/-}13.8 days between T2 and T3.

ConclusionsDuring the study period (May 11th - December 21th) only 0.81% were tested positive for antibodies in our study cohort.

Data sourcesarticles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and medRxiv up to November 16, 2020, one year after the first publicly known confirmed COVID-19 case.

Eligibility criteria and data analysisany COVID-19 and mental disorders relevant English studies with frontline/general healthcare workers, general adult population sample, using validated scales. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, distress, general psychological symptoms (GPS), insomnia, and PTSD and ran meta-regression to tease out the heterogeneity.

ResultsThe meta-analysis includes 131 studies and 171 independent samples. The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, GPS, insomnia, and PTSD are 11%, 13%, 20%, 13%, 19%, and 20%, respectively. The meta-regression results uncovered several predictors of the prevalence rates, including severity (e.g., above severe vs. above moderate, p<0.01; above moderate vs. above mild, p<0.01) and type of mental issues (e.g., depression vs. anxiety, p=0.04; insomnia vs. anxiety p=0.04), population (frontline HCWs vs. general HCWs, p<0.01), sampling location (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan, p=0.04), and study quality (p=0.04).

LimitationsFirst, we only focus on China population, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Second, 96.2% studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional. Last, since we only included studies published in English, we expect to have a language bias.

ConclusionOur pooled prevalence rates are significantly different from, yet largely between, the findings of previous meta-analyses, suggesting the results of our larger study are consistent with, yet fine-tune, the findings of the smaller, previous meta-analyses. Hence, this meta-analysis not only provides a significant update on the mental health prevalence rates in COVID-19 but also suggests the need to update meta-analyses continuously to provide more accurate estimates of the prevalence of mental illness during this ongoing health crisis. While prior meta-analyses focused on the prevalence rates of mental health disorders based on one level of severity (i.e., above mild), our findings also suggest a need to examine the prevalence rates at varying levels of severity. The one-year cumulative evidence on sampling locations (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan) corroborates the typhoon eye effect theory. Our finding that the prevalence rates of distress and insomnia and those of frontline healthcare workers are higher suggest future research and interventions should pay more attention to those mental outcomes and populations.

118,How lifestyle changes within the COVID-19 global pandemic have affected the pattern and symptoms of the menstrual cycle.,"BackgroundThe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant changes to homes, working life and stress. The purpose of this research was to investigate the implications that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the menstrual cycle and any contributing factors to these changes.

MethodsA questionnaire was completed by 749 participants, whom ranged from  physically active to elite, in their training status. The questionnaire captured detail on menstrual cycle symptoms and characteristics prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, as well as lifestyle, stress, exercise and nutrition. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribution were reported and decision tree analysis performed. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05.

ResultsFifty-two point six percent of females experienced a change in their menstrual cycle during the lockdown period. Psychosocial symptoms had changed in over half of all participants. Participants who reported increased stress/worry in family and personal health were significantly associated with changes in menstrual symptoms. Similarly, job security stress was associated with increases in bleeding time (p<0.05).

ConclusionsIt is important that females and practitioners become aware of the implications of stressful environments and the possible long-term implications on fertility, particularly given the uncertainty around a second wave of the global pandemic.",Georgie Bruinvels; Esther Goldsmith; Richard Blagrove; Dan Martin; Laurence Shaw; Jessica Piasecki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250919,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250919,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
119,"The effect of mobility restrictions on the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave: what are the impacts in Sweden, USA, France and Colombia.","ResumeCombined with sanitation and social distancing measures, control of human mobility has quickly been targeted as a major leverage to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a great majority of countries worldwide. The extent to which such measures were successful, however, is uncertain (Gibbs et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020). Very few studies are quantifying the relation between mobility, lockdown strategies and the diffusion of the virus in different countries. Using the anonymised data collected by one of the major social media platforms (Facebook) combined with spatial and temporal Covid-19 data, the objective of this research is to understand how mobility patterns and SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave are connected in four different countries: the west coast of the USA, Colombia, Sweden and France. Our analyses suggest a relatively modest impact of lockdown on the spread of the virus at the national scale. Despite a varying impact of lockdown on mobility reduction in these countries (83% in France and Colombia, 55% in USA, 10% in Sweden), no country successfully implemented control measures to stem the spread of the virus. As observed in Hubei (Chinazzi et al. 2020), it is likely that the virus had already spread very widely prior to lockdown; the number of affected administrative units in all countries was already very high at the time of lockdown despite the low testing levels. The second conclusion is that the integration of mobility data considerably improved the epidemiological model (as revealed by the QAIC). If inter-individual contact is a fundamental element in the study of the spread of infectious diseases, it is also the case at the level of administrative units. However, this relational dimension is little understood beyond the individual scale mostly due to the lack of mobility data at this scale. Fortunately, these types of data are getting increasingly provided by social media or mobile operators, and they can be used to help administrations to observe changes in movement patterns and/or to better locate where to implement disease control measures such as vaccination (Pollina & Busvine 2020; Pullano et al. 2020; Romm et al. 2020).",Olivier Telle; Samuel Benkimoun; Richard E.

120,"ABC2-SPH risk score for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients: development, external validation and comparison with other available scores","ObjectiveTo develop and validate a rapid scoring system at hospital admission for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and to compare this score with other existing ones.

DesignCohort study

SettingThe Brazilian COVID-19 Registry has been conducted in 36 Brazilian hospitals in 17 cities. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a prediction model for in-hospital mortality, based on the 3978 patients that were admitted between March-July, 2020. The model was then validated in the 1054 patients admitted during August-September, as well as in an external cohort of 474 Spanish patients.

ParticipantsConsecutive symptomatic patients ([&ge;]18 years old) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted to participating hospitals. Patients who were transferred between hospitals and in whom admission data from the first hospital or the last hospital were not available were excluded, as well those who were admitted for other reasons and developed COVID-19 symptoms during their stay.

Main outcome measuresIn-hospital mortality

ResultsMedian (25th-75th percentile) age of the model-derivation cohort was 60 (48-72) years, 53.8% were men, in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. The validation cohorts had similar age distribution and in-hospital mortality. From 20 potential predictors, seven significant variables were included in the in-hospital mortality risk score: age, blood urea nitrogen, number of comorbidities, C-reactive protein, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count and heart rate. The model had high discriminatory value (AUROC 0.844, 95% CI 0.829 to 0.859), which was confirmed in the Brazilian (0.859) and Spanish (0.899) validation cohorts. Our ABC2-SPH score showed good calibration in both Brazilian cohorts, but, in the Spanish cohort, mortality was somewhat underestimated in patients with very high (>25%) risk. The ABC2-SPH score is implemented in a freely available online risk calculator (https://abc2sph.com/).

ConclusionsWe designed and validated an easy-to-use rapid scoring system based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients commonly available at hospital presentation, for early stratification for in-hospital mortality risk of patients with COVID-19.

121,A Rapid Realist Review of the Role of Community Pharmacy in the Public Health Response to COVID-19,"IntroductionCommunity pharmacists and their teams have remained accessible to the public providing essential services despite immense pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out.

AimThis rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future.

MethodAn embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data was extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics, and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations.

ResultsThe 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy.

DiscussionCommunity pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.",Ian D Maidment; Emma Young; Maura MacPhee; Andrew Booth; Hadar Zaman; Juanita Breen; Andrea Hilton; Tony Kelly; Geoff Wong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250765,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250765,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
122,Increased circulating levels of angiotensin-(1-7) in severely ill COVID-19 patients,"The mono-carboxypeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important ""player"" of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It has been hypothesized that following SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 internalization Ang II level would increase in parallel to a decrease of Ang-(1-7) in COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary report, we analyzed the plasma levels of angiotensin peptides in 19 severe COVID-19 patients and 19 non-COVID-19 volunteers, to assess potential outcome associations. Unexpectedly, a significant increase in circulating Ang-(1-7) and lower Ang II plasma level were found in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, an increased Ang-(1-7)/ Ang II ratio was observed in COVID-19 suggesting a RAS dysregulation toward an increased formation of Ang-(1-7) in these patients.",Ana Luisa Valle Martins; Filipe Alex Silva; Lucas Bolais Ramos; Renata Cunha Ribeiro; Filippo Annoni; Alexandre Cardoso; Gisele Capanema Oliveira; Juliana Carvalho Martins; Daisy Motta Santos; Bruna Zivianni; Maria Jose Campagnole-Santos; Danilo Augusto Alves Pereira; Fabio Silvio Taccone; Thiago Verano Braga; Robson A S Santos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.20232785,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.20232785,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
123,Estimating the effectiveness of the Pfizer COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine after a single dose. A reanalysis of a study of 'real-world' vaccination outcomes from Israel.,"A distinctive feature of the roll out of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the UK was the decision to delay the timing of the second injection till 12 weeks after the first. The logic behind this is to protect more people sooner and so reduce the total number of severe infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. This decision caused criticism from some quarters due in part to a belief that a single injection may not give adequate immunity. A recent paper based on Israels experience of vaccination suggested that a single dose may not provide adequate protection. Here we extract the primary data from the Israeli paper and then estimate the incidence per day for each day after the first injection and also estimate vaccine effectiveness for each day from day 13 to day 24. We used a pooled estimate of the daily incidence rate during days 1 to 12 as the counterfactual estimate of incidence without disease and estimated confidence intervals using Monte Carlo modelling. After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off. The cause of the initial surge in infection risk is unknown but may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection. What our analysis shows is that a single dose of vaccine is highly protective, although it can take up to 21 days to achieve this. The early results coming from Israel support the UK policy of extending the gap between doses by showing that a single dose can give a high level of protection.",Paul R Hunter; Julii Suzanne Brainard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250957,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250957,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
124,COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters before and after pub lockdown,"AimTo study how different bans on serving alcohol in Norwegian bars and restaurants were related to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in bartenders and waiters.

MethodsIn 24,276 bartenders and waiters and 1,287,970 persons with other occupations (mean [SD] age 41.7 [12.8] years and 51.7% men), we examined the weekly rates of workers tested and detected with SARS-CoV-2, one to five weeks before and one to five weeks after implementation of different degrees of bans on serving alcohol in pubs and restaurants, across 56 Norwegian municipalities with: 1) full blanket ban, 2) partial ban with hourly restrictions (e.g. from 10 pm), or 3) no ban, adjusted for age, sex and testing behavior.

ResultsIn municipalities introducing full ban, COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters had been reduced by 65% by three weeks (from 3.4 [95%CI=2.5-4.3] to 1.2 [95%CI=0.7-1.7] per 1000), i.e. to the same levels as that for persons with other occupations (1.8 [95%CI=1.7-1.9] vs 1.2 [95%CI=1.1-1.3] per 1000). Similarly, in municipalities introducing partial ban, COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters had been reduced by 68% by three weeks (from 2.5 [95%CI=1.4-3.6] to 0.8 [95%CI=0.0-1.5] per 1000). However, there was more uncertainty to the estimated reduction for partial bans.

ConclusionMunicipalities with higher levels of confirmed COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters implemented stricter bans on serving of alcohol than other municipalities.

125,"Sarilumab treatment of hospitalised patients with severe or critical COVID-19: a multinational, randomised, adaptive, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BackgroundElevated proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity. We assessed efficacy and safety of sarilumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in severe (requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal canula or face mask) or critical (requiring greater supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal support) COVID-19.

MethodsThis was a 60-day, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial in patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pneumonia, who required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Patients were randomised 2:2:1 to intravenous sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to [&ge;]2-point clinical improvement (7-point scale; range: 1 [death] to 7 [not hospitalised]). The key secondary endpoint was proportion of patients alive at day 29. Safety outcomes included adverse events and laboratory assessments. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04327388).

FindingsBetween March 28 and July 3, 2020, 420 patients were randomised; 416 received treatment (placebo, n=84; sarilumab 200 mg, n=159; sarilumab 400 mg, n=173). At day 29, there were no significant differences in median (95% CI) time to [&ge;]2-point improvement between placebo (12{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-15{middle dot}0] days) and sarilumab groups (200 mg: 10{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-12{middle dot}0] days, p=0.96, log-rank test; 400 mg: 10{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-13{middle dot}0] days, p=0.34) or in proportions of patients alive (placebo, 91{middle dot}7%; sarilumab 200 mg, 89{middle dot}9%, p=0{middle dot}63; sarilumab 400 mg, 91{middle dot}9%, p=0{middle dot}85). At day 29, there were numerical, nonsignificant survival differences between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +9%, 95% CI -7{middle dot}7 to 25{middle dot}5, p=0{middle dot}25) for critical patients. There were no unexpected safety signals.

InterpretationThis trial did not demonstrate efficacy of sarilumab in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and receiving supplemental oxygen. Adequately powered trials of targeted immunomodulatory therapies assessing survival as a primary endpoint are suggested in patients with critical COVID-19.

126,Sex disparities and neutralizing antibody durability to SARS-CoV-2 infection in convalescent individuals,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now caused over 2 million deaths worldwide and continues to expand. Currently, much is unknown about functionally neutralizing human antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2. Using convalescent sera collected from 101 COVID-19 recovered individuals 21-212 days after symptom onset with forty-eight additional longitudinal samples, we measured functionality and durability of serum antibodies. We also evaluated associations between individual demographic and clinical parameters with functional neutralizing antibody responses to COVID-19. We found robust antibody durability out to six months, as well as significant positive associations with the magnitude of the neutralizing antibody response and male sex. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent neutralizing antibodies are higher in individuals with cardio-metabolic comorbidities.

SignificanceIn this study we found that neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19 convalescent individuals vary in magnitude but are durable and correlate well with RBD Ig binding antibody levels compared to other SARS-CoV-2 antigen responses. In our cohort, higher neutralizing antibody titers are independently and significantly associated with male sex compared to female sex. We also show for the first time, that higher convalescent antibody titers in male donors are associated with increased age and symptom grade. Furthermore, cardio-metabolic co-morbidities are associated with higher antibody titers independently of sex. Here, we present an in-depth evaluation of serologic, demographic, and clinical correlates of functional antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2.",Alena Janda Markmann; Natasa Gaillourou; D.

127,Vaccinating Australia: How long will it take?,"The Australian Governments COVID-19 vaccine rollout strategy is scheduled to commence in late February 2021 and aims to vaccinate the Australian adult population by the end of October 2021. The task of vaccinating some 20 million people within this timeframe presents considerable logistical challenges. Key to meeting this target is the rate of vaccine delivery: the number of vaccine doses that can be administered per day. In the opening phase, high priority groups will receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through hospital hubs at an initial rate of 80,000 doses per week. However, pending regulatory approval, the currently announced plan appears to be to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine to the bulk of the popluation through a combination of general practices and community pharmacies. Here, we run a series of projections to estimate how long it will take to vaccinate the Australian population under different assumptions about the rate of vaccine administration as well as the schedule for second doses and prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis highlights the ambitious rate of vaccine administration that will be neccessary to meet the Australian Government completion target of October 2021. A rate of 200,000 doses per day would comfortably meet that target; 80,000 doses a day would see roll-out extended until mid-2022. Speed is of the essence when it comes to vaccine rollout: protecting the population quickly will minimise the risk of sporadic and costly lockdowns lockdowns and the potential for small, local clusters getting out of control and sparking new epidemic waves. The government should gather all its resources to maximise the daily vaccination rate, ideally aiming to ramp up administration to at least 200,000 doses per day as quickly as possible. Quickly achieving and maintaining this pace will likely require dedicated large-scale vaccination sites that are capable of delivering thousands of doses a week in addition to the enthusiastic participation of GP practices and community pharmacies around the country. Lessons on the neccessary logistical planning, including coordination of delivery, ultra-cold-chain storage and staffing, can potentially be learned from Israel, where between 7,000 and 20,000 vaccinations per million population have been delivered daily throughout January.",Mark J Hanly; Tim Churches; Oisin Fitzgerald; Chandini Raina MacIntyre; Louisa Jorm,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250979,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250979,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
128,Increased hazard of death in community-tested cases of SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01,"VOC 202012/01, a SARS-CoV-2 variant first detected in the United Kingdom in September 2020, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that this novel variant is more transmissible than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2, but have not identified whether the new variant leads to any change in disease severity. We analyse a large database of SARS-CoV-2 community test results and COVID-19 deaths for England, representing approximately 47% of all SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 7% of COVID-19 deaths in England from 1 September 2020 to 22 January 2021. Fortuitously, these SARS-CoV-2 tests can identify VOC 202012/01 because mutations in this lineage prevent PCR amplification of the spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF). We estimate that the hazard of death among SGTF cases is 30% (95% CI 9-56%) higher than among non-SGTF cases after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation level, care home residence, local authority of residence and date of test. In absolute terms, this increased hazard of death corresponds to the risk of death for a male aged 55-69 increasing from 0.56% to 0.73% (95% CI 0.60-0.86%) over the 28 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF, we estimate a 35% (12-64%) higher hazard of death associated with VOC 202012/01.

129,Epidemiological and evolutionary considerations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dosing regimes,"As the threat of Covid-19 continues and in the face of vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels. How timing of delivery of the second dose affects infection burden but also prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape are critical questions. Both hinge on the strength and duration (i.e. robustness) of the immune response elicited by a single dose, compared to natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short-term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection, evaluating how different second dose delays might drive immune escape via a build-up of partially immune individuals. Under certain scenarios, we find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose, and to ramp up vaccination efforts throughout the world.",Chadi M. Saad-Roy; Sinead E.

130,Changes in Characteristics of Opioid Overdose Death Trends during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background and AimsThere are limited reports analyzing opioid overdose (OD) mortality data during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also great heterogeneity in outcomes across states, necessitating assessments of the effects of COVID-19 on OD deaths on a state-by-state level. This report aims to analyze overall trends in OD deaths in Massachusetts during COVID-19.

DesignUsing individual-level death records in Massachusetts, we identified and analyzed OD mortality trends during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 2018 and 2019. We analyzed the period between March 24 (stay-at-home order in 2020) and August 11 (latest reliable data). We also estimated the correlation between OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates at the county level.

SettingMassachusetts.

ParticipantsA total of 2,342 OD deaths were analyzed.

MeasurementsThe outcomes studied were OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates.

FindingsOD deaths involving cocaine and amphetamines increased from 2019 to 2020, by 20% (276 vs. 330; P<0.01) and 79% (33 vs. 59; P<0.01), respectively, but were steady from 2018 to 2019. Heroins presence continued to decrease (238 in 2018, 161 in 2019, 102 in 2020; P<0.001); however, fentanyl was present in more than 90% of OD deaths, reflecting its continued domination of the illicit opioid supply in Massachusetts. Prescription opioid presence was stable. 79% of OD decedents were White and 6% were Black in 2019, as compared to 74% and 10% in 2020 (P=0.01). We found no significant correlation between COVID-19 case fatality and OD death rates.

ConclusionsIncreased deaths involving stimulants and alcohol reflect concerning trends in the era of COVID-19. Rising OD death rates among Black residents underscore that interventions focused on racial equity are necessary. Surveillance efforts must utilize up-to-date data to measure COVID-19 impacts on OD death and respond to imminent threats in real time.",Catherine DiGennaro; Gian-Gabriel Garcia; Erin Stringfellow; Sarah Wakeman; Mohammad S.

131,Microscopic dynamics modeling unravels the role of asymptomatic virus carriers in SARS-CoV-2 epidemics at the interplay between biological and social factors,"The recent experience of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics spreading revealed the importance of passive forms of infection transmissions. Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modelling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and to unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes. The model accounts for each human actors susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.",Bosiljka Tadic; Roderick Melnik,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250926,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250926,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
132,Multi-modality detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal donor samples for transplantation and in asymptomatic emergency surgical admissions,"IntroductionFaecal transplantation is an evidence based treatment for Clostridiodes difficile. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to shed the virus in stool for up to 33 days, well beyond the average clearance time for upper respiratory tract shedding. We carried out an analytical and clinical validation of reverse-transcriptase quantitative (RT-qPCR) as well as LAMP, LamPORE and droplet digital PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool from donated samples for FMT, spiked samples and asymptomatic inpatients in an acute surgical unit.

MethodsKilled SARS-CoV-2 viral lysate and extracted RNA was spiked into donor stool & FMT and a linear dilution series from 10-1 to 10-5 and tested via RT-qPCR, LAMP, LamPORE and ddPCR against SARS-CoV-2. Patients admitted to the critical care unit with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and sequential asymptomatic patients from acute presentation to an acute surgical unit were also tested.

ResultsIn a linear dilution series, detection of the lowest dilution series was found to be 8 copies per microlitre of sample. Spiked lysate samples down to 10-2 dilution were detected in FMT samples using RTQPCR, LamPORE and ddPCR and down to 10-1 with LAMP. In symptomatic patients 5/12 had detectable SARS-CoV-2 in stool via RT-qPCR and 6/12 via LamPORE, and in 1/97 asymptomatic patients via RT-qPCR.

ConclusionsRT-qPCR can be detected in FMT donor samples using RT-qPCR, LamPORE and ddPCR to low levels using validated pathways.

133,SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the healthcare setting into the home: a prospective longitudinal cohort study,"ObjectiveTo assess the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in healthcare workers and subsequent transmission to their close contacts within their household. To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in exposed participants.

SettingTwo acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of England.

BackgroundThe UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current literature.

MethodsHealthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs.

Results633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%).

7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50[&ge;]1/300; no cohabitee achieved this level..

ConclusionsTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce viral transmission from hospitals to the community.

SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSSection 1: What is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIHealthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population due, at least in part, to high levels of occupational exposure.
C_LIO_LIIgA, IgM and IgG are detectable for most patients after 11 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection but all decline in the weeks following SAR-CoV-2 exposure.
C_LIO_LIRates of transmission to healthcare workers, and therefore subsequent transmission to their close contacts, may be reduced with effective PPE.

Section 2: What this study addsO_LIThe amount of neutralising antibodies formed may be dependent on IgG response as it is much lower among seropositive cohabitees than seropositive healthcare workers.
C_LIO_LINHS Healthcare workers had a far greater seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LICohabitees of positive healthcare workers have a 6-fold increased risk of developing serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LIDespite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community.

Research into contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for articles published between January 1 2020 and January 27, 2021 with the terms ""Covid-19"", ""healthcare workers"", and ""transmission"" ""home {NOT nursing} or household"". We did not restrict our search by language or type of publication. We identified 38 studies of which only one assessed the prevalence among HCW households using Canadian national databases. Our PubMed search yielded only one serological study within the German Healthcare system, which suggested very low transmission from healthcare workers to their close cohabitees.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal serological cohort study assessing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the UK healthcare environment to the home (n = 633 healthcare workers, 178 cohabitees). Our findings showed that serological evidence within the HCW was high with 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. A cohabitee of a seropositive HCW had a six-fold increase of being seropositive themselves compared to a baseline rate of 2.5%. Despite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

Implications of all available evidenceUnderstanding the transmission during the first wave from the healthcare setting into the home and the extent of such transmissions is essential to understand containment strategies of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants or to understand viral transmission of future respiratory viruses. NHS workers appeared to be at an increased risk of contracting of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the HCWs of other nations; we hypothesise that this may be related to a scarcity of appropriate personal protective equipment during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population. An infected HCW, whether symptomatic or not, appears to be a significant bridge for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to their close home contacts.",Simon Craxford; Jessica Nightingale; Adeel Ikram; Ben Arthur Marson; Anthony Kelly; Alan Norrish; Amrita Vijay; Stuart Astbury; Lola Cusin; Waheed Ashraf; Jayne Newham; Guruprasad Aithal; Patrick Tighe; Jonathan Ball; Alexander W Tarr; Richard A Urbanowicz; Ana Valdes; Benjamin Ollivere,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250950,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250950,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

The proposed multi-compartment model is expressed through a system of difference equations that describe their temporal dynamics. Various compartments in our model is connected to the social distancing measures and diagnostic testing rates. A nonparametric estimation strategy is employed for obtaining estimates of interpretable temporally static and dynamic epidemiological rate parameters. The confidence bands of the parameters are obtained using a residual bootstrap procedure. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to estimate latent compartments such as the trajectory of the number of asymptomatic but infected individuals which are the key vectors of COVID-19 spread.

135,"Evaluation of Depression, Anxiety and Sleep Quality in the Brazilian Population During Social Isolation Due to the New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: the DEGAS-CoV Study","IntroductionThe new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has caused distress and repercussions in mental and physical health of individuals. Depression, anxiety and worsening of sleep quality have been reported in several recent articles that surveyed populations all over the globe. Our work meant to access, through a cross-sectional study, these disorders in the Brazilian population, through the application of an online questionnaire conducted on the second trimester of 2020.

Materials and MethodsWe applied an online questionnaire, filled with questions regarding social, economic, financial, educational and health status, as well as questions from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), and from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

ResultsWe collected 2,695 valid answers, from April 24th to May 31st, 2020. Age ranged from 18 to 79 years, mean of 31.3. Women were 76.3%, men 23.7%. Symptoms of Anxiety were found in 56.5%, of depression in 46.1%, and of bad sleep in 49.2%. Some groups were more prone than others to one or more of those conditions, such as: younger people, women, mestizos, Northeasterners, people with lesser years of education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic, caregivers, students, sedentary or people practicing less physical activity, people who followed more hours of news of COVID-19 and those less engaged in social and instrumental activities.

Conclusionanxiety, depression and bad sleep quality were significantly high in our survey. Mental and sleep health is heterogeneously affected among individuals, depending on social, economic, financial, educational and health status.

O_TEXTBOXHIGHLIGHTS

- An online survey (DEGAS-CoV) was conducted between April 30th and May 31st, 2020, with people living in Brazil, aged 18 or more. The study obtained 2,695 valid answers.
- Rates of possible anxiety, possible depression and bad sleep quality were 56.5%, 46.1% and 49.2%, respectively. Rates are similar to another Brazilian survey, with 45,161 participants, conducted in a similar time window.
- Were more prone to mental and/or sleep conditions: younger participants, women, mestizos, unemployed, students, people with less years of education, people with lower income or with considerable drops of income during the virus outbreak, caregivers, people who followed more news of COVID-19, people less engaged in social and instrumental activities, smokers, sedentary or those who practiced less physical activity, and people who had symptoms suspected (confirmed or not) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Alcohol drinkers were slightly less likely to be possibly depressed. That finding needs more clarification and may be due to confounders.

136,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and associated outcomes: results from an ongoing prospective cohort study, New York City","BackgroundIn May-July 2020 in the New York City area, up to 16% of pregnant women had reportedly been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies found associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and certain adverse outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, cesarean delivery). These studies relied on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection. This led to overrepresentation of symptomatic or acutely ill cases in scientific studies.

ObjectiveTo expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology and stage of infection, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels.

Study DesignThe Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant women receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai West Hospital from April 20, 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before August 15, 2020. Blood was drawn as part of routine clinical care; for each woman, we tested the latest sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labor and delivery. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, Apgar score, ICU/NICU admission, and neonatal hospital length of stay) and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Among all Generation C participants who had given birth by August 15, 2020 (n=708), we established the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Excluding women who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models to compare antibody positive women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery with antibody negative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification.

ResultsThe SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4% (n=116, 95% CI 13.7-19.3). Twelve women (1.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery (11 of these women were seropositive). Seropositive women were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative women. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity without RT-PCR positivity at delivery was associated with decreased odds of caesarean delivery (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.27; 0.84) compared with seronegative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. Stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between seropositivity and decreased odds of caesarean delivery remained for non-Hispanic Black/African-American and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic White women. No other pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity.

ConclusionSeropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery, suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy, was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample of women from New York City. While non-Hispanic Black and Latina women in our cohort had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared with non-Hispanic White women, we found no increase in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among these groups due to infection.",Nina M Molenaar; Anna-Sophie Rommel; Lotje de Witte; Siobhan Dolan; Whitney Lieb; Erona Ibroci; Sophie Ohrn; Jezelle Lynch; Christina Capuano; Daniel Stadlbauer; Florian Krammer; Lauren Zapata; Rachel Brody; Rhoda Sperling; Omara Afzal; Roy Missall; Amy Balbierz; Teresa Janevic; Joanne Stone; Elizabeth Howell; Veerle Bergink,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250943,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
137,"Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 on college campuses: Initial efforts, lessons learned and research needs","BackgroundWastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging approach to help identify the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. This tool can contribute to public health surveillance at both community (wastewater treatment system) and institutional (e.g., colleges, prisons, nursing homes) scales.

ObjectivesThis research aims to understand the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from initial wastewater surveillance efforts at colleges and university systems to inform future research, development and implementation.

MethodsThis paper presents the experiences of 25 college and university systems in the United States that monitored campus wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 during the fall 2020 academic period. We describe the broad range of approaches, findings, resource needs, and lessons learned from these initial efforts. These institutions range in size, social and political geographies, and include both public and private institutions.

DiscussionOur analysis suggests that wastewater monitoring at colleges requires consideration of information needs, local sewage infrastructure, resources for sampling and analysis, college and community dynamics, approaches to interpretation and communication of results, and follow-up actions. Most colleges reported that a learning process of experimentation, evaluation, and adaptation was key to progress. This process requires ongoing collaboration among diverse stakeholders including decision-makers, researchers, faculty, facilities staff, students, and community members.",Sasha Harris-Lovett; Kara L Nelson; Paloma Beamer; Heather N Bischel; Aaron Bivins; Andrea Bruder; Caitlyn Butler; Todd D.

ObjectiveTo identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding and antibody response in farmworkers in California.

DesignThis cross-sectional study collected survey data and determined current SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seropositivity among 1,107 farmworkers in Californias Salinas Valley from 16 July to 30 November 2020.

SettingFarmworkers receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites were invited to participate in our study.

ParticipantsIndividuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, [&ge;]18 years old, had conducted farm work since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish.

ExposuresSociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Current (as indicated by TMA positivity) and historical (as indicated by IgG seropositivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsMost farmworkers enrolled in the study were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels of educational attainment, and were overweight or obese. Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.99-1.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60; 1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24). Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection.

139,"Scientists' opinion, attitudes, and consensus towards immunity passports","ObjectivesWe measured attitudes towards ""immunity passports"" in the context of COVID-19 of a large sample of scientists. Consensus of scientists opinions on a different aspect of immunity passports was assessed.

MethodsWe designed and implemented a survey to capture what scientists from around the world and different scientific background think about immunity certification. The survey was sent to the corresponding authors of scholarly articles published in the last five years in the top 20-ranked journals in each of the 27 subject areas between May and June 2020. Responses from 12,738 scientists were captured, and their distribution was tabulated by participants in health science and other fields. Consensus of responses was calculated using a variant of Shannon Entropy, made suitable for the ordinal response variables.

ResultsHalf of the scientists surveyed, regardless of academic background agree that a potential immunity passport program will be good for public health (50.2%) and the economy (54.4%), with 19.1% and 15.4% of participants disagree, respectively. A significant proportion of scientists raised concerns about immunity certification over fairness to others (36.5%) and social inequality (45.5%). There is little consensus in the different aspects of immunity passport among scientists. Overall, scientists with health background hold a more conservative view towards immunity certification.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest a lack of general agreement regarding the potential health and economic benefits, societal costs, and ethical issues of an immunity certification program within the scientific community. Given the relevant and important implications of immunity passport due to the increasing vaccine availability and efficacy, more attention should be given to the discussion of the design and implementation of immunity certification program.

140,Timing of Convalescent plasma administration and 28-day mortality for COVID-19 pneumonia.,"Convalescent plasma administration (CPA) is widely used to treat Covid-19, but its effectiveness remains controversial. Here we report the results of an Expanded Access Program of CPA in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. We evaluated the relationship between the timing of CPA and 28-day mortality in 4719 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Early ([&le;]3 days from admission) CPA was associated to decreased mortality in patients in the general ward and in the Intensive Care Unit not requiring mechanical ventilation. This suggests that the favorable effect of CPA might be related both to disease acuity and to the therapeutic window.",Soledad Estrella Gonzalez; Lorena Regairaz; Martin Salazar; Noelia Ferrando; Veronica Gonzalez; Patricia Carrera Ramos; Santiago Pesci; Juan Manuel Vidal; Nicolas Kreplak; Elisa Estenssoro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250758,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250758,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
141,SEVERE COVID-19 IS MARKED BY DYSREGULATED SERUM LEVELS OF CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A3 AND SEROTONIN,"The immune response plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from protection to tissue damage. This is observed in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome when elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines are detected. Several cells of the immune response are implied in this dysregulated immune response including innate immune cells and T and B cell lymphocytes. Mast cells are abundant resident cells of the respiratory tract, able to rapidly release different inflammatory mediators following stimulation. Recently, mast cells have been associated with tissue damage during viral infections, but little is known about their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We noticed that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3), and decreased serotonin levels in their serum. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, while serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that mast cells are relevant players in the inflammatory response in COVID-19, might represent targets for therapeutic intervention.",Rodolfo Soria-Castro; Yatsiri G.

142,Colchicine use in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionColchicine may inhibit inflammasome signaling and reduce proinflammatory cytokines, a purported mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to report on the state of the current literature on the use of colchicine in COVID-19 and to investigate the reported clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients by colchicine usage.

MethodsThe literature was searched from January 2019 through January 28, 2021. References were screened to identify studies that reported the effect of colchicine usage on COVID-19 outcomes including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, or mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroup of trial design (RCT vs observational) and ICU status. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsSix studies, reporting on 5,033 patients, were included in this review. Across the six studies, COVID-19 patients who had colchicine had a lower risk of mortality - HR of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.66) and OR of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.76). Among the three observational studies, COVID-19 patients who received colchicine had a lower risk of mortality - HR of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.66) and OR of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.71). Among three randomized controlled trials, the summary point estimate suggests a direction toward benefit in mortality that is not statistically significant among patients receiving colchicine versus placebo- OR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.20, 1.24).

ConclusionColchicine may reduce the risk of mortality in individuals with COVID-19. Further prospective investigation is warranted to determine the efficacy of colchicine as treatment in COVID-19 patients in various care settings of the disease.",Leonard Chiu; Ronald Chow; Nicholas Chiu; Chun-Han Lo; Rahul Aggarwal; Jihui Lee; Young-Geun Choi; Henry Lam; Elizabeth Horn Prsic; Hyun Joon Shin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250960,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250960,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
143,Deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human pancreatic cells,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 46 million people worldwide and caused more than 1.2 million deaths. It is transmitted by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and affects the respiratory tract as well as extra-pulmonary systems, including the pancreas, that express the virus entry receptor, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Importantly, the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, the latter composed of ductal and acinar cells, express high levels of ACE2, which correlates to impaired functionality characterized as acute pancreatitis observed in some cases presenting with COVID-19. Since acute pancreatitis is already one of the most frequent gastrointestinal causes of hospitalization in the U.S. and the majority of studies investigating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas are clinical and observational, we utilized human iPSC technology to investigate the potential deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures containing endocrine and exocrine cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting iPSC-derived pancreatic cells, thus perturbing their normal molecular and cellular phenotypes. The infection increased a key inflammatory cytokine, CXCL12, known to be involved in pancreas dysfunction. Transcriptome analysis of infected pancreatic cultures confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the ribosomal machinery in these cells. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the pancreas is confirmed in post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients, which showed co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells and increased the expression of some pancreatic ductal stress response genes. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human iPSC-derived pancreatic cells with supporting evidence of presence of the virus in post-mortem pancreatic tissue of confirmed COVID-19 human cases. This novel model of iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures will open new avenues for the comprehension of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially establish a platform for endocrine and exocrine pancreas-specific antiviral drug screening.",Syairah Hanan Shaharuddin; Victoria L Wang; Roberta DeSouza Santos; Yizhou Wang; Harneet Jawanda; Yi Zhang; Wohaib Hasan; Gustavo L Garcia; Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami; Dhruv Sareen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250846,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250846,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
144,Elevated mucosal antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 are correlated with lower viral load and faster decrease in systemic COVID-19 symptoms,"Mucosal antibodies play a key role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but their role during primary infection is not well understood. We assessed mucosal antibody responses during primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 and examined their relationship with viral load and clinical symptoms. Elevated mucosal IgM was associated with lower viral load. RBD and viral spike protein-specific mucosal antibodies were correlated with decreases in systemic symptoms, while older age was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms. Up to 42% of household contacts developed SARS-CoV-2-specific mucosal antibodies, including children, indicating high transmission rates within households in which children might play an important role.",Janeri Fröberg; Joshua Gillard; Ria Philipsen; Kjerstin Lanke; Joyce Rust; Diana van Tuijl; Teun Bousema; Elles Simonetti; Christa van der Gaast-de Jongh; Mariska Bos; Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld; Berend Jan Bosch; Marrigje Nabuurs-Franssen; Nannet van der Geest-Blankert; Charlotte van Daal; Martijn A.

145,Rapid vaccination and early reactive partial lockdown will minimize deaths from emerging highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants,"The goals of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs are to maximally reduce cases and deaths, and to limit the amount of time required under lockdown. Using a mathematical model calibrated to data from King County Washington but generalizable across states, we simulated multiple scenarios with different vaccine efficacy profiles, vaccination rates, and case thresholds for triggering and relaxing partial lockdowns. We assumed that a contagious variant is currently present at low levels. In all scenarios, it rapidly becomes dominant by early summer. Low case thresholds for triggering partial lockdowns during current and future waves of infection strongly predict lower total numbers of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in 2021. However, in regions with relatively higher current seroprevalence, there is a predicted delay in onset of a subsequent surge in new variant infections. For all vaccine efficacy profiles, increasing vaccination rate lowers the total number of infections and deaths, as well as the total number of days under partial lockdown. Due to variable current estimates of emerging variant infectiousness, vaccine efficacy against these variants, vaccine refusal, and future adherence to masking and physical distancing, we project considerable uncertainty regarding the timing and intensity of subsequent waves of infection. Nevertheless, under all plausible scenarios, rapid vaccination and early implementation of partial lockdown are the two most critical variables to save the greatest number of lives.",Daniel B Reeves; Chloe Bracis; David A Swan; Mia Moore; Dobromir Dimitrov; Joshua T Schiffer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250985,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250985,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
146,Extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a strictly-Orthodox Jewish community in the UK,"BackgroundEthnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community.

MethodsWe performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres.

FindingsA total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres.

InterpretationIn this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSIn January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", seroprevalence, ""ethnic minority"", and ""Jewish"" with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups.

Added value of the studyWe report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults.

Implications of the available evidenceOur data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.",Katherine M Gaskell; Marina Johnson; Victoria Gould; Adam Hunt; Neil RH Stone; William Waites; Ben Kasstan; Tracey Chantler; Sham Lal; Chrissy h.

147,Effect of co-infection with parasites on severity of COVID-19,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a spectrum of clinical presentations. The effect of co-infection with parasites on the clinical features of COVID-19 is unknown.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled consecutive COVID-19 patients and screened them for intestinal parasitic infections. Patients were followed during hospitalization for clinical outcomes. Patients with parasitic co-infection were compared to those without parasitic co-infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed severe disease. Factors associated with the development of severe disease were determined by logistic regression.

ResultsA total of 515 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for intestinal parasites, of whom 267 (51.8%) were co-infected with one or more parasites. Parasitic co-infection correlated inversely with COVID-19 severity. Severe COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients without parasites [47/248 (19.0%, CI: 14.52-24.35)] than in those with parasites [21/267 (7.9%, CI: 5.17-11.79)]; p<0.0001. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who developed severe COVID-19 in the non-protozoa group [56/369 (15.2%, CI: 11.85-19.23)] as compared to the protozoa group [12/146 (8.2%, CI: 4.70-14.00)]; p=0.036. Significant higher proportion of the patients presented at baseline with severe COVID-19 in the helminth negative group [57/341 (16.7%, CI: 13.10 - 21.08)] than in the group with pre-existing helminth infection [11/174 (6.3%, CI: 3.51 - 11.11)]; p=0.001. In addition, after adjustment for age and presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.77); p=0.006], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21-0.98); p=0.044] as well as those with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17-0.80); p=0.011] had lower probability of developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite, protozoa or helminth co-infection.

ConclusionOur results suggest that co-infection with parasitic co-infection appears to be associated with reduced COVID-19 severity. The results suggest that parasite-driven immunomodulatory responses may mute hyperinflammation associated with severe COVID-19.",Teklay Gebrecherkos; Zekarias Gessesse; Yazezew Kebede; Atsbeha Gebreegzabher; Geremew Tassew; Mahmud Abdulkader; Hiluf Ebuy; Abraham Desta; Atakilti Hailu; Vanessa Harris; Tobias Rinke de Wit; Dawit Wolday,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250995,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250995,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
148,The role of the SwissCovid digital contact tracing app during the pandemic response: results for the Canton of Zurich,"ImportanceDigital proximity tracing (DPT) apps were released in several countries to help interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains in the population. However, the impact of DPT on pandemic mitigation still remains to be demonstrated.

ObjectiveTo estimate key populations and performance indicators along the DPT app notification cascade in a clearly defined regional (Canton of Zurich, using all of Switzerland as a comparison) and temporal context (September/October 2020).

DesignPublicly available administrative and research data, including key DPT performance indicators, SARS-CoV-2 testing statistics, infoline call statistics, and observational study data, were compiled. A model of the DPT notification cascade was developed and key performance indicators for DPT processes were defined. Subpopulation sizes at each cascade step were estimated using data triangulation. Resulting estimates were systematically checked for internal consistency and consistency with other up- or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic simulations were performed to explore robustness of results.

ResultsFor the Canton of Zurich, we estimate that 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in September 2020, of whom 324 received and entered a CovidCode. This triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 proximity contacts and led to 722 infoline calls. In total, 170 callers received a quarantine recommendation, and 30 app users tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after an app notification, reflecting a performance above the national level.

Based on this quantification, key performance indicators were evaluated. For September 2020, these analyses suggest that SwissCovid triggered quarantine recommendations in the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. Per 11 CovidCodes entered in the app, we estimate that almost 1 contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon app notification.

However, longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrate bottlenecks in the notification cascade, as capacity limits were reached due to large increases in SARS-CoV-2 incidence in October 2020.

ConclusionAlthough requiring confirmation, our estimations on the number of notified proximity contacts receiving quarantine recommendations or testing positive after notification suggest relevant contributions to mitigating the pandemic. Increasing SwissCovid app uptake and improving notification cascade performance may further enhance its impact.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the real-life impact of Digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps on interrupting SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains?

FindingsThis data-informed simulation study found that, in the canton of Zurich, the number of app notified persons receiving a quarantine recommendation corresponds to the equivalent of up to 5% of all mandatory quarantined contacts identified by manual contact tracing. Furthermore, about 1 in 11 notification triggers led to SARS-CoV-2 testing of an exposed proximity contact who was consecutively tested positive.

149,A cautionary note on recall vaccination in ex-COVID-19 subjects,"Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA or adenovirus require a first jab followed by recall immunization. There is no indication as to whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 should be vaccinated, and if so, if they should receive one or two vaccine doses. Here, we tested the antibody response developed after the first dose of the mRNA based vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (BNT162b2) in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of COVID-19 (ExCOVID). Post-vaccine antibodies in ExCOVID individuals increase exponentially within 7-15 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (p<0.0001). We developed a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model with l2 regularization to predict the IgG response for SARS-COV-2 vaccine. We found that the antibody response of ExCOVID patients depends on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the symptoms that they developed during the disorder, with anosmia/dysgeusia and gastrointestinal disorders being the most significantly positively correlated in the LR. Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient to induce a good antibody response in ExCOVID subjects. On the contrary, a second dose might switch-off the immune response due to antigen exhaustion, which occurs in response to several viruses or drive the development of low-affinity antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 which may foster an antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) reaction when re-exposed to the virus. These results question whether a second shot in ExCOVID subjects is indeed required and suggest to post-pone it while monitoring antibody response longevity.",Riccardo Levi; Elena Azzolini; Chiara Pozzi; Leonardo Ubaldi; Michele Lagioia; Alberto Mantovani; Maria Rescigno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250923,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250923,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
150,First indication of the effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on the course of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel,"Concomitantly with rolling out its rapid COVID-19 vaccine program, Israel is experiencing its third, and so far largest, surge in morbidity. We aimed to estimate whether the high vaccine coverage among individuals aged over 60 years old creates an observable change in disease dynamics. Using observed and simulated data, we suggest that the shape of the outbreak as measured by daily new moderate and severe cases, and in particular of patients aged over 60, has changed because of vaccination, bringing the decline in new moderate and severe cases earlier than expected, by about a week. Our analyses is consistent with the assumption that vaccination lead to higher than 50% protection in preventing clinical disease and with at least some effectiveness in blocking transmission of elderly population, and supports the importance of prioritizing vulnerable population. This is the first indication of the effectivity of COVID-19 vaccine in changing the course of an ongoing pandemic outbreak.

One Sentence SummaryWe show, by data analysis and modelling of the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, that the current nationwide outbreak, that had up to 0.1% of the population confirmed daily, is clearly affected by the vaccination program, that reached a coverage of more than 80% among people [&ge;] 60 years old.",Hilla De-Leon; Ronit Calderon-Margalit; Francesco Pederiva; Yinon Ashkenazy; Doron Gazit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250630,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250630,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

152,Association Between Preparedness and Response Measures and COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most disruptive global health threat in a century. We analyzed publicly available data on preparedness capacity, COVID-19 incidence and mortality, governance, and testing. Although other analyses have suggested that preparedness assessments do not correlate with effective pandemic response, we found that testing rates correlate with both COVID-19 incidence and mortality and strongly correlated with country preparedness capacity as measured by the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). There is a statistically significant association between preparedness capacities and COVID-19 case incidence and an independent association between governance and COVID-19 case and mortality rates. Legislation, surveillance, and risk communication capacities were associated with lower COVID-19 case incidence and mortality. Preparedness and governance are independently associated with COVID-19 pandemic severity. Preparedness capacities are not sufficient -- capacity and governance are both critical to pandemic control. Countries must improve public health systems and implement strong government leadership.

153,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms of young people in the Global South: evidence from a four-country cohort study,"ObjectiveTo provide evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of adolescents and young adults who grew up in poverty in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs).

DesignA phone survey implemented August-October 2020 to participants of a population-based cohort study since 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-5 and 2001-2 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We examined associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, as well as structural factors (gender, location, wealth); and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, past household wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems and subjective well-being) measured at younger ages.

SettingA diverse, poverty focused sample, reaching those without mobile phones or internet access.

Participants10,496 individuals were approached, 9,730 participated. Overall, 8,988 individuals were included in this study, 4,610 (51%) male and 4,378 (49%) female. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data.

Main outcome measuresAt least mild anxiety and depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7, [&ge;]5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8, [&ge;]5).

ResultsRates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) [95% CI, 38.63-43.12; (29.49-33.74)], and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) [95% CI, 8.16-10.58; (8.33-10.77)], mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Females were most affected in all countries but Ethiopia. In all countries, pandemic-related stressors were associated with increased rates of anxiety and depression, though with varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent and peer relationships were protective factors for mental health while having a long-term health problem or prior emotional problems were risk factors.

ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health of young people. Mental health support is limited in LMICs and young people have to date been lower priority for COVID-19 interventions.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThe study uses data from adolescents and young adults who grew up in poverty in four LMICs which were diversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore investigating a globally vulnerable, but understudied group both in terms of age and wealth.
C_LIO_LIThis study reaches a broad sample of young people who grew up in poverty, including those without internet or mobile phone access.
C_LIO_LIA key strength is combining a broad range of pandemic-related stressors from survey data on experiences of COVID-19 with previously measured information on longer-term risk and protective factors, therefore contributing to a more complete picture of COVID-19 effects.

154,Diagnostic performance of standard and inverted grey-scale CXR in detection of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients. A single institution study in the region of Abu Dhabi.,"PurposeTo evaluate diagnostic performance of greyscale and inverted greyscale Chest X-ray (CXR) using Computed Tomography (CT) scan as a gold standard.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, electronic medical records of 120 patients who had valid CXR and High-resolution CT (HRCT) within less than 24 hours after having a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test during the period from May 19 th to May 23 rd 2020 in a single tertiary care center were reviewed.

PA chest radiographs were presented on 2 occasions to 5 radiologists to evaluate the role and appropriateness of greyscale and inverted greyscale chest radiographs (CXR). The images were viewed on high-specification viewing systems using a primary display monitors and compared it to computed tomography (CT) findings for screening and management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

ResultsNinety-six (80%) patients had positive CT findings, 81 (67.5%) had positive grey scale CXR lesions, and 25 (20.8%) had better detection in the inverted grey scale CXR. The CXR sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia was 93.8% (95% CI (86.2% - 98.0%) and the specificity was 48.7% (95% CI (32.4% - 65.2%). The CXR sensitivity of detection of lung lesions was slightly higher in male (95.1% (95% CI (86.3% - 99.0%)) than female (90.0% (95% CI (68.3% - 98.8%)), while the specificity was 48.0% (95% CI (27.8% - 68.7%) and 50.0% (95% CI (23.0% - 77.0%) in males and females, respectively. However, no significant difference was detected in ROC area between men and women.

ConclusionsThe sensitivity of detection of lung lesions of CXR was relatively high, particularly in men. The results of the study support the idea of considering conventional radiographs as an important diagnostic tool in suspected COVID-19 patients especially in healthcare facilities where there is no access to HRCT scans.

HighlightsO_LICXR shows high sensitivity for detecting lung lesions in HRCT confirmed COVID-19 patients.

155,Home Food Procurement Impacts Food Security and Diet Quality during COVID-19,"BackgroundHome food procurement (HFP) (i.e. gardening, fishing, foraging, hunting, backyard livestock and canning) have historically been important ways that people obtain food. Recently, some HFP activities have grown (e.g. gardening), while other activities (e.g. hunting) have become less common in the United States. Anecdotally, COVID-19 has sparked an increase in HFP evidenced by increased hunting licenses and shortages in seeds and canning supplies. HFP may have positive benefits for food security and diet quality, though research beyond gardening is especially limited in high-income countries.

MethodsWe examine HFP activities before and since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their relationship to food security and dietary quality using multivariable logit models and matching analysis with a statewide representative survey (n=600) of residents of Vermont, United States.

ResultsWe find 29% of respondent households classified as food insecure since COVID-19, and more prevalence among those experiencing a negative job change since COVID-19, households earning less than $50,000 annually, Hispanic and multi-race respondents. Forty-two percent of respondents engaged in HFP activities; the majority of those gardened, and more than half pursued HFP activities more intensely than before the pandemic. HFP was more common among food insecure households, who were more likely to fish, forage, hunt and have backyard livestock. Respondents who were food insecure, Black, Indigenous, People of Color and/or Hispanic, those with a negative job disruption, and larger households all had greater odds of increased intensity of HFP since COVID-19. HFP were significantly associated with eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables, especially if gardening and canning, while respondents hunting or having backyard livestock were significantly more likely to have higher red meat intake.

ConclusionOverall, these results suggest that HFP activities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be an important safety net for food insecure households, and provide diet quality impacts. Long-term, HFP activities may have important food security and diet quality impacts, as well as conservation implications, which should be more thoroughly explored. Regardless, the increased interest and intensity of HFP demonstrates multiple opportunities for educational and outreach efforts.",Meredith T. Niles; Kristen Brassard Wirkkala; Emily H.

156,Standard and anomalous second waves in the COVID-19 pandemic,"We apply a generalised logistic growth model, with time dependent parameters, to describe the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries that exhibit a second wave of infections. The model parameters vary as a function of time according to a logistic function, whose two extreme values, i.e., for early and late times, characterise the first and second waves, respectively. We show that the theoretical curves are in excellent agreement with the empirical data for all cases considered. The model also allows for predictions about the time of occurrence and relative severity of the second wave, in comparison to the first wave. It is shown furthermore that the COVID-19 second waves can be generically classified in two main types, namely, standard and anomalous second waves, according as to whether the second wave starts well after or still during the first wave, respectively. We have also observed that the standard second waves tend, in their majority, to be more severe than the corresponding first wave, whereas for anomalous second waves the opposite occurs.",Giovani L.

157,Muscle strength is associated with COVID-19 hospitalization in adults 50 years of age and older,"Background. Muscle strength has been associated with a wide range of health outcomes. Yet, whether individuals with weaker strength are more at risk for severe COVID-19 is still unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the independent association between muscle strength and COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods. Data from 3600 adults 50 years of age and older were analyzed using logistic models adjusted for several chronic conditions, body mass index, age, and sex. Hand grip strength was repeatedly measured between 2004 and 2017 using a handheld dynamometer. COVID-19 hospitalization during the lockdown was self-reported in summer 2020 and was used an indicator of COVID-19 severity. Results. Results showed that higher grip strength was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per increase of 1 SD in grip strength = .64, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = .45-.87, p = .015). Results also showed that age (OR for a 10-year period = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.32-2.20, p < .001) and obesity (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.00-3.69, p = .025) was associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Sensitivity analyses using different measures of grip strength and robustness analyses based on rare-events logistic regression and COVID-19 patients were consistent with the main results.

159,CovRadar: Continuously tracking and filtering SARS-CoV-2 mutations for molecular surveillance,"SummaryThe ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of molecular surveillance to understand the evolution of the virus and to monitor and plan the epidemiological responses. Quick analysis, easy visualization and convenient filtering of the latest viral sequences are essential for this purpose. We present CovRadar, a tool for molecular surveillance of the Corona spike protein. The spike protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is used as a target for most vaccine candidates. CovRadar consists of a workflow pipeline and a web application that enable the analysis and visualization of over 250,000 sequences. First, CovRadar extracts the regions of interest using local alignment, then builds a multiple sequence alignment, infers variants, consensus sequences and phylogenetic trees and finally presents the results in an interactive PDF-like app, making reporting fast, easy and flexible.

160,Potent in vitro Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by Hetero-bivalent Alpaca Nanobodies Targeting the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain,"Cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 requires the binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As such, RBD has become the major target for vaccine development, while RBD-specific antibodies are pursued as therapeutics. Here, we report the development and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific VHH/nanobody (Nb) from immunized alpacas. Seven RBD-specific Nbs with high stability were identified using phage display. They bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with affinity KD ranging from 2.6 to 113 nM, and six of them can block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The fusion of the Nbs with IgG1 Fc resulted in homodimers with greatly improved RBD-binding affinities (KD ranging from 72.7 pM to 4.5 nM) and nanomolar RBD-ACE2 blocking abilities. Furthermore, fusion of two Nbs with non-overlapping epitopes resulted in hetero-bivalent Nbs, namely aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with significantly higher RBD binding affinities (KD of 59.2 pM and 0.25 nM) and greatly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The 50% neutralization dose (ND50) of aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7 was 1.22 ng/mL ([~]0.043 nM) and 3.18 ng/mL ([~]0.111 nM), respectively. These high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 blocking Nbs could be further developed into therapeutics as well as diagnosis reagents for COVID-19.

ImportanceTo date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous loss of human life and economic output worldwide. Although a few COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in several countries, the development of effective therapeutics including SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies remains critical. Due to their small size (13-15 kDa), highly solubility and stability, Nbs are particularly well suited for pulmonary delivery and more amenable to engineer into multi-valent formats, compared to the conventional antibody. Here, we report a serial of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nbs isolated from immunized alpaca and two engineered hetero-bivalent Nbs. These potent neutralizing Nbs showed promise as potential therapeutics against COVID-19.",Huan Ma; Weihong Zeng; Xiangzhi Meng; Xiaoxue Huang; Yunru Yang; Dan Zhao; Peigen Zhou; Xiaofang Wang; Changcheng Zhao; Yong Sun; Peihui Wang; Huichao Ou; Xiaowen Hu; Yan Xiang; Tengchuan Jin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429311,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429311,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
161,Protective immune trajectories in early viral containment of non-pneumonic SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The immune system of most SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals limits viral spread to the upper airways without pulmonary involvement. This prevents the development of pneumonic COVID-19. However, the protective immunological responses causative of successful viral containment in the upper airways remain unclear. Here, we combine longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomic profiling, multidimensional flow cytometry, RNA-Seq of FACS-sorted leukocyte subsets and multiplex plasma interferon profiling to uncover temporally resolved protective immune signatures in non-pneumonic and ambulatory SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

We compare host responses in a high-risk patient population infected with SARS-CoV-2 but without pulmonary involvement to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Our data reveal a distinct immunological signature of successful viral containment, characterized by an early prominent interferon stimulated gene (ISG) upregulation across immune cell subsets. In addition, reduced cytotoxic potential of Natural Killer (NK) and T cells, as well as a monocyte phenotype with immune-modulatory potential are hallmarks of protective immunity. Temporal resolution across disease trajectories highlights ISG upregulation as particularly prominent early in the disease and confirms increased expression also in comparison to healthy controls.

We validate this distinct temporal ISG signature by in-depth RNA-seq of FACS-sorted leukocyte subsets in a large prospective ambulatory SARS-CoV-2 infected cohort confirming early and robust ISG upregulation particularly in monocytes and T cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a protective ISG phenotype in patients with successful containment of SARS-CoV-2 infection without progression to COVID-19. This early protective interferon response might be exploited as a therapeutic approach and for disease course prediction.",Kami Pekayvaz; Alexander Leunig; Rainer Kaiser; Sophia Brambs; Markus Joppich; Aleksandar Janjic; Oliver Popp; Vivien Polewka; Lucas Esteban Wange; Christoph Gold; Marieluise Kirchner; Maximilian Muenchhoff; Johannes C.

162,"In silico, in vitro and in cellulo models for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 spike/human ACE2 complex, viral entry and cell fusion","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a novel computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context, and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429555,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429555,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False

We have developed and assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of two formulations (1mg and 2mg) of ZyCoV-D (a plasmid DNA based vaccine candidates) administered through Needle Free Injection System (NFIS) and syringe-needle (intradermal) in rhesus macaques with three dose vaccine regimens. The vaccine candidate 2mg dose administered using Needle Free Injection System (NFIS) elicited a significant immune response with development of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike region specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers during the immunization phase and significant enhancement in the levels after the virus challenge. In 2 mg NFIS group the IgG and NAb titers were maintained and showed gradual rise during the immunization period (15 weeks) and till 2 weeks after the virus challenge. It also conferred better protection to macaques evident by the viral clearance from nasal swab, throat swab and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens in comparison with macaques from other immunized groups. In contrast, the animals from placebo group developed high levels of viremia and lung disease following the virus challenge. Besides this, the vaccine candidate also induced increase lymphocyte proliferation and cytokines response (IL-6, IL-5).The administration of the vaccine candidate with NFIS generated a better immunogenicity response in comparison to syringe-needle (intradermal route).

164,Identification of the SHREK family of proteins as broad-spectrum host antiviral factors,"Mucins and mucin-like molecules are highly glycosylated, high-molecular-weight cell surface proteins that possess a semi-rigid and highly extended extracellular domain. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a mucin-like glycoprotein, has recently been found to restrict HIV-1 infectivity through virion incorporation that sterically hinders virus particle attachment to target cells. Here, we report the identification of a family of antiviral cellular proteins, named the Surface-Hinged, Rigidly-Extended Killer (SHREK) family of virion inactivators (PSGL-1, CD43, TIM-1, CD34, PODXL1, PODXL2, CD164, MUC1, MUC4, and TMEM123), that share similar structural characteristics with PSGL-1. We demonstrate that SHREK proteins block HIV-1 infectivity by inhibiting virus particle attachment to target cells. In addition, we demonstrate that SHREK proteins are broad-spectrum host antiviral factors that block the infection of diverse viruses such as influenza A. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a subset of SHREKs also blocks the infectivity of a hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle. These results suggest that SHREK proteins may be a part of host innate immunity against enveloped viruses.",Deemah Dabbagh; Sijia He; Brian Hetrick; Linda Chilin; Ali Andalibi; Yuntao Wu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429469,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429469,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False

Here, we demonstrate that a single intranasal administration of a lentiviral vector encoding a prefusion form of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein induces full protection of respiratory tracts and totally avoids pulmonary inflammation in the susceptible hamster model. More importantly, we generated a new transgenic mouse strain, expressing the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2, with unprecedent brain permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication and developing a lethal disease in <4 days post infection. Even though the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is now well established, so far other vaccine strategies under development have not taken into the account the protection of central nervous system.

Since CD4 T cell responses are of critical importance to the antibody response, we examined the global effects of N501Y mutation on MHC-II presentation compared to the N501 wildtype and found poorer presentation across the majority of MHC-II alleles. This suggests that the N501Y mutation may not only diminish binding of antibodies to the RBD but also interfere with their production by weakening the cooperation between T and B cells, facilitating immune escape.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429431,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429431,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
167,Impact of the B.1.1.7 variant on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognizing diverse epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 Spike,"The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the ACE2 receptor on host cells is essential for viral entry. RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To fully understand how these mutations affect the antigenicity of Spike, we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as a sorting bait, we isolated >100 Spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. ~45% showed neutralizing activity of which ~20% were NTD-specific. None of the S2-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed that NTD-specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes need to be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.",Luke Muir; Weng M Ng; Helen M. E.

168,Multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics demonstrate very high potency against mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 100 million people globally, and continues to undergo genomic evolution. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies.

Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development start to lose potency against various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against such variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin(R) domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape.

Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that both multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics, ensovibep (MP0420) and MP0423, are highly potent against the new circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) and the most frequent emerging mutations in the spike protein. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multi-specific DARPin(R) antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin(R) molecules, suggests ensovibep and MP0423 as superior alternatives to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin(R) platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.",Sylvia Rothenberger; Marcel Walser; Francesca Malvezzi; Jennifer Mayor; Sarah Ryter; Hector Moreno; Nicole Liechti; Silvan Halg; Andreas Bosshart; Chloe Iss; Valerie Calabro; Andreas Cornelius; Tanja Hospodarsch; Alexandra Neculcea; Thamar Looser; Susanne Mangold; Christian Reichen; Filip Radom; Keith M.

169,A high-throughput radioactivity-based assay for screening SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex,"Frequent outbreaks of novel coronaviruses (CoVs), highlighted by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, necessitate the development of therapeutics that could be easily and effectively administered world-wide. The conserved mRNA-capping process enables CoVs to evade their host immune system and is a target for antiviral development. Nonstructural protein (nsp) 16 in complex with nsp10 catalyzes the final step of coronaviral mRNA-capping through its 2-O-methylation activity. Like other methyltransferases, SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex is druggable. However, the availability of an optimized assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) is an unmet need. Here, we report the development of a radioactivity-based assay for methyltransferase activity of nsp10-nsp16 complex in a 384-well format, and kinetic characterization, and optimization of the assay for HTS (Z'-factor: 0.83). Considering the high conservation of nsp16 across known CoV species, the potential inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex may also be effective against other emerging pathogenic CoVs.",Aliakbar Khalili Yazdi; Fengling Li; Kanchan Devkota; Sumera Perveen; Pegah Ghiabi; Taraneh Hajian; Albina Bolotokova; Masoud Vedadi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429625,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429625,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
170,Characterization of the NiRAN domain from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase provides insights into a potential therapeutic target against SARS-CoV-2,"Apart from the canonical fingers, palm and thumb domains, the RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) from the viral order Nidovirales possess two additional domains. Of these, the function of the Nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyl transferase domain (NiRAN) remains unanswered. The elucidation of the 3D structure of RdRp from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), provided the first ever insights into the domain organisation and possible functional characteristics of the NiRAN domain. Using in silico tools, we predict that the NiRAN domain assumes a kinase or phosphotransferase like fold and binds nucleoside triphosphates at its proposed active site. Additionally, using molecular docking we have predicted the binding of three widely used kinase inhibitors and five well characterized anti-microbial compounds at the NiRAN domain active site along with their drug-likeliness as well as DFT properties. For the first time ever, using basic biochemical tools, this study shows the presence of a kinase like activity exhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Interestingly, the proposed kinase inhibitors and a few of the predicted nucleotidyl transferase inhibitors significantly inhibited the aforementioned enzymatic activity. In line with the current global COVID-19 pandemic urgency and the emergence of newer strains with significantly higher infectivity, this study provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug target and potential lead compounds for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2.",Abhisek Dwivedy; Richard Mariadasse; Mohammed Ahmad; Sayan Chakraborty; Deepsikha Kar; Satish Tiwari; Tanmay Majumdar; Jeyaraman Jeyakanthan; Bichitra Biswal,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429510,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429510,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
171,Molecular dynamics simulation study of effects of key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 on protein structures,"SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading rapidly since 2019 and has produced large-scale mutations in the genomes. Differences in gene sequences may lead to changes in protein structure and traits, which would have a great impact on the epidemiological characteristics. In this study, we selected the key mutations of SARS-CoV-2, including D614G and A222V of S protein and Q57H of ORF3a protein, to conduct molecular dynamics simulation and analysis on the structures of the mutant proteins. The results suggested that D614G improved the stability of S protein, while A222V enhanced the ability of protein to react with the outside environment. Q57H enhanced the structural flexibility of ORF3a protein. Our findings could complete the mechanistic link between genotype--phenotype--epidemiological characteristics in the study of SARS-CoV-2. We also found no significant changes in the antigenicity of S protein, ORF3a protein and their mutants, which provides reference for vaccine development and application.",Jerome Rumdon Lon; Binbin Xi; Bingxu Zhong; Yiyuan Zheng; Pei Guo; Zixi Chen; Hongli Du,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429495,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429495,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
172,Variation in predicted COVID-19 risk among lemurs and lorises,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans leads to the disease COVID-19, has caused global disruption and more than 1.5 million fatalities since it first emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection rates are currently at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary viral target is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predicts that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results and finds additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and Endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their health should be a conservation priority.

173,Exaggerated cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 and its inhibition by dexamethasone,"An understanding of the pathological inflammatory mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is necessary in order to discover new molecular pharmacological targets for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. In this study, the effects of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Stimulation with spike glycoprotein S1 (100 ng/mL) resulted in significant elevation in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-8. However, pre-treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM) caused a significant reduction in the release of these cytokines. Further experiments revealed that S1 stimulation of PBMCs increased phosphorylation of NF-{kappa}B p65 and I{kappa}B, while increasing I{kappa}B degradation. DNA binding of NF-{kappa}B p65 was also significantly increased following stimulation with S1. Treatment of PBMCs with dexamethasone (100 nM) or BAY11 -7082 (1 M) resulted in inhibition of S1 -induced NF-{kappa}B activation. Activation of p38 MAPK by S1 was blocked in the presence of dexamethasone and SKF 86002. CRID3, but not dexamethasone pre-treatment produced significant inhibition of S1-induced activation of NLRP3/caspase-1. Further experiments revealed that S1-induced increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-8 was reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 and SKF 86002, while CRID3 pre-treatment resulted in the reduction of IL-1{beta} production. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulate PBMCs to release pro-inflammatory cytokines through mechanisms involving activation of NF-{kappa}B, p38 MAPK and NLRP3 inflammasome. It is proposed that clinical benefits of dexamethasone in COVID-19 is possibly due to its anti-inflammatory activity in reducing SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm.",Olumayokun A Olajide; Victoria U Iwuanyanwu; Izabela Lepiarz-Raba; Alaa A Al-Hindawi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429536,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429536,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
174,Short report: Ethnicity and COVID-19 death in the early part of the COVID-19 second wave in England: an analysis of OpenSAFELY data from 1st September to 9th November 2020,"Black and minority ethnic groups were at raised risk of dying from COVID-19 during the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic in England. We aimed to investigate whether ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 deaths were similar in the more recent ""second wave"" of the epidemic. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used primary care and linked ONS mortality data within the OpenSAFELY platform. All adults in the database at 1st September 2020 and with at least 1 year of prior follow-up and a record of ethnicity were included. The outcome was COVID-19-related death (death with COVID-19 listed as a cause of death on the death certificate). Follow-up was to 9th November 2020. Hazard ratios for ethnicity were calculated using Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex, and then further adjusted for deprivation. 13,223,154 people were included. During the study period, people of South Asian ethnicity were at higher risk of death due to COVID-19 than white people after adjusting for age and sex (HR = 3.47, 95% CI 2.99-4.03); the association attenuated somewhat on further adjustment for index of multiple deprivation (HR = 2.86, 2.46-3.33, Table 2). In contrast with the first wave of the epidemic, we found little evidence of a raised risk in black or other ethnic groups compared to white (HR for black vs white = 1.28, 0.87-1.88 adjusted for age and sex; and 1.01, 0.69-1.49 further adjusted for deprivation). Our findings suggest that ethnic inequalities in the risk of dying COVID-19-related death have changed between the first and early second wave of the epidemic in England.

175,Knowledge and Awareness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Chinese dental students----a comparison study.,"BackgroudThis study aimed to measure the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Chinese dental students during the global outbreak recently.

MethodA descriptive cross-sectional study was performed among dental students and nonmedical college students in China. All the participants were required to anonymously answer a reliable online questionnaire, which covered 3 different fields of COVID-19. Average scores of dental students (D group), including junior (JD group) and senior dental students (SD group), and nonmedical college students (N group) were compared respectively. Chi-square test and independent sample T test were taken for statistical analysis with SPSS.12.

ResultsTotally 497 questionnaires were collected, including 224 from dental students and 273 from non-medical students. The overall average score was 57{+/-}19.2. The average scores of dental students were 64.5{+/-}18. The D group had significantly higher scores on the total score, section scores, and 20 questions respectively than with the N group. No significant differences were found on 5 questions. Compared with the N group, the SD group won on all three sections while JD group failed to win on the diagnose section.

ConclusionAlthough the dental student showed good awareness regarding the clinical aspects of COVID-19 than non-medical students, there are still some weakness in the part of treatment and prevention, which need to be strengthened for better prepare during work. Besides, the low accuracy rate of lower grade dental students is also worth noting.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429522,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429522,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
176,'Phytopathological strolls' in the dual context of COVID-19 lockdown and IYPH2020: transforming constraints into an opportunity for public education about plant pathogens,"The experience presented here relates to 2020, a particularly timely year for plant disease-related communication ( International Year of Plant Health IYPH2020), but also a unique year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal was to illustrate the diversity and beauty of fungal plant pathogens through a naturalist approach that could be followed by any amateur. We achieved this end through  phytopathological strolls, in which we observed and determined the origin of symptoms on diseased plants found in our garden, in the local streets, in nearby open spaces, and sharing this matter with a broad public. The lockdown imposed in France created an additional motivation to take up the challenge, and to involve our children, even under strong constraints, such as movement restrictions. We observed and described fungal pathogens through hundreds of photographs, shared our findings with a large audience on Twitter, and received feedback. The material used was deliberately simple and transportable: a digital reflex camera, an old microscope, a mobile phone, some books and an Internet connexion. Between March 17 March and December 15, 2020 we found 148 plant pathogens, including 72 rusts, 22 powdery mildews and 22 septoria-like diseases. We discuss here the importance of promoting searches for plant pathogens, their description and conservation, through a combination of classical approaches and digital tools in tune with the times, such as Twitter, by treating pathogen identification like a detective game and, more surprisingly, by making use of the addictive nature of collection approaches, drawing a parallel with Pokemon Go.",Frédéric Suffert; Muriel Suffert,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429201,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429201,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False

Those whose research required physical presence in a lab or the field experienced considerable disruption and productivity decrease. About 82% of this group will try to permanently reduce their work dependency on physical presence. Parents and those taking care of vulnerable dependents have been spending less time on research due to their role conflict. We further observed a gender gap in the overall disruption consequences; more female researchers have been experiencing a reduction in productivity and external pressure to make progress.

Global concerns have been raised for its potential to affect vaccine efficacy. Here, we evaluated the neutralization activities of two vaccines developed in China against 501Y.V2. One is licensed inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV and the other one is recombinant dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) vaccine ZF2001. Encouragingly, both vaccines largely preserved neutralizing titres, with slightly reduction, against 501Y.V2 authentic virus compare to their titres against both original SARS-CoV-2 and the currently circulating D614G virus.

179,Radius of Gyration as predictor of COVID-19 deaths trend with three-weeks offset,"Total and perimetral lockdowns were the strongest nonpharmaceutical interventions to fight against Covid-19, as well as the with the strongest socioeconomic collateral effects. Lacking a metric to predict the effect of lockdowns in the spreading of COVID-19, authorities and decision-makers opted for preventive measures that showed either too strong or not strong enough after a period of two to three weeks, once data about hospitalizations and deaths was available. We present here the radius of gyration as a candidate predictor of the trend in deaths by COVID-19 with an offset of three weeks. Indeed, the radius of gyration aggregates the most relevant microscopic aspects of human mobility into a macroscopic value, very sensitive to temporary trends and local effects, such as lockdowns and mobility restrictions. We use mobile phone data of more than 13 million users in Spain during a period of one year (from January 6th 2020 to January 10th 2021) to compute the users daily radius of gyration and compare the median value of the population with the evolution of COVID-19 deaths: we find that for all weeks where the radius of gyration is above a critical value (70% of its pre-pandemic score) the number of weekly deaths increases three weeks after. The reverse also stands: for all weeks where the radius of gyration is below the critical value, the number of weekly deaths decreased after three weeks. This observation leads to two conclusions: i) the radius of gyration can be used as a predictor of COVID-19-related deaths; and ii) partial mobility restrictions are as effective as a total lockdown as far the radius of gyration is below this critical value.

BackgroundAuthorities around the World have used lockdowns and partial mobility restrictions as major nonpharmaceutical interventions to control the expansion of COVID-19. While effective, the efficiency of these measures on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths is difficult to quantify, severely limiting the feedback that can be used to tune the intensity of these measures. In addition, collateral socioeconomic effects challenge the overall effectiveness of lockdowns in the long term, and the degree by which they are followed can be difficult to estimate. It is desirable to find both a metric to accurately monitor the mobility restrictions and a predictor of their effectiveness.

MethodsWe correlate the median of the daily radius of gyration of more than 13M users in Spain during all of 2020 with the evolution of COVID-19 deaths for the same period. Mobility data is obtained from mobile phone metadata from one of the major operators in the country.

ResultsThe radius of gyration is a predictor of the trend in the number of COVID-19 deaths with 3 weeks offset. When the radius is above/below a critical threshold (70% of the pre-pandemic score), the number of deaths increases/decreases three weeks later.

ConclusionsThe radius of gyration can be used to monitor in real time the effectiveness of the mobility restrictions. The existence of a critical threshold suggest that partial lockdowns can be as efficient as total lockdowns, while reducing their socioeconomic impact. The mechanism behind the critical value is still unknow, and more research is needed.",Alberto Hernando de Castro; David Mateo; Jordi Bayer; Ignacio Barrios,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250708,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250708,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True
180,COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and inequity in the United States: Results from a nationally representative survey,"BackgroundAt the time of this survey, September 1st, there were roughly 6 million COVID-19 cases and 176,771 deaths in the United States and no federally approved vaccine. The objective of this study was to explore the willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States and describe variability in this acceptability by key racial, ethnic and socio-demographic characteristics.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional digital survey that sampled participants from a nationally-representative panel maintained by a third party, Dynata. Dynata randomly sampled their database and emailed web-based surveys to United States residents ensuring the sample was matched to US Census estimates for age, race, gender, income, and Census region. Participants were asked how willing or unwilling they would be to: 1) receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it was made publicly available, and 2) receive the influenza vaccine for the upcoming influenza season. Participants could respond with extremely willing, willing, unwilling, or extremely unwilling. For those who reported being unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, reasons for this hesitancy were captured. All participants were asked about where they obtain vaccine-related information, and which sources they trust most. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association of all demographic characteristics with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

FindingsFrom September 1st to September 7, 2020, 1592 respondents completed the online survey. Overall, weighted analyses found that only 58.9% of the sample population were either willing or extremely willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it was made publicly available. In comparison, 67.7% of the respondents were willing or extremely willing to take the influenza vaccine. By gender, 66.1% of males and 51.5% of females were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Males were significantly more willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.98, 95% CI: 1.56, 2.53; p<0.001) than females. Blacks were the least willing racial/ethnic group (48.8%) Blacks, (aOR=0.59, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.80; p<0.001) were significantly less willing, than whites, to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. There were numerous reasons provided for being unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The most common reason was concern about the vaccines safety (36.9%), followed by concerns over its efficacy (19.1%).

InterpretationIn conclusion, we found that a substantial proportion (41%) of United States residents are unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as one is made publicly available. We found that vaccine acceptance differs by sub-populations. In addition to sub-group differences in willingness to receive the vaccine, respondents provided a variety of reasons for being unwilling to receive the vaccine, driven by various sources of vaccine information (and misinformation). This compounds the challenge of delivering a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine at a population level to achieve herd immunity.

181,Sustainable targeted interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic: A big data-driven modeling study in Hong Kong,"BackgroundThe nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for contact suppression have been widely used worldwide, which impose harmful burdens on the population and the local economy. The evaluation of alternative NPIs is needed to confront the pandemic with less disruption. By harnessing human mobility data, we develop an agent-based model that can evaluate the efficacies of NPIs with individualized mobility simulations. Based on the model, we propose the data-driven targeted interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong without city-wide NPIs.

MethodsWe develop a data-driven agent-based model for 7.55 million Hong Kong residents to evaluate the efficacies of various NPIs in the first 80 days of the initial outbreak. The entire territory of Hong Kong is split into 4,905 500mx500m grids. The model can simulate detailed agent interactions based on the demographics data, public facilities and functional buildings, transportation systems, and travel patterns. The general daily human mobility patterns are adopted from Googles Community Mobility Report. The scenario without any NPIs is set as the baseline. By simulating the epidemic progression and human movement at the individual level, we proposed model-driven targeted interventions, which focus on the surgical testing and quarantine of only a small portion of regions instead of enforcing NPIs in the whole city. The efficacious of common NPIs and the proposed targeted interventions are evaluated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

FindingsWithout NPIs, we estimate that there are 128,711 total infections (IQR 23,511-70,310) by the end of the 80-day simulation. The proposed targeted intervention averts 95.85% and 94.13% of baseline infections with only 100 (2.04%) and 50 (1.02%) grids being quarantined, respectively. Mild social distancing without testing results in 16,503 total cases (87.18% infections averted), rapid implementation of full lockdown and testing measures (such as the control measure in Mainland China) performs the best, with only 805 infections (99.37% infections averted). Testing-and-quarantining 10%, 20%, 50% of all symptomatic cases with 24-hour/48-hour avert 89.92%/ 87.78%, 95.47%/ 92.42%, and 97.93%/ 95.61% infections, respectively.

InterpretationBig data-driven mobility modeling can inform targeted interventions, which are able to effectively contain the COVID-19 outbreak with much lower disruption of the city.

183,COVID-19 risk perceptions of social interaction and essential activities and inequity in the United States: Results from a nationally representative survey,"IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related diagnoses, hospitalizations, and deaths have disproportionately affected disadvantaged communities across the United States. Few studies have sought to understand how risk perceptions related to social interaction and essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic vary by sociodemographic factors, information that could inform targeted interventions to reduce inequities in access to care and information.

MethodsWe conducted a nationally representative online survey of 1,592 adults in the United States to understand risk perceptions related to transmission of COVID-19 for various social and essential activities. We assessed relationships for each activity, after weighting to adjust for the survey design, using bivariate comparisons and multivariable logistic regression modeling, between responses of safe and unsafe, and participant characteristics, including age, gender, race, education, income, and political affiliation.

ResultsHalf of participants were younger than 45 years (n=844, 53.0%), female (n=800, 50.3%), and White/Caucasian (n=685, 43.0%), Black/African American (n=410, 25.8%), or Hispanic/Latino (n=382, 24.0%). Risk perceptions of unsafe for 13 activities ranged from 29.2% to 73.5%. Large gatherings, indoor dining, and visits with elderly relatives had the highest proportion of unsafe responses (>58%) while activities outdoor, visiting the doctor or dentist, and going to the grocery store had the lowest (<36%). Older respondents were more likely to view social gatherings and indoor activities as unsafe, yet more likely to view activities such as going to the grocery store, participating in outdoor activities, visiting elderly relatives, and visiting the doctor or emergency room as safe. Compared to White/Caucasian respondents, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino respondents were more likely to view activities such as dining and visiting friends outdoor as unsafe. Generally, men vs. women, Republicans vs. Democrats and independents, and individuals with higher vs. lower income were more likely to view activities as safe.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest the importance of sociodemographic differences in risk perception, health behaviors, and access to information and health care when implementing efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

184,"Successful reboot of high-performance sporting activities by Japanese national women's handball team in Tokyo, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic: An initiative by Japan Sports-Cyber Physical System (JS-CPS) of Sports Research Innovation Project (SRIP)","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted sporting activities across the world. However, practical training strategies for athletes to reduce the risk of infection during the pandemic has not been definitively studied.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this report was to provide an overview of our challenges encountered during the reboot of high-performance sporting activities of the Japanese national handball team during the 3rd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo, Japan.

MethodsTwenty-nine Japanese national womens handball players and 24 staff participated in the study. To initiate the reboot of their first training camp after COVID-19 stay-home social policy, we conducted: web-based health-monitoring, SARS-CoV-2 screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, real-time automated quantitative monitoring of social distancing on-court using video-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, physical intensity evaluation with wearable heart rate (HR) and acceleration sensors, and self-reported online questionnaire.

ResultsThe training camp was conducted successfully with no COVID-19 infections. The web-based health monitoring and the frequent PCR testing with short turnaround times contributed remarkably in early detection of athletes health problems and risk screening. During handball, the AI based on-court social-distancing monitoring revealed key time-dependent spatial metrics to define player-to-player proximity. This information facilitated positive team members on and off-game distancing behavior. Athletes regularly achieved around 80% of maximum HR during training, indicating anticipated improvements in achieving their physical intensities. Self-reported questionnaires related to the COVID management in the training camp revealed a sense of security among the athletes allowing them to focus singularly on their training.

ConclusionThe current challenge provided us considerable know-how to create and manage a safe environment for high-performing athletes in the COVID-19 pandemic via the Japan Sports-Cyber Physical System (JS-CPS) of SRIP (Japan Sports Agency, Tokyo, Japan). This report is envisioned to provide informed decisions to coaches, trainers, policymakers from the sports federations in creating targeted, infection-free, sporting and training environments.",Issei Ogasawara; Shigeto Hamaguchi; Ryosuke Hasegawa; Yukihiro Akeda; Naoki Ota; Gajanan S.

185,Who should be first in line for the COVID-19 vaccine? Surveys in 13 countries of the publics preferences for prioritisation,"How does the public want a COVID-19 vaccine to be allocated? We conducted a conjoint experiment asking 15,536 adults in 13 countries to evaluate 248,576 profiles of potential vaccine recipients that varied randomly on five attributes. Our sample includes diverse countries from all continents. The results suggest that in addition to giving priority to health workers and to those at high risk, the public favours giving priority to a broad range of key workers and to those on lower incomes. These preferences are similar across respondents of different education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across most surveyed countries. The public favoured COVID-19 vaccines being allocated solely via government programs, but were highly polarized in some developed countries on whether taking a vaccine should be mandatory. There is a consensus among the public on many aspects of COVID-19 vaccination which needs to be taken into account when developing and communicating roll-out strategies.",Raymond Duch; Laurence S J Roope; Mara Violato; Matias F Becerra; Thomas Robinson; Jean-Francois Bonnefon; Jorge Friedman; Peter Loewen; Pavan Mamidi; Alessia Melegaro; Mariana Blanco; Juan Vargas; Julia Seither; Paolo Candio; Ana G Cruz; Xinyang Hua; Adrian Barnett; Philip Clarke,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250866,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250866,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True
186,Genetic determination of regional connectivity in modelling the spread of COVID-19 outbreak for improved mitigation strategies,"Covid-19 has resulted in the death of more than 1,500,000 individuals. Due to the pandemics severity, thousands of genomes have been sequenced and publicly stored with extensive records, an unprecedented amount of data for an outbreak in a single year. Simultaneously, prediction models offered region-specific and often contradicting results, while states or countries implemented mitigation strategies with little information on success, precision, or agreement with neighboring regions. Even though viral transmissions have been already documented in a historical and geographical context, few studies aimed to model geographic and temporal flow from viral sequence information. Here, using a case study of 7 states, we model the flow of the Covid-19 outbreak with respect to phylogenetic information, viral migration, inter- and intra- regional connectivity, epidemiologic and demographic characteristics. By assessing regional connectivity from genomic variants, we can significantly improve predictions in modeling the viral spread and intensity.

Contrary to previous results, our study shows that the vast majority of the first outbreak can be traced to very few lineages, despite the existence of multiple worldwide transmissions. Moreover, our results show that while the distance from hotspots is initially important, connectivity becomes increasingly significant as the virus establishes itself. Similarly, isolated local strategies-such as relying on herd immunity-can negatively impact neighboring states. Our work suggests that we can achieve more efficient unified mitigation strategies with selective interventions.",Leonidas Salichos; Jonathan Warrell; Hannah Cevasco; Alvin Chung; Mark Gerstein,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250785,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250785,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True
187,Molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Greece reveals low rates of onward virus transmission after lifting of travel restrictions based on risk assessment during summer 2020,"Molecular epidemiology has provided an additive value to traditional public health tools by identifying SARS-CoV-2 clusters, or providing evidence that clusters based on virus sequences and contact tracing are highly concordant. Our aim was to infer the levels of virus importation and to estimate the impact of public health measures related to travel restrictions to local transmission in Greece. Our phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses included 389 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected during the first 7 months of the pandemic in Greece and a random collection in 5 replicates of 3,000 sequences sampled globally, as well as the best hits to our dataset identified by BLAST. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of 70 genetically distinct viruses identified as independent introductions into Greece. The proportion of imported strains was 41%, 11.5%, and 8.8% during the three periods of sampling, namely, March (no travel restrictions), April to June (strict travel restrictions), and July to September (lifting of travel restrictions based on a thorough risk assessment), respectively. These findings reveal low levels of onward transmission from imported cases during summer and underscore the importance of targeted public health measures that can increase the safety of international travel during a pandemic.",Evangelia Georgia Kostaki; Georgios A.

188,Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies during and after COVID19: Lessons from a biobank in Argentina,"BackgroundBiobanks are instrumental for accelerating research. Early in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Argentinean Biobank of Infectious Diseases (BBEI) initiated the COVID19 collection and started its characterization.

MethodsBlood samples from subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection either admitted to health institutions or outpatients, were enrolled. Highly exposed seronegative individuals, were also enrolled. Longitudinal samples were obtained in a subset of donors, including persons who donated plasma for therapeutic purposes (plasma donors). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG levels, IgG titers and IgG viral neutralization capacity were determined.

FindingsOut of 825 donors, 57.1% were females and median age was 41 years (IQR 32-53 years). Donors were segregated as acute or convalescent donors, and mild versus moderate/severe disease donors. Seventy-eight percent showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Specific IgM and IgG showed comparable positivity rates in acute donors. IgM detectability rate declined in convalescent donors while IgG detectability remained elevated in early (74,8%) and late (83%) convalescent donors. Among donors with follow-up samples, IgG levels seemed to decline more rapidly in plasma donors. IgG levels were higher with age, disease severity, number of symptoms, and was more durable in moderate/severe disease donors. Levels and titers of anti-spike/RBD IgG strongly correlated with neutralization activity against WT virus.

InterpretationThe BBEI-COVID19 collection served a dual role in this SARS-CoV-2 global crisis. First, it feed researchers and developers transferring samples and data to fuel research projects. Second, it generated highly needed local data to understand and frame the regional dynamics of the infection.

190,"Therapeutic antibodies, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike N-terminal domain, protect lethally infected K18-hACE2 mice","Since the onset of the current COVID-19 pandemic, high priority is given to the development of neutralizing antibodies, as a key approach for the design of therapeutic strategies to countermeasure and eradicate the disease. Previously, we reported the development of human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) exhibiting very high protective ability. These mAbs recognize epitopes on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is considered to represent the main rout of receptor engagement by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The recent emergence of viral variants emphasizes the notion that efficient antibody treatments need to rely on mAbs against several distinct key epitopes in order to circumvent the occurrence of therapy escape-mutants. Here we report the isolation and characterization of 12 neutralizing mAbs, identified by screening a phage-display library constructed from lymphatic cells collected from severe COVID-19 patients. The antibodies target three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2, one of them defining a major site of vulnerability of the virus. Extensive characterization of these mAbs suggests a neutralization mechanism which relies both on amino-acid and N-glycan recognition on the virus, and involvement of receptors other than the hACE2 on the target cell. Two of the selected mAbs, which demonstrated superior neutralization potency in vitro, were further evaluated in vivo, demonstrating their ability to fully protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice even when administered at low doses and late after infection. The study demonstrates the high potential of the mAbs for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underlines the possible role of the NTD in mediating infection of host cells via alternative cellular portals other than the canonical ACE2 receptor.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428995,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428995,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,False
191,Evolution of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Interplay Across 247 Vertebrates,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause the most serious pandemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which threatens human health and public safety. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as recognized receptor for its entry into host cell that contributes to the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to hosts. Using computational modeling approach, this study resolved the evolutionary pattern of bonding affinity of ACE2 in 247 jawed vertebrates to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. First, high-or-low binding affinity phenotype divergence of ACE2 to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has appeared in two ancient species of jawed vertebrates, Scyliorhinus torazame (low-affinity, Chondrichthyes) and Latimeria chalumnae (high-affinity, Coelacanthimorpha). Second, multiple independent affinity divergence events recur in fishes, amphibians-reptiles, birds, and mammals. Third, high affinity phenotypes go up in mammals, possibly implying the rapid expansion of mammals might accelerate the evolution of coronaviruses. Fourth, we found natural mutations at eight amino acid sites of ACE2 can determine most of phenotype divergences of bonding affinity in 247 vertebrates and resolved their related structural basis. Moreover, we also identified high-affinity or low-affinity-associated concomitant mutation group.The group linked to extremely high affinity may provide novel potentials for the development of human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) in treating patients with COVID-19 or for constructing genetically modified SARS-CoV-2 infection models promoting vaccines studies.

192,Computational insights into differential interaction of mamalian ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has spread globally. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the host cell receptor that binds to receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein and mediates cell entry. Because the ACE2 proteins are widely available in mammals, it is important to investigate the interactions between the RBD and the ACE2 of other mammals. Here we analyzed the sequences of ACE2 proteins from 16 mammals and predicted the structures of ACE2-RBD complexes. Analyses on sequence, structure, and dynamics synergistically provide valuable insights into the interactions between ACE2 and RBD. The comparison results suggest that the ACE2 of bovine, cat and panda form strong binding with RBD, while in the cases of rat, least horseshoe bat, horse, pig, mouse and civet, the ACE2 proteins interact weakly with RBD.",Cecylia Severin Lupala; Vikash Kumar; Xiao-dong Su; Haiguang Liu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429327,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429327,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,False
193,The basis of a more contagious 501Y.V1 variant of SARS-COV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a world-wide pandemic. A variant of SARS-COV-2 (20I/501Y.V1) recently discovered in the United Kingdom has a single mutation from N501 to Y501 within the receptor binding domain (Y501-RBD), of the Spike protein of the virus. This variant is much more contagious than the original version (N501-RBD). We found that this mutated version of RBD binds to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) a ~10 times more tightly than the native version (N501-RBD). Modeling analysis showed that the N501Y mutation would allow a potential aromatic ring-ring interaction and an additional hydrogen bond between the RBD and ACE2. However, sera from individuals immunized with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine still efficiently block the binding of Y501-RBD to ACE2 though with a slight compromised manner by comparison with their ability to inhibit binding to ACE2 of N501-RBD. This may raise the concern whether therapeutic anti-RBD antibodies used to treat COVID-19 patients are still efficacious. Nevertheless, a therapeutic antibody, Bamlanivimab, still binds to the Y501-RBD as efficiently as its binds to N501-RBD.",Gongyi Zhang; Haolin Liu; Qianqian Zhang; Pengcheng Wei; Zhongzhou Chen; Katja Aviszus; John Yang; Walter Downing; Shelley Peterson; Chengyu Jiang; Bo Liang; Lyndon Reynoso; Gregory Downey; Stephen Frankel; John Kapper; Philippa Marrack,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428884,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428884,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,False
194,Emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19,"The complexities involved in modeling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 has been a major roadblock in achieving predictability in the spread and containment of the disease. In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model--the Blue Sky model--and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during a pandemic.",Ayan Paul; Jayanta Kumar Bhattacharjee; Aksay Pal; Sagar Chakraborty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250750,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250750,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
195,Discovery of re-purposed drugs that slow SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused the death of over 2 million people worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst effective vaccines have been developed and vaccination schedules are being rolled out, the identification of safe and inexpensive drugs to slow the replication of SARS-CoV-2 could help thousands of people worldwide whilst awaiting vaccination.

MethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 tagged with nano-luciferase (SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc) we screened a variety of cells under optimised cell culture conditions for their ability to be infected by, and support the replication of, SARS-CoV-2. Electron microscopy was used to demonstrate generation of infectious virus particles. We assessed a library of 1971 FDA-approved drugs for their ability to inhibit or enhance viral replication in Vero (simian kidney cells) but also in the human hepatocyte cell, HUH7. Initial hits were further tested to identify compounds that could suppress viral replication, post-viral infection. Dose response curves were obtained for a shortlist of 9 compounds of interest (COI).

FindingsOur SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc virus was as effective as wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in inducing CPE and replicating in Vero cells. Conventional electron microscopy showed the NLuc-tagged virus to be structurally indistinguishable from the wild-type virus, and both could be identified within the endosomal system of infected cells. SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc was used in experiments to robustly quantitate virus infection and replication. A wide variety of human cells including lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells were susceptible to infection but were not effective in supporting SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc replication. In contrast, human kidney epithelial cells and human hepatic cells were particularly susceptible and supported SARS-CoV-2-replication, which is in-line with reported proteinuria and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. Our screening of FDA approved compounds identified 35 COI that inhibited virus infection and replication in either Vero or human cell lines. Nine of these also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication when treatment commenced after virus infection. Therapeutics approved for treatment of cancer, malaria, hypertension and viral infection were identified with atovaquone, manidipine, vitamin D3 and ebastine being well tolerated with minimal side effects. Only two COI were consistently found to enhance SARS-CoV-2 replication, aliskiren and lithocholic acid.

InterpretationRe-purposing of safe, well-tolerated FDA-approved drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication is an attractive strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection prior to receiving an effective vaccine. The COI identified here hold potential to contain COVID-19 whilst wide-scale vaccination proceeds. The identification of FDA-approved drugs that enhance SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells suggests that entry routes into cells can be made more accessible to the virus by certain medications.

196,"Expression of human ACE2 N-terminal domain, part of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in fusion with maltose binding protein, E. coli ribonuclease I and human RNase A","The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome contains a positive-strand single-stranded RNA of ~30 kb. Human ACE2 protein is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus attachment and initiation of infection. We propose to use ribonucleases (RNases) as antiviral agents to destroy the viral genome in vitro. In the virions the RNA is protected by viral capsid proteins, membrane proteins and nucleocapsid proteins. To overcome this protection we set out to construct RNase fusion with human ACE2 receptor N-terminal domain (ACE2NTD). We constructed six proteins expressed in E. coli cells: 1) MBP-ACE2NTD, 2) ACE2NTD-GFP, 3) RNase I (6xHis), 4) RNase III (6xHis), 5) RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis), and 6) human RNase A-ACE2NTD150 (6xHis). We evaluated fusion expression in different E. coli strains, partially purified MBP-ACE2NTD protein from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysate, and refolded MBP-ACE2NTD protein from inclusion body. The engineered RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) and hRNase A-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusions are active in cleaving COVID-19 RNA in vitro. The recombinant RNase I (6xHis) and RNase III (6xHis) are active in cleaving RNA and dsRNA in test tube. This study provides a proof-of-concept for construction of fusion protein between human cell receptor and nuclease that may be used to degrade viral nucleic acids in our environment.

197,Mn2+ coordinates Cap-0-RNA to align substrates for efficient 2'-O-methyl transfer by SARS-CoV-2 nsp16,"Capping viral messenger RNAs is essential for efficient translation and prevents their detection by host innate immune responses. For SARS-CoV-2, RNA capping includes 2'-O-methylation of the first ribonucleotide by methyltransferase nsp16 in complex with activator nsp10. The reaction requires substrates, a short RNA and SAM, and is catalyzed by divalent cations, with preference for Mn2+. Crystal structures of nsp16-nsp10 with capped RNAs revealed a critical role of metal ions in stabilizing interactions between ribonucleotides and nsp16, resulting in precise alignment of the substrates for methyl transfer. An aspartate residue that is highly conserved among coronaviruses alters the backbone conformation of the capped RNA in the binding groove. This aspartate is absent in mammalian methyltransferases and is a promising site for designing coronavirus-specific inhibitors.",George Minasov; Monica Rosas-Lemus; Ludmilla Shuvalova; Nicole L.

198,Identification of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) oxysterol derivatives in vitro,"Development of effective antiviral drugs targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oxysterols, defined as oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, include endogenous (naturally occurring) cholesterol metabolites as well as semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives. We have previously studied the use of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives as drug candidates for inhibition of cancer, fibrosis, and bone regeneration. In this study, we have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay. We show that the natural oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells. Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy186 displayed antiviral activity comparable to natural oxysterols. In addition, related oxysterol analogues Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 M and 99% at 15 M, respectively. When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of Oxy210 fall into a therapeutically relevant range (19 M), based on the dose-dependent curve for antiviral activity in our cell culture infection assay. Mechanistic studies suggest that Oxy210 reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 with disrupting the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), intracellular membrane compartments associated with viral replication.

199,Sequential delivery of LAIV and SARS-CoV-2 in the ferret model can reduce SARS-CoV-2 shedding and does not result in enhanced lung pathology.,"Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses could pose unpredictable risks to health systems globally, with recent studies suggesting more severe disease outcomes in co-infected patients. The lack of a readily available COVID-19 vaccine has reinforced the importance of influenza vaccine programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) is an important tool in protecting against influenza, particularly in children. However, it is unknown whether LAIV administration might influence the outcomes of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease. To investigate this, quadrivalent LAIV (QLAIV) was administered to ferrets 3 days pre- or post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. LAIV administration did not exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 disease course or lung pathology with either regimen. Additionally, LAIV administered prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract (URT). We conclude that LAIV administration in close proximity to SARS-CoV-2 infection does not exacerbate mild disease and can reduce SARS-CoV-2 shedding.",Kathryn A Ryan; Katarzyna E Schewe; Jonathan Crowe; Susan A Fotheringham; Yper Hall; Richard Humphreys; Anthony C Marriott; Jemma Paterson; Emma Rayner; Francisco J Salguero; Robert J Watson; Catherine J Whittaker; Miles W Carroll; Oliver Dibben,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429110,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429110,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
200,Nelfinavir markedly improves lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters despite a lack of an antiviral effect,"In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, repurposing of drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections is being explored. The FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir is one of the drugs that has been reported to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV2 replication. We here report on the effect of Nelfinavir in the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Although treatment of infected hamsters with either 15 mg/kg BID or 50 mg/kg BID Nelfinavir [for four consecutive days, initiated on the day of infection] did not reduce viral RNA loads nor infectious virus titres in the lungs (as compared to the vehicle control at the end of treatment) the drug markedly improved virus-induced lung pathology at doses that were well tolerated. Yet, a massive interstitial infiltration of neutrophils was observed in the lungs of treated (infected and uninfected) animals. The protective effect of Nelfinavir on SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology that is unrelated to an antiviral effect warrants further exploration in the context of the treatment of COVID-19.",Caroline S.

201,Environmentally-induced mdig is a major contributor to the severity of COVID-19 through fostering expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor NRPs and glycan metabolism,"The novel {beta}-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 101 million people and resulted in 2.2 million death worldwide. Recent epidemiological studies suggested that some environmental factors, such as air pollution, might be the important contributors to the mortality of COVID-19. However, how environmental exposure enhances the severity of COVID-19 remains to be fully understood. In the present report, we provide evidence showing that mdig, a previously reported environmentally-induced oncogene that antagonizes repressive trimethylation of histone proteins, is a master regulator for SARS-CoV-2 receptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, cathepsins, glycan metabolism and inflammation, key determinants for viral infection and cytokine storm of the patients. Depletion of mdig in bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing resulted in a decreased expression of NRP1, NRP2, cathepsins, and genes involved in protein glycosylation and inflammation, largely due to a substantial enrichment of lysine 9 and/or lysine 27 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) on these genes as determined by ChIP-seq. These data, accordingly, suggest that mdig is a key mediator for the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure and targeting mdig may be one of the effective strategies in ameliorating the symptom and reducing the mortality of COVID-19.",Fei Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.429010,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.429010,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
202,Identification of a conserved neutralizing epitope present on spike proteins from highly pathogenic coronaviruses,"Three pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged, with SARS-CoV-2 causing a global pandemic. While therapeutic antibodies targeting the SARS-2 spike currently focus on the poorly conserved receptor-binding domain, targeting essential neutralizing epitopes on the more conserved S2 domain may provide broader protection. We report three antibodies, binding epitopes conserved on the pre-fusion MERS, SARS-1 and SARS-2 spike S2 domains. Antibody 3A3 binds a conformational epitope with ~2.5 nM affinity and neutralizes in in vitro SARS-2 cell fusion and pseudovirus assays. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry identified residues 980-1006 in the flexible hinge region at the S2 apex as the 3A3 epitope, consistent with binding to natural and engineered spike variants. This location at the spike trimer interface suggests 3A3 prevents the S2 conformational rearrangements required for virus-host cell fusion. This work defines a highly conserved vulnerable site on the SARS-2 S2 domain and may help guide the design of pan-protective spike immunogens.

203,Nanotraps for the containment and clearance of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through its viral spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cells. Here we show functionalized nanoparticles, termed ""Nanotraps"", completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 of host cells. The liposomal-based Nanotrap surfaces were functionalized with either recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and phagocytosis-specific phosphatidylserines. The Nanotraps effectively captured SARS-CoV-2 and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection to ACE2-expressing human cell lines and primary lung cells; the phosphatidylserine triggered subsequent phagocytosis of the virus-bound, biodegradable Nanotraps by macrophages, leading to the clearance of pseudotyped and authentic virus in vitro. Furthermore, the Nanotraps demonstrated excellent biosafety profile in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the Nanotraps inhibited pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in live human lungs in an ex vivo lung perfusion system. In summary, Nanotraps represent a new nanomedicine for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Progress and PotentialTo address the global challenge of creating treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we devised a nanomedicine termed ""Nanotraps"" that can completely capture and eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Nanotraps integrate protein engineering, immunology, and nanotechnology and are effective, biocompatible, safe, stable, feasible for mass production. The Nanotraps have the potential to be formulated into a nasal spray or inhaler for easy administration and direct delivery to the respiratory system, or as an oral or ocular liquid, or subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection to target different sites of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, thus offering flexibility in administration and treatment. More broadly, the highly versatile Nanotrap platform could be further developed into new vaccines and therapeutics against a broad range of diseases in infection, autoimmunity and cancer, by incorporating with different small molecule drugs, RNA, DNA, peptides, recombinant proteins, and antibodies.",Min Chen; Jillian Rosenberg; Xiaolei Cai; Andy Chao Hsuan Lee; Jiuyun Shi; Mindy Nguyen; Thirushan Wignakumar; Vikranth Mirle; Arianna Joy Edobor; John Fung; Jessica Scott Donington; Kumaran Shanmugarajah; Eugene  B.

204,Enhanced immunogenicity of a synthetic DNA vaccine expressing consensus SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using needle-free immunization,"The ongoing global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for an urgent development of effective and safe prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 g of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 g or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of needle-free system could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.",Saswan S Alamri; Khalid A Alluhaybi; Rowa Y Alhabbab; Abdullah Algaissi; Sarah Almahboub; Mohamed A Alfaleh; Turki S Abujamel; Wesam Abdulaal; M-Zaki ElAssouli; Rahaf Alharbi; Mazen Hassanain; Anwar M Hashem,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429219,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429219,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
205,In vitro inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with 0.5% povidone iodine nasal spray (Nasodine) at clinically relevant concentrations and timeframes using tissue culture and PCR based assays,"BACKGROUNDThere has been considerable speculation regarding the potential of PVP-I nasal disinfection as an adjunct to other countermeasures during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Nasodine is a commercial formulation of 0.5% PVP-I that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy in human trials as a treatment for the common cold, including a Phase III trial (ANZCTR: ACTRN12619000764134). This study presents the first report of the in vitro efficacy of this formulation against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODSWe conducted in vitro experiments to determine if the PVP-I formulation inactivated SARS-CoV-2 using two independent assays and virus isolates, and incorporating both PCR-based detection and cell culture methods to assess residual virus after exposure to the formulation.

RESULTSBased on cell culture results, the PVP-I formulation was found to rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 isolates in vitro in short timeframes (15 seconds to 15 minutes) consistent with the minimum and maximum potential residence time in the nose. The Nasodine formula was found to be more effective than 0.5% PVP-I in saline. Importantly, it was found that the formulation inactivated culturable virus but had no effect on PCR-detectable viral RNA.

CONCLUSIONSThe PVP-I formulation eliminated the viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus with short exposure times consistent with nasal use. PCR alone may not be adequate for viral quantification in nasal PVP-I studies; future studies should incorporate cell culture to assess viral viability. Nasal disinfection with PVP-I may be a useful intervention for newly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients to reduce transmission risk and disease progression to the lower respiratory tract.",Simon P Tucker; Stephen Goodall; Peter Molloy; Justin Julander; Michelle Mendenhall; Peter Friedland,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.426979,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.426979,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
206,Host PDZ-containing proteins targeted by SARS-Cov-2,"Small linear motif targeting protein interacting domains called PDZ have been identified at the C-terminus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins E, 3a, and N. Using a high-throughput approach of affinity-profiling against the full human PDZome, we identified sixteen human PDZ binders of SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3A and N showing significant interactions with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 M to 82 M. Six of them (TJP1, PTPN13, HTRA1, PARD3, MLLT4, LNX2) are also recognized by SARS-CoV while three (NHERF1, MAST2, RADIL) are specific to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Most of these SARS-CoV-2 protein partners are involved in cellular junctions/polarity and could be also linked to evasion mechanisms of the immune responses during viral infection. Seven of the PDZ-containing proteins among binders of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3a or N affect significantly viral replication under knock-down gene expression in infected cells. This PDZ profiling identifying human proteins potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 can help to understand the multifactorial severity of COVID19 and to conceive effective anti-coronaviral agents for therapeutic purposes.",Celia Caillet-Saguy; Fabien Durbesson; Veronica V.

208,Prediction Models for Severe Manifestations and Mortality due to COVID-19: A Rapid Systematic Review,"BackgroundThroughout 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a threat to public health on national and global level. There has been an immediate need for research to understand the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that can help predict deterioration including mechanical ventilation, organ support, and death. Studies thus far have addressed the epidemiology of the disease, common presentations, and susceptibility to acquisition and transmission of the virus; however, an accurate prognostic model for severe manifestations of COVID-19 is still needed because of the limited healthcare resources available.

ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to evaluate published reports of prediction models for severe illnesses caused COVID-19.

MethodsSearches were developed by the primary author and a medical librarian using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating terms. Comprehensive strategies, including both index and keyword methods, were devised for PubMed and EMBASE. The data of confirmed COVID-19 patients from randomized control studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies published between January 2020 and July 2020 were retrieved. Studies were independently assessed for risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We collected study type, setting, sample size, type of validation, and outcome including intubation, ventilation, any other type of organ support, or death. The combination of the prediction model, scoring system, performance of predictive models, and geographic locations were summarized.

ResultsA primary review found 292 articles relevant based on title and abstract. After further review, 246 were excluded based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forty-six articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Inter observer agreement on inclusion was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.79 - 0.93). When the PROBAST tool was applied, 44 of the 46 articles were identified to have high or unclear risk of bias, or high or unclear concern for applicability. Two studied reported prediction models, 4C Mortality Score from hospital data and QCOVID from general public data from UK, and were rated as low risk of bias and low concerns for applicability.

ConclusionSeveral prognostic models are reported in the literature, but many of them had concerning risks of biases and applicability. For most of the studies, caution is needed before use, as many of them will require external validation before dissemination. However, two articles were found to have low risk of bias and low applicability can be useful tools.",Jamie Miller; Masafumi Tada; Michihiko Goto; Nicholas M Mohr; Sangil Lee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250718,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250718,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
209,The mobility gap: estimating mobility levels required to control Canada's winter COVID-19 surge,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions remain a primary means of suppressing COVID-19 until vaccination coverage is sufficient to achieve herd immunity. We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures in seven Canadian provinces to quantify the mobility level needed to suppress COVID-19 (mobility threshold), and the difference relative to current mobility levels (mobility gap).

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal study of weekly COVID-19 incidence from March 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021, among provinces with 20 COVID-19 cases in at least 10 weeks. The outcome was weekly growth rate defined as the ratio of current cases compared to the previous week. We examined the effects of average time spent outside the home (non-residential mobility) in the prior three weeks using a lognormal regression model accounting for province, season, and mean temperature. We calculated the COVID-19 mobility threshold and gap.

ResultsAcross the 44-week study period, a total of 704,294 persons were infected with COVID-19. Non-residential mobility dropped rapidly in the spring and reached a median of 36% (IQR: 31,40) in April 2020. After adjustment, each 5% increase in non-residential mobility was associated with a 9% increase in the COVID-19 weekly growth rate (ratio=1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12). The mobility gap increased through the fall months, which was associated with increasing case growth.

InterpretationMobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control COVID-19 through winter 2021.

210,Uncovering Survivorship Bias in Longitudinal Mental Health Surveys,"To our knowledge, survivorship bias in longitudinal mental health survey studies has not been systematically assessed. We therefore assessed potential survivorship bias among 4,039 respondents invited to complete multiple surveys in 2020 for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. Demographic differences in follow-up survey participation included lower retention of younger adults. Adjusting for demographics, individuals who completed only one or two out of four surveys had higher prevalences of anxiety and depression symptoms in April 2020 (e.g., one-survey versus four-survey, anxiety symptoms, aPR=1.30, 95%CI=1.08-1.55, P=0.0045; depression symptoms, aPR=1.43, 95%CI=1.17-1.75, P=0.0005). Among respondents who completed April-2020 and May-2020 surveys, individuals who experienced incident anxiety or depression symptoms significantly higher odds of lower participation in subsequent follow-up surveys (aOR=1.68, 95%CI=1.49-2.48, aOR=1.56, 95%CI=1.15-2.12, respectively, both P<0.005).

211,Hot days and Covid19 - unusual heat stress for nursing professions in Germany,"ObjectivesOur aim was to identify whether working during hot days alongside with Covid-19 related personal protective equipment causes heat stress for nursing professionals in Germany.

MethodsUsing an online survey, we assessed the impact of hot weather on nursing staff performing in personal protective equipment. A random selection of nursing staff from hospitals, nursing homes and outpatient care participated in the survey.

ResultsOut of 428 participants, 6.3% were between 16 and 25 years old, 22.8% between 26 and 35 years, 21.9% between 36 and 45 years, 30.5% between 45 and 55 years, 18.2% between 56 and 65 years, and 0.3% were older than 65 years. Out of all participants, 18.2% were male and 82.5% female. The results of the survey showed that 48.3% had more than 20 years of experience in nursing and 46.2% cardiac, pulmonary, or other pre-existing conditions. Work was found exhaustive while working in PPE by 96.5% of the participants, and 93% complained of worse breathing. We found out that 85.8% reported difficulties to focus. Many workplaces turned out to lack adequate heat protection, with distinct differences concerning the amount of prophylactic and heat mitigating measures across institutions.

ConclusionsOur results clearly show that employers must make more of an effort to provide adequate heat protection for their nursing staff. In order to secure the public health care, there is a need for action, especially in the case of previous conditions of caregivers.

What is already known about this subject?{blacktriangleright} Working in personal protective equipment is often needed during pandemics, to protect nurses, doctors and staff from an infection.
{blacktriangleright}However, the equipment can also hamper efficiency and productivity of healthcare workers and lead to personal discomfort, for example, during heat waves.


What are the new findings?{blacktriangleright} According to our study, nurses and nursing assistants in Germany are often older than 45 years and, in many cases, suffer from pre-existing conditions, which exacerbate the problems with personal protective equipment during periods of hot temperatures.
{blacktriangleright}Many healthcare institutions do not offer adequate ways to mitigate heat stress for their staff.

213,Socioeconomic Disparities and COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance: Experience from Israel,"COVID-19 vaccination acceptance has a key role in mitigating the pandemic. Concern has been raised that vaccination rates will be limited in demographically defined areas of lower income. Israels rapid vaccination campaign may allow to assess these assumptions in real-world and to devise tools for effectively focusing the vaccination efforts. We analyzed the correlation between COVID-19 vaccination rates, socioeconomic status (SES) and active COVID-19 disease burden. We carried out a nationwide study, based on data provided by Ministry of Health of COVID-19 vaccination rates in all municipalities in Israel up to January 12th, 2021. Municipal Vaccination rates of population older than 60 significantly correlated with the socioeconomic status (r=0.83, 95% confidence interval [0.79 to 0.87]). Finally, we established a novel metric for focusing the vaccination efforts based on % vaccinations and active disease burden. In Israel, a case-model country for COVD-19 vaccinations, vaccination rates were strongly correlated with SES.

The development of the humoral response to the virus has been the subject of intensive research and development. A flow cytometry-based assay using native full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expressed in 293T cells was recently proposed as a complementary seropositivity determination assay.

The aim of our study was to further develop the flow cytometry assay for potential use as a confirmatory test and to standardize its parameters and results for reliable inter-laboratory use. We have optimized the protocol, established the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and tested reproducibility using pre-COVID plasma samples and convalescent, SARS-CoV-2 individual plasma samples.

The flow-based assay was simplified and standardized by cultivating the 293T cells in suspension and expressing results in Mean Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF) using an internal antibody positive control. The ROC curve was determined with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and the assay specificity and sensitivity were established at 100% and 97.7% respectively. Reproducibility was good as determined on multiple cytometers, on different days, and with data acquisition as far as 72h post-staining. The optimized and standardized assay could be used as a high throughput confirmation confirmatory assay in flow cytometry laboratories involved in serological testing.",Carl Simard; Jonathan Richard; Renee Bazin; Andres Finzi; Patrick Trepanier,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250770,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250770,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
215,Vaccination strategies for minimizing loss of life in Covid-19 in a Europe lacking vaccines,"Aim and Background: We aimed at identifying vaccination strategies that minimize loss of life in the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 mainly kills the elderly, but the pandemic is driven by social contacts that are more frequent in the young. Vaccines elicit stronger immune responses per dose in younger persons. As vaccine production is a bottleneck, many countries have adopted a strategy of first vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable, while postponing vaccination of the young. Methods: Based on published age-stratified immunogenicity data of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, we compared the established 'one dose fits all' approach with tailored strategies: The known differential immunogenicity of vaccine doses in different age groups is exploited to vaccinate the elderly at full dose, while the young receive a reduced dose, amplifying the number of individuals receiving the vaccine early. A modeling approach at European Union scale with population structure, Covid-19 case and death rates similar to Europe in late January 2021 is used. Results: When the elderly were vaccinated preferentially, the pandemic initially continued essentially unchecked, as it was dominantly driven by social contacts in other age groups. Tailored strategies, including regular dosing in the elderly but reduced dose vaccination in the young, multiplied early vaccination counts, and even with some loss in protection degree for the individual person, the protective effect towards stopping the pandemic and protecting lives was enhanced, even for the elderly. In the European Union, pandemic duration (threshold >100'000 cases/day) was shortened from 53 to 18-24 days; cumulative death count over 100 days was reduced by >30'000. Conclusion: Protecting the vulnerable, minimizing overall deaths and stopping the pandemic is best achieved by an adaptive vaccination strategy using an age-tailored vaccine dose.",Patrick Hunziker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250747,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250747,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
216,Early Multidrug Outpatient Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19) and Reduced Mortality Among Nursing Home Residents,"The outbreak of COVID-19 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world with tremendous morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found multidrug regimens relying on the use of hydroxychloroquine as well as other agents including doxycycline were associated with a statistically significant and >60% reductions in mortality. Going forward, we theorize and based on the evidence, that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients) has a genuine probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus that will prevent the development and/or worsening of problems associated with COVID-19, most particularly isolation, hospitalization, and death. In fact, with the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of patients with acute COVID-19 is possibly the most rational and importantly feasible strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If the approach remains  wait-and-see and elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. We put forth the notion that the most important factor in this regard, is making available early therapeutic intervention as described here. These drugs include and under supervision by skilled doctors, combination/sequenced ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, bromhexine hydrochloride, and favipiravir (outside the US), along with inhaled steroids such as budesonide and oral steroids including dexamethasone and prednisone, and anti-thrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as heparin). As the clinical trials data on treatments for COVID-19 mature, this early treatment therapeutic option deserves serious, urgent, and sober consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers.",Paul E Alexander; Robin Armstrong; George Fareed; Kulvinder Gill; John Lotus; Ramin Oskoui; Chad Podromomos; Harvey Risch; Howard Tenenbaum; Craig M Wax; Peter A McCullough,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250706,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250706,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
217,Administration of tocilizumab to patients with high concentrations of IL-6 in the course of COVID-19 is associated with a better prognosis,"BackgroundDespite the direct viral activity, the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) includes an overproduction of cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Therefore tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors, became considered as a possible therapeutic option.

MethodsPatients were selected from the SARSTer national database, which included 2332 individuals with COVID-19 and the current study included 825 adult patients with moderate to severe course. The retrospective analysis was performed in 170 patients treated with TCZ and 655 without this medication or any other anti-cytokine therapy. The end-points of treatment effectiveness were a rate of death, need for mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement.

ResultsPatients treated with TCZ were balanced compared to non-TCZ regarding gender, age, BMI, and prevalence of coexisting conditions. The reduced death rate was demonstrated in patients treated with TCZ and baseline IL-6 >100 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.10-0.78), or those needing oxygen supplementations who worsened within 7 days of hospitalization (HR: 0.38, 95% CI:0.16-0.88). The best effectiveness of TCZ was achieved in patients with a combination of baseline IL-6>100 pg/ml and either SpO2[&le;]90% (HR for death, mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement after 21 or 28 days: 0.07, 0.14, 5.53, 5.18 respectively) or requiring oxygen supplementation (HR for death and clinical improvement after 21 or 28 days, 0.18, 2.66, 2.85 respectively).

ConclusionsTocilizumab administered for COVID-19 in patients with a baseline concentration of IL-6>100 pg/ml is associated with reduced mortality and faster clinical improvement, particularly if there is a need for oxygen supplementation due to SpO2[&le;]90%.",Robert Flisiak; Jerzy Jaroszewicz; Magdalena Rogalska; Tadeusz Lapinski; Aleksandra Berkan-Kawinska; Beata Bolewska; Magdalena Tudrujek-Zdunek; Dorota Kozielewicz; Marta Rorat; Piotr Leszczynski; Krzysztof Klos; Justyna Kowalska; Pawel Pabjan; Anna Piekarska; Iwona Mozer-Lisewska; Krzysztof Tomasiewicz; Malgorzata Pawlowska; Krzysztof Simon; Joanna Polanska; Dorota Zarebska-Michaluk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21249932,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21249932,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
218,Modeling the potential impact of indirect transmission on COVID-19 epidemic,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 through direct transmission (person-to-person) has been the focus of most studies on the dynamics of COVID-19. The efficacy of social distancing and mask usage at reducing the risk of direct transmission of COVID-19 has been studied by many researchers. Little or no attention is given to indirect transmission of the virus through shared items, commonly touch surfaces and door handles. The impact of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and in the environment, on the dynamics of COVID-19 remain largely unknown. Also, the current increase in the number of cases despite the strict non-pharmaceutical interventions suggests a need to study the indirect transmission of COVID-19 while incorporating testing of infected individuals as a preventive measure. Assessing the impact of indirect transmission of the virus may improve our understanding of the overall dynamics of COVID-19. We developed a novel deterministic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-virus-death compartmental model to study the impact of indirect transmission pathway on the spread of COVID-19, the sources of infection, and prevention/control. We fitted the model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases at episode date in Toronto, Canada using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization algorithm. We studied the effect of indirect transmission on the epidemic peak, peak time, epidemic final size and the effective reproduction number, based on different initial conditions and at different stages. Our findings revealed an increase in cases with indirect transmission. Our work highlights the importance of implementing additional preventive and control measures involving cleaning of surfaces, fumigation, and disinfection to lower the spread of COVID-19, especially in public areas like the grocery stores, malls and so on. We conclude that indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has a significant effect on the dynamics of COVID-19, and there is need to consider this transmission route for effective mitigation, prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.",Jummy Funke David; Sarafa Adewale Iyaniwura; Pei Yuan; Yi Tan; Jude Dzevela Kong; Huaiping Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.20181040,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.20181040,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
219,Viral sequencing reveals US healthcare personnel rarely become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through patient contact,"BackgroundHealthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2019 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used at this institution to protect HCP from healthcare-associated transmission.

MethodsIn this retrospective case series, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combined viral sequence data and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection.

FindingsWe investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible patient contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality standards and were used for downstream analysis. We found the majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We found a smaller percentage could be traced to a coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%).

InterpretationInfection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn 16 January 2021 we searched for ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""healthcare workers"" AND ""viral sequencing"" in Google Scholar. This search returned 57 results, and included a number of preprint articles. We found two studies that used viral sequencing to investigate healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Netherlands 1 and the United Kingdom 2. To our knowledge, no study has used viral sequencing to specifically investigate the source of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare workers in the United States. Although we and others have written about the potential utility of sequencing as an infection control asset 3-6, few have demonstrated the practical application of such efforts.

Added value of this studyOur study suggests infection control measures in place at the institution evaluated in this case series are largely protecting healthcare personnel (HCP) from healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections. Even so, the majority of healthcare-associated infections we did identify appeared to be linked to HCP-to-HCP spread so additional messaging and guidelines to reduce HCP-to-HCP spread in and out of the workplace may be warranted. In addition, we demonstrated how rapid viral sequencing can be combined with, even limited, epidemiological information to reconstruct healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Implications of all the available evidenceHealthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections negatively affect HCP, patients, and communities. Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients and other HCP at risk. We found the majority of HCP infections appeared to be acquired through community exposure so measures to reduce community spread are critical.

220,Comparative performance of multiplex salivary and commercially available serologic assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralization titers,"Oral fluid (hereafter saliva) offers a non-invasive sampling method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, data comparing performance of salivary tests against commercially-available serologic and neutralizing antibody (nAb) assays are lacking. This study compared the performance of a multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay targeting antibodies to nucleocapsid (N), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) antigens to three commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 serology enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, and BioRad) and nAb. Paired saliva and plasma samples were collected from 101 eligible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors >14 days since PCR+ confirmed diagnosis. Concordance was evaluated using positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement, overall percent agreement (PA), and Cohens kappa coefficient. The range between salivary and plasma EIAs for SARS-CoV-2-specific N was PPA: 54.4-92.1% and NPA: 69.2-91.7%, for RBD was PPA: 89.9-100% and NPA: 50.0-84.6%, and for S was PPA: 50.6-96.6% and NPA: 50.0-100%. Compared to a plasma nAb assay, the multiplex salivary assay PPA ranged from 62.3% (N) and 98.6% (RBD) and NPA ranged from 18.8% (RBD) to 96.9% (S). Combinations of N, RBD, and S and a summary algorithmic index of all three (N/RBD/S) in saliva produced ranges of PPA: 87.6-98.9% and NPA: 50-91.7% with the three EIAs and ranges of PPA: 88.4-98.6% and NPA: 21.9-34.4% with the nAb assay. A multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay demonstrated comparable performance to three commercially-available plasma EIAs and a nAb assay, and may be a viable alternative to assist in screening CCP donors and monitoring population-based seroprevalence and vaccine antibody response.",Christopher D Heaney; Nora Pisanic; Pranay R Randad; Kate Kruczynski; Tyrone Howard; Xianming Zhu; Kirsten Littlefield; Eshan Patel; Ruchee Shrestha; Oliver Laeyendecker; Shmuel Shoham; David J Sullivan; Kelly Gebo; Daniel Hanley; Andrew Redd; Thomas Quinn; Arturo Casadevall; Jonathan M Zenilman; Andrew Pekosz; Evan M Bloch; Aaron AR Tobian,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250717,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250717,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
221,Significance of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibody Testing during COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation,"ObjectiveTo assess the value of using SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody testing to prioritize the vaccination of susceptible individuals as part of a COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan when vaccine supply is limited.

MethodsA compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths.

ResultsThe use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed and moves closer to the peak day.

ConclusionsAntibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available.",Akane B Fujimoto; Inci Yildirim; Pinar Keskinocak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250721,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250721,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
222,Targeting TGF-b pathway with COVID-19 Drug Candidate ARTIVeda/PulmoHeal Accelerates Recovery from Mild-Moderate COVID-19,"Our COVID-19 drug candidate ARTIVeda/PulmoHeal is a novel gelatin capsule formulation of the Artemisia extract Ayurveda for oral delivery of TGF-{beta} targeting anti-malaria phytomedicine Artemisinin with documented anti-inflammatory and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here we report the safety and efficacy of ARTIVeda in adult COVID-19 patients with symptomatic mild-moderate COVID-19, who were treated in a randomized, open-label Phase IV study in Bangalore, Karnataka, India (Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/09/028044). ARTIVeda showed a very favorable safety profile, and the only ARTIVeda-related adverse events were transient mild rash and mild hypertension. Notably, ARTIVeda, when added to the SOC, accelerated the recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. While all patients were symptomatic at baseline (WHO score = 2-4), 31 of 39 (79.5%) of patients treated with ARTIVeda plus SOC became asymptomatic (WHO score = 1) by the end of the 5-day therapy, including 10 of 10 patients with severe dry cough 7 of 7 patients with severe fever. By comparison, 12 of 21 control patients (57.1%) treated with SOC alone became asymptomatic on day 5 (P=0.028, Fishers exact test). This clinical benefit was particularly evident when the treatment outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (WHO score = 4) treated with SOC alone versus SOC plus ARTIVeda were compared. The median time to becoming asymptomatic was only 5 days for the SOC plus ARTIVeda group (N=18) but 14 days for the SOC alone group (N=10) (P=0.004, Log-rank test).

223,Age significantly influences the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody assays,"BACKGROUNDPoint of care serological assays are a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnostics but do have limitations. This study evaluated the sensitivity of five rapid antibody assays and explored factors influencing their sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies.

METHODSFinger-prick blood samples from 102 participants, within two to six weeks of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, were tested for IgG and IgM on five rapid serological assays. The assay sensitivities were compared, and patient factors evaluated in order to investigate potential associations with assay sensitivity.

RESULTSSensitivity ranged from 36% to 69% for IgG and 13% to 67% for IgM. Age was the only factor significantly influencing the likelihood of a detectable IgG or IgM response. Individuals aged 40 years and older had an increased likelihood of a detectable IgG or IgM antibody response by rapid antibody assay.

225,Resource Allocation for Different Types of Vaccines against COVID-19: Tradeoffs and Synergies between Efficacy and Reach,"ObjectiveDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple vaccine candidates were developed in record time. The primary decision for a vaccine-ordering decision-maker then becomes how to allocate limited resources between different types of vaccines. One may expect that available resources should be favored towards a vaccine with high efficacy if it can be distributed as widely as any other vaccine. However, if a high efficacy vaccine consumes more resources than a vaccine with lower efficacy due to distributional challenges, the decision is no longer trivial as a widespread vaccination is necessary to reach herd immunity.

MethodsWe adapt a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIR-D) model with vaccination and simulate the level of infection attack rate (IAR) under different resource consumption ratios between two vaccine types with different resource allocation decisions.

ResultsWe find that when there are limited resources, allocating resources entirely to a vaccine with high efficacy that becomes available earlier than a vaccine with lower efficacy that becomes available later does not always lead to a lower IAR, particularly if the former can immunize less than a range of 5.9% to 6.4% of the population (with the selected study parameters) before the latter becomes available. Sensitivity analyses show that this result stays robust under different efficacy levels for the higher efficacy vaccine.

ConclusionsOur results show that the reach of a vaccine to be distributed widely under limited resources is a key factor to achieve low IAR levels, even though the vaccine may be of higher efficacy and may become available earlier than others. Manufacturing a novel vaccine lacking a fully developed suitable infrastructure for its effective distribution and storage may impact the potential benefits of the immunization program. Understanding the tradeoffs between efficacy and reach is critical for resource allocation decisions between different vaccine types to maximize the improvement in health outcomes.",Daniel Kim; Pelin Pekgun; Inci Yildirim; Pinar Keskinocak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250713,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250713,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
226,PCR assay to enhance global surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may increase transmissibility and/or cause escape from immune responses1-3, there is an urgent need for the targeted surveillance of circulating lineages. It was found that the B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1) variant first detected in the UK4,5 could be serendipitously detected by the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses, spike {Delta}69-70, would cause a ""spike gene target failure"" (SGTF) result. However, a SGTF result is not definitive for B.1.1.7, and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern that lack spike {Delta}69-70, such as B.1.351 (also 501Y.V2) detected in South Africa6 and P.1 (also 501Y.V3) recently detected in Brazil7. We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a {Delta}3675-3677) in all three variants, which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Using ORF1a {Delta}3675-3677 as the primary target and spike {Delta}69-70 to differentiate, we designed and validated an open source PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern8.

227,Differences in detected viral loads guide use of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detection assays towards symptomatic college students and children.,"Limitations in timely testing for SARS-CoV-2 drive the need for new approaches in suspected COVID-19 disease. We queried whether viral load (VL) in the upper airways at presentation could improve the management and diagnosis of patients. This study was conducted in a 9 hospital system in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania between March 1-August 31 2020. Viral load was determined by PCR assays for patients presenting to the Emergency Departments (ED), community pediatrics practices and college health service. We found that for the ED patients, VL did not vary substantially between those admitted and not. VL was relatively equivalent across ages, except for the under 25 age groups that tended to present with higher loads. To determine if rapid antigen testing (RAT) could aid diagnosis in certain populations, we compared BD Veritor and Quidel Sofia to SOC PCR-based tests. The antigen assay provided a disease-detection sensitivity of >90% in a selection of 32 positive students and was modeled to have an 80% sensitivity in all positive students. In the outpatient pediatric population, the antigen assay detected 70% of PCR-positives. Extrapolating these findings to viral loads in older hospitalized patients, a minority would be detected by RAT (40%). Higher loads did correlate with death, though the prognostic value was marginal (ROC AUC of only 0.66). VL did not distinguish between those needing mechanical ventilation and routine inpatients. We conclude that VL in upper airways, while not prognostic for disease management, may aid in selecting proper testing methodologies for certain patient populations.",Juan Luis Gomez Marti; Jamie Gribschaw; Melissa McCullough; Abbie Mallon; Jamie Acero; Amy Kinzler; Jamie Godesky; Kelly Heidenreich; Jennifer Iagnemma; Marian Vanek; A William Pasculle; Tung Phan; Alejandro Hoberman; John V Williams; Stephanie Mitchell; Alan Wells,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250365,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250365,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

Findings were correlated with mortality, cardiac injury and inflammatory markers. Our cohort included 61% males and 77% African Americans. The median age and BMI were 66 years (57-74) and 31 kg/m2 (26.1-39), respectively. We observed atrial arrhythmias in 29% of the patients (17% new onset), First degree heart block in 12%, ST-T segment changes in 17%, S1Q3T3 pattern in 19%, premature ventricular complexes in 23%, premature atrial complexes in 13%, Q waves in 27%, T wave inversion in 42% of the cases. While presence of premature atrial complexes or left atrial abnormality correlated with mortality (P = 0.02 & 0.03, respectively), other findings did not show significant correlation in this small cohort of patients.",Mohamed Shokr; Omar Chehab; Mustafa Ajam; Manmohan Singh; Said Ashraf; John Dawdy; Mohit Pahuja; Vivek Reddy; Ahmed Subahi; M.

229,Application of a 27-protein candidate cardiovascular surrogate endpoint to track risk ascendancy and resolution in COVID-19.,"BackgroundThere is an urgent need for tools allowing the early prognosis and subsequent monitoring of individuals with heterogeneous COVID-19 disease trajectories. Pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease is a leading risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor outcomes, and cardiac involvement is prevalent in COVID-19 patients both during the acute phase as well as in convalescence. The utility of traditional CV risk biomarkers in mild COVID-19 disease or across disease course is poorly understood. We sought to determine if a previously validated 27-protein predictor of CV outcomes served a purpose in COVID-19.

MethodsThe 27-protein test of residual CV (RCV) risk was applied without modification to n=860 plasma samples from hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at disease presentation from three independent cohorts to predict COVID-19 severity and mortality. The same test was applied to an additional n=991 longitudinal samples to assess sensitivity to change in CV risk throughout the course of infection into convalescence.

ResultsIn each independent cohort, RCV predictions were significantly related to maximal subsequent COVID-19 severity and to mortality. At the baseline blood draw, the mean protein-predicted likelihood of an event in subjects who died during the study period ranged from 88-99% while it ranged from 8-36% in subjects who were not admitted to hospital. Additionally, the test outperformed existing risk predictors based on commonly used laboratory chemistry values or presence of comorbidities. Application of the RCV test to sequential samples showed dramatic increases in risk during the first few days of infection followed by risk reduction in the survivors; a period of catastrophically high cardiovascular risk (above 50%) typically lasted 8-12 days and had not resolved to normal levels in most people within that timescale.

ConclusionsThe finding that a 27-protein candidate CV surrogate endpoint developed in multi-morbid patients prior to the pandemic is both prognostic and acutely sensitive to the adverse effects of COVID-19 suggests that this disease activates the same biologic risk-related mechanisms. The test may be useful for monitoring recovery and drug response.",Clare Paterson; Yolanda Hagar; Michael A Hinterberg; Alexander W Charney; Diane M Del Valle; Michael R Filbin; Sacha Gnjatic; Jason D Goldman; Nir Hacohen; James R Heath; Rainer Hillenbrand; Lori L Jennings; Seunghee Kim-Schulze; Andrew T Magis; Miriam Merad; Konstantinos Mouskas; Nicole W Simons; Stephen A Williams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250129,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250129,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
230,High variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households and implications for control,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a high risk of transmission in close-contact indoor settings, which may include households. Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy.

MethodsWe compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior PCR test reporting from members of more than 9000 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population.

ResultsWe estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.38% (95% CI 0.30% - 0.48%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 35% (26% - 47%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 15% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.40 (0.32 - 0.51) to avoid continued growth of the Utah epidemic.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus.",Damon J.A. Toth; Alexander B. Beams; Lindsay T.

231,Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 serology and clinical phenotype amongst hospitalised children in a tertiary children's hospital in India,"IntroductionChildren usually present with minimal or no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have not been well described. We describe the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical phenotype of seropositive children admitted to a tertiary childrens hospital in South India.

MethodsTo determine the seropositivity and describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst hospitalised children, we performed a prospective clinical data collection and blood sampling of children admitted to Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, India over 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In seropositive children, we compared antibody titres between children with and without PIMS-TS.

ResultsOf 463 children, 91 (19.6%) were seropositive. The median (range) age of seropositive children was 5 years (1 month - 17 years). Clinical presentation was consistent with Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) in 48% (44/91) of seropositive children. The median (range) antibody titre was 54.8 (11.1-170.9) AU/ml among all seropositive children. The median antibody titre among the children with PIMS-TS (60.3 AU/mL) was significantly (p=0.01) higher when compared to the children without PIM-TS (54.8 AU/mL).

ConclusionWe describe the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 amongst hospitalised children in a LMIC tertiary childrens hospital. Almost half of the seropositive children had PIMS-TS. Antibody levels may be helpful in the diagnosis and disease stratification of PIMS-TS.

Lay summaryChildren usually present with minimal or no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) has emerged as a distinctive paediatric illness related to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 is being used increasingly as a diagnostic test for PIMS-TS. However, data on the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children is sparse. We therefore, attempted to identify the seropositivity and describe the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst infants and children getting hospitalised in a childrens hospital in south India. Nearly one-fifth of the hospitalised children tested serology positive over 4 months. Antibody levels in children with PIMS-TS were significantly higher in comparison to the other two groups (acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and children without PIMS-TS). Results from our study suggest that all children are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection though they may present with mild illness or no symptoms. We also observed that antibody testing may have a possible role in diagnosis of PIMS-TS.",Aishwarya Venkataraman; Balasubramanian S; Sulochana Putilibai; Lakshan Raj S; Sumanth Amperayani; Senthilnathan S; Anand Manoharan; Arokia Sophi; Amutha R; Kalaimaran Sadasivam; Anu Goenka; Ramanan A V,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250660,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250660,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
232,Increasing but inadequate intention to receive Covid-19 vaccination over the first 50 days of impact of the more infectious variant and roll-out of vaccination in UK: indicators for public health messaging,"ObjectivesTo inform critical public health messaging by determining how changes in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, attitudes to the priorities for administration, the emergence of new variants and availability of vaccines may affect the trajectory and achievement of herd immunity.

Methods>9,000 respondents in an ongoing cross-sectional participatory longitudinal epidemiology study (LoC-19, n=18,581) completed a questionnaire within their personal electronic health record in the week reporting first effective Covid-19 vaccines, and then again after widespread publicity of the increased transmissibility of a new variant (November 13th and December 31st 2020 respectively). Questions covered willingness to receive Covid-19 vaccination and attitudes to prioritisation. Descriptive statistics, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and natural language processing of free-text responses are reported, and how changes over the first 50 days of both vaccination roll-out and new-variant impact modelling of anticipated transmission rates and the likelihood and time to herd immunity.

FindingsCompared with the week reporting the first efficacious vaccine there was a 15% increase in acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination, attributable in one third to the impact of the new variant, with 75% of respondents ""shielding"" - staying at home and not leaving unless essential - regardless of health status or tier rules. 12.5% of respondents plan to change their behaviour two weeks after completing vaccination compared with 45% intending to do so only when cases have reduced to a low level. Despite the increase from 71% to 86% over this critical 50-day period, modelling of planned uptake of vaccination remains below that required for rapid effective herd immunity - now estimated to be 90 percent in the presence of a new variant escalating R0 to levels requiring further lockdowns. To inform the public messaging essential therefore to improve uptake, age and female gender were, respectively, strongly positively and negatively associated with wanting a vaccine. 22.7% disagreed with the prioritisation list, though 70.3% were against being able to expedite vaccination through payment. Teachers (988, 12.6%) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) (837, 10.7%) groups were most cited by respondents for prioritisation.

InterpretationIn this sample, the growing impact of personal choice among the increasingly informed public highlights a decrease in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy over time, with news of a new variant motivating increased willingness for vaccination but at levels below what may be required for effective herd immunity. We identify public preferences for next-in-line priorities, headed by teachers and BAME groups, consideration of which will help build trust and community engagement critical for maximising compliance with not only the vaccination programme but also all other public health measures.",Patrik Bachtiger; Alexander Adamson; William A Maclean; Jennifer K Quint; Nicholas S Peters,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250083,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250083,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
233,Relative humidity predicts day-to-day variations in COVID-19 cases in the city of Buenos Aires,"Possible links between the transmission of COVID-19 and meteorology have been investigated by comparing positive cases across geographical regions. Little is known, however, about the degree to which meteorological conditions drive the daily dynamics of COVID-19 spread at a given location. The main limitation is that individual waves of the disease are typically abrupt and eventful, making correlations somewhat anecdotal. In contrast, we here present a long-term case study for the city of Buenos Aires, which has suffered a single prolonged wave of spread during 2020, with most significant changes in policy and population behavior taking place before the main local outbreak. We found that humidity plays a prominent role in modulating the variation of COVID-19 positive cases through a negative-slope linear relationship, with an optimal lag of 9 days between the meteorological observation and the positive case report. This relationship is specific to winter months, when relative humidity predicts up to half of the variance in positive cases. Our results provide a tool to anticipate local surges in COVID-19 cases after events of low humidity. More generally, they add to accumulating evidence pointing to dry air as an important driver of global COVID-19 transmission.",Andrea L Pineda Rojas; Sandra M Cordo; Ramiro I Saurral; Jose L Jimenez; Linsey C Marr; Emilio Kropff,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250789,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250789,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
234,COVID-19 vaccine uptake among healthcare workers in the fourth country to authorize BNT162b2 during the first month of rollout,"BackgroundThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the fourth country in the world to authorize the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, which it rolled out on December 17, 2020 and first targeted at healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assesses vaccine uptake among this group during the first month of its availability.

MethodsA national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19 vaccine, sources of HCWs information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern, and anxiety level using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake.

ResultsOf the 1,058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%) were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not registered. In a bivariate analysis, not enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those > 40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005), Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, independent factors for not enrolling to receive the vaccine included being female (aOR = 0.287, 95%CI = 0.206-0.401, P < 0.001), being less than 40 years of age (aOR = 1.021, 95%CI = 1.002-1.040, P = 0.032), and using social media as a source of information (aOR = 0.207, 95%CI = 0.132-1.354, P = 0.001). Factors associated with uptake were being a Saudi national (aOR = 1.918, 95%CI = 1.363-2.698, P < 0.001), working in an intensive care unit (aOR = 1.495, 95%CI = 1.083-2.063, P = 0.014), and working at a university hospital (aOR = 1.867, 95%CI = 1.380-2.525, P < 0.001).

ConclusionsA low level of vaccine uptake was observed especially in female HCWs, those younger than 40 years old, and those who used social media as their source of vaccine information. This survey provides important information for public health authorities in order to scale up vaccination campaigns targeting these HCWs to increase vaccine enrollment and uptake.",Mazin Barry; Mohamad-Hani Temsah; Fadi Aljamaan; Basema Saddik; Ayman Al-Eyadhy; Shelaweeh Alanazi; Nurah Alamro; Abdullah Alhuzaimi; Ali Alhaboob; Fahad Alsohime; Ali Alaraj; Rabih Halwani; Amr Jamal; Omar Temsah; Fahad Alzamil; Ali Alsomialy; Jaffar Al-Tawfiq,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250749,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250749,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
235,COVID-19 Prevention Beliefs and Practices in College Students,"BackgroundAs college students in the United States return to university campuses, it is important to understand their beliefs and practices on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention.

PurposeTo assess beliefs and practices regarding COVID-19 prevention among college students in the United States

MethodsAn online, self-administered survey was developed that collected information on COVID-19 preventative practice and beliefs. Survey responses were collected between July 13, 2020 and July 31, 2020.

ResultsA total of 4,834 college students participated in the survey with a response rate of 22.9%. Compared to males, more female college students practiced COVID-19 preventative measures, including always wearing masks or face coverings in public (52% vs. 44%, p<0.001) and always or often observing social distancing (70% vs. 63%, p<0.001). In contrast to students from larger population areas, fewer college students from rural areas reported practicing prevention measures, such as always wearing a mask (24% rural v. 45% towns vs. 55% cities, p<0.001) and always social distancing (20% rural vs. 21% towns vs. 29% cities, p<0.001). Additionally, more students from rural areas have become much less worried about personally contracting COVID-19 over the last 3 months when compared to students from towns and cities (21% vs. 16% vs. 11%, p<0.001). Fewer white college students compared to other racial groups thought it was very important to wear masks (55% white vs. 76% Black vs. 82% Asian vs. 63% American Indian or Alaskan native (AIAN) & Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), p<0.001) and very important to practice social distancing (29% white vs. 50% Black vs. 53% Asian vs. 36% AIAN/NHOPI, p <0.001). Compared to Non-Hispanic students, more Hispanic students thought it was very important to practice preventative measures, including wearing a mask (71% vs. 58%, p<0.001), social distancing (37% vs. 32%, p=0.017), and good hand hygiene (77% vs. 67%, p=0.013).

ConclusionCOVID-19 prevention beliefs and practices differ between sexes, the size of town one lives, race, and ethnicity. In general, female students followed Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 prevention guidelines more closely than male students. Students who reside in areas of larger populations have more strict COVID-19 prevention beliefs and practices than students from areas with smaller populations. Asian and Black/African American students adhered closer to CDC COVID-19 prevention guidelines and had stronger beliefs for infection prevention measures than white or AIAN/NHOPI students.

A novel pilot health surveillance programme to assess the feasibility of weekly mass RT-LAMP testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva samples collected at home was developed and piloted by the University of Southampton and Southampton City Council. Rapid qualitative evaluation was conducted to explore experiences of those who took part in the programme, of those who declined and of those in the educational and healthcare organisations involved in the pilot testing who were responsible for roll-out. This included 77 interviews and 20 focus groups with 223 staff, students, pupils and household members from four schools, one university, and one community healthcare NHS trust. Conversations revealed that high levels of communication, trust and convenience were necessary to ensure peoples engagement with the programme. This suggests community leaders and stakeholder organisations should be involved throughout programme development and implementation to optimise these features of the testing.

237,Ultra-short-wave diathermy shortens the course of moderate and severe COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundCOVID-19 patients have severe lung injury. The USWD could play a supportive role in relieving lung injury and enhance clinical recovery.

Methods and findingsThe design was a single-center, evaluator blinded; 2-arm parallel design superiority randomized controlled clinical trial. Moderate and severe coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients with acute respiratory syndrome, Fifty patients were randomized (USWD, 25; control, 25) between February 18/2020 and April 20/2020. There were male 22 (44.0%) and female 28 (56.0%) with mean (SD) age 53(10.69). Time to clinical recovery (USWD 36.84 vs control 43.56, P = 0.03) was significantly shortened with a between-group difference of 6.72 days. The median SIRS score at day 28 was 0 (0-1) in the USWD group, while 0 (0-2) in the control group (P = 0.011), and the seven-point scale at day 28 showed significant improvement in the USWD group (P = 0.003). While the rate of RNA negative conversion at day 7 (2/25 vs 7/25, p=0.054), day 14 (14/25 vs 18/25 p=0.239), day 21 (22/25 vs 18/25 p=0.279), and day 28 (25/25 vs 22/25 p=0.730) did not show statistical significance. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the AI-assisted CT analysis. No treatment-associated adverse events or worsening of pulmonary fibrosis were found.

ConclusionsAmong the 50 moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, the USWD as an adjunctive therapy to standard therapy could shorten the recovery course and enhance clinical improvement without aggravating pulmonary fibrosis. However, the study did not report statistical significance in the negative conversion rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid due to the small sample size and early termination, the findings of this study are limited.

238,Updated SARS-CoV-2 Single Nucleotide Variants and Mortality Association,"Since its outbreak in December 2019, COVID-19 has caused 100,5844,555 cases and 2,167,313 deaths as of Jan 27, 2021. Comparing our previous study of SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) before June 2020, we found out that the SNV clustering had changed considerably since June 2020. Apart from that the group SNVs represented by two non-synonymous mutations A23403G (S: D614G) and C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L) became dominant and carried by over 95% genomes, a few emerging groups of SNVs were recognized with sharply increased monthly occurrence ratios up to 70% in November 2020. Further investigation revealed that several SNVs were strongly associated with the mortality, but they presented distinct distribution in specific countries, e.g., Brazil, USA, Saudi Arabia, India, and Italy. SNVs including G25088T, T25A, G29861T and G29864A were adopted in a regularized logistic regression model to predict the mortality status in Brazil with the AUC of 0.84. Protein structure analysis showed that the emerging subgroups of non-synonymous SNVs and those mortality-related ones in Brazil were located on protein surface area. The clashes in protein structure introduced by these mutations might in turn affect virus pathogenesis through conformation changes, leading to the difference in transmission and virulence. Particularly, we found that SNVs tended to occur in intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs) of Spike (S) and ORF1ab, suggesting a critical role of SNVs in protein IDRs to determine protein folding and immune evasion.",Shuyi Fang; Sheng Liu; Jikui Shen; Alex Z Lu; Yucheng Zhang; Kailing Li; Juli Liu; Lei Yang; Chang-Deng Hu; Jun Wan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250757,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250757,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

240,Discontinuation of isolation for persons with COVID-19: Is 10 days really safe?,"BackgroundThe detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients is not a direct indication of the presence of viable viruses. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture system however, can acts as surrogate marker of infectiousness. Cell culture based studies performed mostly with hospitalized and moderate/severe COVID-19 claims that no replication competent virus is found after 9 days of the symptoms onset in respiratory samples. Therefore, it is now recommended 10 days isolation before patient discharge.

MethodsWe cell-cultured 29 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR positive respiratory samples at the 10th day after the illness in Vero E6 cells. After two passages, cytopathic effect and cycle threshold (CT) lower than the obtained in the original sample were used to determine positivity.

FindingsWe found viable particles in (7/29) 24% of samples tested. The positivity in cell culture was strongly associated (p<0.0001) to the low cycle thresholds in clinical samples (Ct <21).

Diagnostic sensitivity and the margin of error determine the false negative outcome of the diagnosis. A mathematical model had been developed to estimate the mean % secondary infections based on the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity, % prevalence and R0 value. This model recommends a diagnostic test with diagnostic sensitivity [&ge;] 96% and at least 92% lower bound limit of the 95% CI or [&le;] 4% margin of error for a highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 to curb the secondary transmission of the infection due to false negative cases. Positive relationship was found between mean % secondary infection and margin of error of sensitivity suggesting greater the margin of error of a diagnostic test sensitivity, higher the number of secondary infections in a population due to false negative cases. Negative correlation was found between number of COVID-19 test kits (>90% sensitivity) with regulatory approval and margin of error (R= -0.92, p=0.023) suggesting lesser the margin of error of a diagnostic test, higher the chances of getting approved by the regulatory agencies. However, there are no specific regulatory standards available for margin of error of the diagnostic sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Highly infectious disease such as COVID-19, certainly need specific regulatory standards on margin of error or 95% CI of the diagnostic sensitivity to curb the dissemination of the disease due to false negative cases and our model can be used to set the standards such as sensitivity, margin of error or lower bound limit of 95% CI.",Azhahianambi Palavesam; Karthik Kumaragurubaran; Aravindh Babu R Parthiban; Senthilkumar TMA; Balachandran Chidambaram; Dhinakar Raj Gopal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250804,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250804,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
242,MOATAI-VIR - an AI algorithm that predicts severe adverse events and molecular features for COVID-19's complications,"Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, some COVID-19 patients experience severe adverse events caused by pathogenic host responses. To treat these complications, their underlying etiology must be identified. Thus, a novel AI-based methodology, MOATAI-VIR, which predicts disease-protein-pathway relationships for 22 clinical manifestations attributed to COVID-19 was developed. SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins and GWAS identified respiratory failure associated risk genes provide the input from which the mode-of-action (MOA) proteins/pathways of the resulting disease comorbidities are predicted. These comorbidities are then mapped to their clinical manifestations. Three uncharacterized manifestation categories are found: neoplasms, mental and behavioral disorders, and congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. The prevalence of neoplasms suggests a possible association between COVID-19 and cancer, whether by shared molecular mechanisms between oncogenesis and viral replication, or perhaps, SARS-CoV-2 is an oncovirus. To assess the molecular basis of each manifestation, the proteins shared across each group of comorbidities were prioritized and subject to global pathway analysis. From these most frequent pathways, the molecular features associated with hallmark COVID-19 phenotypes, such as loss of sense of smell/taste, unusual neurological symptoms, cytokine storm, and blood clots were explored.

243,Retinol Depletion in Severe COVID-19,"Background and PurposeVitamin A is depleted during infections. Vitamin A has been used successfully in measles, RSV and AIDS patients and is an effective vaccine adjuvant. In this study, low retinol levels were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Retinoid signaling impairment in COVID-19 disrupts Type-I interferon synthesis.

Material and MethodTwo groups were formed in the study. The patient group consisted of 27 (Group 1) severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with respiratory failure, and the control group consisted of 23 (Group 2) patients without COVID-19 symptoms. Serum retinol levels were analyzed by ELIZA and HPLC in both groups.

FindingsRetinol levels were found to be significantly lower in the patient group (P <0.001). There was no difference in retinol between two different age groups in the patient group (P> 0.05). There was no significant difference in retinol between men and women (P> 0.05). Comorbidity did not affect serum retinol levels (P >0.05).

ConclusionSerum retinol levels were low in patients with severe COVID-19. Drugs preventing retinol excretion were not stopped in the patient group. Some patients took vitamin A externally. Despite this, retinol was low in COVID-19 patients. Retinol depletion impairs Type-I interferon synthesis by impairing retinoid signaling. Retinoid signaling may be the main pathogenetic disorder in COVID-19. This pathogenesis can serve as a guide for adjuvants, drug targets, and candidate drugs.

244,Sensitive extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus detection using a novel RNA preparation method,"Current conventional detection of SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a patient sample with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in a viral transport medium, extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). We developed a simplified and novel preparation method using a Chelex resin that obviates RNA extraction during viral testing. Direct detection RT-qPCR and digital-droplet PCR was compared to the current conventional method with RNA extraction for simulated samples and patient specimens. The heat-treatment in the presence of Chelex markedly improved detection sensitivity as compared to heat alone, and lack of RNA extraction shortens the overall diagnostic workflow. Furthermore, the initial sample heating step inactivates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, thus improving workflow safety. This fast RNA preparation and detection method is versatile for a variety of samples, safe for testing personnel, and suitable for standard clinical collection and testing on high throughput platforms.",Bin Guan; Karen M Frank; Jose O Maldonado; Margaret Beach; Eileen Pelayo; Blake M Warner; Robert B Hufnagel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250790,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250790,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
245,Differential Cytokine Signatures of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Infection Highlight Key Differences in Pathobiology,"BackgroundSeveral inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in severe COVID-19. We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease.

MethodsThirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 145 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI on disease severity.

ResultsIL-18, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF- were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-{gamma}, IFN-{lambda}1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF- were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-{lambda}1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity.

ConclusionsThese findings point to activation of fundamentally different innate immune pathways in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection, and emphasize drivers of severe COVID-19 to focus both mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.

SummarySevere COVID-19 is marked by dysregulated inflammation and is associated with elevated BMI.

246,Single Dose Vaccination in Healthcare Workers Previously Infected with SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine shortages have led some experts and countries to consider untested dosing regimens. We studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers (HCW) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and compared to them to antibody responses of HCW who were IgG negative to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. HCW with prior COVID-19 showed clear secondary antibody responses to vaccination with IgG spike binding titers rapidly increasing by 7 days and peaking by days 10 and 14 post-vaccination. At all time points tested, HCW with prior COVID-19 infection showed statistically significant higher antibody titers of binding and functional antibody compared to HCW without prior COVID-19 infection (p<.0001for each of the time points tested). In times of vaccine shortage, and until correlates of protection are identified, our findings preliminarily suggest the following strategy as more evidence-based: a) a single dose of vaccine for patients already having had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; and b) patients who have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.",Saman Saadat; Zahra Rikhtegaran-Tehrani; James Logue; Michelle Newman; Matthew B Frieman; Anthony D.

247,Diagnostic accuracy of PanbioTM rapid antigen tests on oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundAntigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities for testing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS.

Results402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2-86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) for the Ag-RDT.

For cycle threshold values [&le;] 26.7 ([&ge;] 1E6 SARS-CoV-2 genomes copies/mL, a presumed cut-off for infectious virus), 96.3% sensitivity (95%CI: 90.7-99.0%) was obtained with the Ag-RDT using OPS.

248,Under what circumstances could vaccination offset the harm from a more transmissible variant of SARS-COV-2 in NYC? Trade-offs regarding prioritization and speed of vaccination.,"IntroductionNew York City (NYC) was a global epicenter of COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 became available in December 2020 with limited supply, resulting in the need for policies regarding prioritization. The next month, SARS-CoV-2 variants were detected that were more transmissible but still vaccine-susceptible, raising scrutiny of these policies. In particular, prioritization of higher-risk people could prevent more deaths per dose of vaccine administered but could also delay herd immunity if the prioritization introduced bottlenecks that lowered vaccination speed (the number of doses that could be delivered per day). We used mathematical modeling to examine the trade-off between prioritization and the vaccination speed.

MethodsA stochastic, discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model with age- and comorbidity-adjusted COVID-19 outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by July 1, 2021) was used to examine the trade-off between vaccination speed and whether or not vaccination was prioritized to individuals age 65+ and ""essential workers,"" defined as including first responders and healthcare, transit, education, and public safety workers. The model was calibrated to COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital census, ICU census, and deaths in NYC. Vaccination speed was assumed to be 10,000 doses per day starting December 15th, 2020 targeting healthcare workers and nursing home populations, and to subsequently expand at alternative starting times and speeds. We compared COVID-outcomes across alternative expansion starting times (January 15th, January 21st, or February 1st) and speeds (20,000, 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, or 200,000 doses per day for the first dose), as well as alternative prioritization options (""yes"" versus ""no"" prioritization of essential workers and people age 65+). Model projections were produced with and without considering the emergence of a SARS-COV-2 variant with 56% greater transmissibility over January and February, 2021.

ResultsIn the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, the emergence of the more transmissible variant would triple the peak in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths and more than double cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. To offset the harm from the more transmissible variant would require reaching a vaccination speed of at least 100,000 doses per day by January 15th or 150,000 per day by January 21st. Prioritizing people ages 65+ and essential workers increased the number of lives saved per vaccine dose delivered: with the emergence of a more transmissible variant, 8,000 deaths could be averted by delivering 115,000 doses per day without prioritization or 71,000 doses per day with prioritization. If prioritization were to cause a bottleneck in vaccination speed, more lives would be saved with prioritization only if the bottleneck reduced vaccination speed by less than one-third of the maximum vaccine delivery capacity. These trade-offs between vaccination speed and prioritization were robust over a wide range of delivery capacity.

ConclusionsThe emergence of a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to triple the 2021 epidemic peak and more than double the 2021 COVID-19 burden in NYC. Vaccination could only offset the harm of the more transmissible variant if high speed were achieved in mid-to late January. Prioritization of COVID-19 vaccines to higher-risk populations saves more lives only if it does not create an excessive vaccine delivery bottleneck.",Hae-Young Kim; Anna Bershteyn; Jessica McGillen; R.

249,Genetically predicted serum vitamin D and COVID-19: a Mendelian randomization study,"ObjectivesTo investigate causality of the association of serum vitamin D with the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection.

DesignTwo-sample Mendelian randomization study.

SettingSummary data from genome-wide analyses in the population-based UK Biobank and SUNLIGHT Consortium, applied to meta-analyzed results of genome-wide analyses in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative.

Participants17,965 COVID-19 cases including 11,085 laboratory or physician confirmed cases, 7,885 hospitalized cases, and 4,336 severe respiratory cases, and 1,370,547 controls, primarily of European ancestry.

ExposuresGenetically predicted variation in serum vitamin D status, based on genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum vitamin D or risk of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency.

Main outcome measuresSusceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection, including severe respiratory infection and hospitalization.

ResultsMendelian randomization analysis, powered to detect moderate effects comparable to those seen in observational studies, provided little to no evidence for an effect of genetically predicted serum vitamin D on susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19 infection. Using SNPs in loci related to vitamin D metabolism as proxies for serum vitamin D concentration, the odds ratio for a standard deviation increase in serum vitamin D was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.18) for any COVID-19 infection versus population controls, 1.05 (0.84-1.31) for hospitalized COVID-19 versus population controls, 0.96 (0.64 to 1.43) for severe respiratory COVID-19 versus population controls, 1.15 (0.99 to 1.35) for COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative, and 1.44 (0.75 to 2.78) for hospitalized COVID-19 versus non-hospitalized COVID-19. Results were similar in analyses that used all SNPs with genome-wide significant associations with serum vitamin D (i.e., including SNPs in loci with no known relationship to vitamin D metabolism) and in analyses using SNPs with genome-wide significant associations with risk of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that genetically predicted differences in long-term vitamin D nutritional status do not causally affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection, and that associations observed in previous studies may have been driven by confounding. These results do not exclude the possibility of low-magnitude causal effects, nor do they preclude potential causal effects of acute responses to therapeutic doses of vitamin D.

We report a lineage data collected from hospitals in the Kanto region of Japan.

MethodsWe performed whole genome sequencing in specimens of 198 COVID-19 patients at 13 collaborating hospitals in the Kanto region. Phylogenetic analysis and fingerprinting of the nucleotide substitutions underwent to differentiate and classify the viral lineages.

ResultsMore than 90% of the strains belonged to Clade 20B and two lineages (B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214) have been detected predominantly in the Kanto region. However, one sample from a COVID-19 patient in November 2020, belonged to the B.1.346 lineage of Clade 20C, which has been prevalent in western United States. The patient had no history of overseas travel and no contact with anyone who had travelled abroad, suggesting that this strain appeared likely to have been imported from western United States, across the strict quarantine barrier.

ConclusionB.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214 have been identified predominantly in the Kanto region and B.1.346 of clade 20C in one patient was probably imported from western United States. These results illustrate that a decentralized network of hospitals can be significantly advantageous for monitoring regional molecular epidemiologic trends.

251,Aerosol emission from the respiratory tract: an analysis of relative risks from oxygen delivery systems,"BackgroundRisk of aerosolisation of SARS-CoV-2 directly informs organisation of acute healthcare and PPE guidance. Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) are widely used modes of oxygen delivery and respiratory support for patients with severe COVID-19, with both considered as high risk aerosol generating procedures. However, there are limited high quality experimental data characterising aerosolisation during oxygen delivery and respiratory support.

MethodsHealthy volunteers were recruited to breathe, speak, and cough in ultra-clean, laminar flow theatres followed by using oxygen and respiratory support systems. Aerosol emission was measured using two discrete methodologies, simultaneously. Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 were also recruited and had aerosol emissions measured during breathing, speaking, and coughing.

FindingsIn healthy volunteers (n = 25 subjects; 531 measures), CPAP (with exhalation port filter) produced less aerosols than breathing, speaking and coughing (even with large >50L/m facemask leaks). HFNO did emit aerosols, but the majority of these particles were generated from the HFNO machine, not the patient. HFNO-generated particles were small (<1m), passing from the machine through the patient and to the detector without coalescence with respiratory aerosol, thereby unlikely to carry viral particles. Coughing was associated with the highest aerosol emissions with a peak concentration at least 10 times greater the mean concentration generated from speaking or breathing. Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (n = 8 subjects; 56 measures) had similar size distributions to healthy volunteers.

InterpretationIn healthy volunteers, CPAP is associated with less aerosol emission than breathing, speaking or coughing. Aerosol emission from the respiratory tract does not appear to be increased by HFNO. Although direct comparisons are complex, cough appears to generate significant aerosols in a size range compatible with airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As a consequence, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation is likely to be high in all areas where patients with Covid-19 are coughing. Guidance on personal protective equipment policy should reflect these updated risks.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPubMed was searched from inception until 10/1/21 using the terms  aerosol, and variations of  non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and  high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Studies were included if they measured aerosol generated from volunteers or patients receiving non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) or high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO), or provided experimental evidence on a simulated human setting. One study was identified (Gaeckle et al, 2020) which measured aerosol emission with one methodology (APS) but was limited by high background concentration of aerosol and a low number of participants (n = 10).

Added value of this studyThis study used multiple methodologies to measure aerosol emission from the respiratory tract before and during CPAP and high-flow nasal oxygen, in an ultra-clean, laminar flow theatre with near-zero background aerosol and recruited patients with COVID-19 to ensure similar aerosol distributions. We conclude that there is negligible aerosol generation with CPAP, that aerosol emission from HFNO is from the machine and not the patient, coughing emits aerosols consistent with airborne transmission of SARS CoV2 and that healthy volunteers are a reasonable proxy for COVID-19 patients.

Implications of all the available evidenceCPAP and HFNO should not be considered high risk aerosol generating procedures, based on our study and that of Gaeckle et al. Recorded aerosol emission from HFNO stems from the machine. Cough remains a significant aerosol risk. PPE guidance should be updated to ensure medical staff are protected with appropriate PPE in situations when patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 are likely to cough.",Fergus W Hamilton; Florence Gregson; David T Arnold; Sadiyah Sheikh; Kirsty Ward; Jules Brown; Ed Moran; Carrie White; Anna Morley; - AERATOR Group; Bryan R Bzdek; Jonathan Reid; Nick Maskell; James W Dodd,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250552,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250552,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
252,Impact of public sentiments on the transmission of COVID-19 across a geographical gradient,"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a recently discovered, novel coronavirus, SARS-COV2. The disease has led to over 81 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, with close to 2 million deaths. In the current social climate, the risk of COVID-19 infection is driven by individual and public perception of risk and sentiments. A number of factors influences public perception, including an individuals belief system, prior knowledge about a disease and information about a disease. In this paper, we develop a model for COVID-19 using a system of ordinary differential equations following the natural history of the infection. The model uniquely incorporates social behavioral aspects such as quarantine and quarantine violation. The model is further driven by peoples sentiments (positive and negative) which accounts for the influence of disinformation. Peoples sentiments were obtained by parsing through and analyzing COVID-19 related tweets from Twitter, a social media platform across six countries. Our results show that our model incorporating public sentiments is able to capture the trend in the trajectory of the epidemic curve of the reported cases. Furthermore, our results show that positive public sentiments reduce disease burden in the community. Our results also show that quarantine violation and early discharge of the infected population amplifies the disease burden on the community. Hence, it is important to account for public sentiment and individual social behavior in epidemic models developed to study diseases like COVID-19.",Folashade Agusto; Eric Numfor; Srinivasan Karthik; Enahoro Iboi; Alexander Fulk; Jarron M.

253,Testing out of quarantine,"Since SARS-CoV-2 emerged, a 14-day quarantine has been recommended based on COVID-19""s incubation period. Using an RT-PCR or rapid antigen test to ""test out"" of quarantine is a frequently proposed strategy to shorten duration without increasing risk. We calculated the probability that infected individuals test negative for SARS-CoV-2 on a particular day post-infection and remain symptom free for some period of time. We estimate that an infected individual has a 20.1% chance (95% CI 9.8-32.6) of testing RT-PCR negative on day five post-infection and remaining asymptomatic until day seven. We also show that the added information a test provides decreases as we move further from the test date, hence a less sensitive test that returns rapid results is often preferable to a more sensitive test with a delay.",Lucy D'Agostino McGowan; Elizabeth C.

254,Predicting Prognosis in COVID-19 Patients using Machine Learning and Readily Available Clinical Data,"RationalePrognostic tools for aiding in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients could help improve outcome by identifying patients at higher or lower risk of severe disease.

ObjectivesThe study objective was to develop models to stratify patients by risk of severe outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalization using readily available information at hospital admission.

MethodsHierarchical ensemble classification models were trained on a set of 229 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to predict severe outcomes, including ICU admission, development of ARDS, or intubation, using easily attainable attributes including basic patient characteristics, vital signs at admission, and basic lab results collected at time of presentation. Each test stratifies patients into groups of increasing risk. An additional cohort of 330 patients was used for blinded, independent validation. Shapley value analysis evaluated which attributes contributed most to the models predictions of risk.

Measurements and Main ResultsTest performance was assessed using precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity) of the final risk groups. All test cut-offs were fixed prior to blinded validation. In both development and validation, the tests achieved precision in the lowest risk groups near or above 0.9. The proportion of patients with severe outcomes significantly increased across increasing risk groups. While the importance of attributes varied by test and patient, CRP, LDH, and D-dimer were often found to be important in the assignment of risk label.

255,"""This is really like waiting for war and this is not good"" - Intertwining between pandemic experiences, and the development of professional action of healthcare professionals in critical care at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: a qualitative study","Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are facing remarkable challenges in their daily work since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Being well prepared is crucial for dealing with such a pandemic. The aim of our study was to explore HCPs subjective perspectives on their professional action and coping strategies in critical care during the preparation and coping phase after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.

Together with HCPs working in critical care, we collaboratively designed an interview study based on an ethnomethodological approach. We performed semi-structured qualitative interviews via telephone or video call and analysed the data based on grounded theory.

Our research interest was focused on HCPs (qualified nurses, physicians, medical students) working in critical care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany between April and July 2020.

Our sample consisted of 39 HCPs (19 nurses, 17 physicians, three medical students, 18/39 female) from ten German federal states. All participants were involved in the acute care of COVID-19 infected patients in hospitals and had a mean professional experience of 14.8{+/-}10.1 years, 15 participants held a management position (e.g. senior physician or head nurse). We recruited participants via personal contacts and snowballing.

Initial and focused coding resulted in seven categories: Creating structural measures, handling operational changes, dealing with personal protective equipment, building up knowledge and skills, managing information, perceiving peer support and experiencing emotions.

Professional action and subjectively perceived preparedness (professional and emotional) interacted with each other. Their interrelation was not static, but rather dynamic and ambiguous according to the situation. The findings of our study can be beneficial in developing guidelines, policy interventions or personnel and work practice strategies.",Madlen Hoerold; Karl Philipp Drewitz; Vreni Brunnthaler; Julia Piel; Magdalena Rohr; Ilona Hrudey; Claudia Hasenpusch; Angela Ulrich; Niklas Otto; Susanne Brandstetter; Christian Apfelbacher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250626,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250626,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
256,Accuracy of four lateral flow immunoassays for anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: a head-to-head comparative study,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are used for population surveillance and might have a future role in individual risk assessment. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver results rapidly and at scale, but have widely varying accuracy.

MethodsIn a laboratory setting, we performed head-to-head comparisons of four LFIAs: the Rapid Test Consortiums AbC-19 Rapid Test, OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, and Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. We analysed blood samples from 2,847 key workers and 1,995 pre-pandemic blood donors with all four devices.

FindingsWe observed a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity: the IgG band of the SureScreen device and the AbC-19 device had higher specificities but OrientGene and Biomerica higher sensitivities. Based on analysis of pre-pandemic samples, SureScreen IgG band had the highest specificity (98.9%, 95% confidence interval 98.3 to 99.3%), which translated to the highest positive predictive value across any pre-test probability: for example, 95.1% (95%CI 92.6, 96.8%) at 20% pre-test probability. All four devices showed higher sensitivity at higher antibody concentrations (""spectrum effects""), but the extent of this varied by device.

InterpretationThe estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be used to adjust for test error rates when using these devices to estimate the prevalence of antibody. If tests were used to determine whether an individual has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in an example scenario in which 20% of individuals have antibodies we estimate around 5% of positive results on the most specific device would be false positives.

FundingPublic Health England.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched for evidence on the accuracy of the four devices compared in this study: OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test and the UK Rapid Test Consortiums AbC-19 Rapid Test. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily), PubMed, MedRxiv/BioRxiv and Google Scholar from January 2020 to 16th January 2021. Search terms included device names AND ((SARS-CoV-2) OR (covid)). Of 303 records assessed, data were extracted from 24 studies: 18 reporting on the accuracy of the OrientGene device, 7 SureScreen, 2 AbC-19 and 1 Biomerica. Only three studies compared the accuracy of two or more of the four devices. With the exception of our previous report on the accuracy of the AbC-19 device, which the current manuscript builds upon, sample size ranged from 7 to 684. For details, see Supplementary Materials.

The largest study compared OrientGene, SureScreen and Biomerica. SureScreen was estimated to have the highest specificity (99.8%, 95% CI 98.9 to 100%) and OrientGene the highest sensitivity (92.6%), but with uncertainty about the latter result due to small sample sizes. The other two comparative studies were small (n = 65, n = 67) and therefore provide very uncertain results.

We previously observed spectrum effects for the AbC-19 device, such that sensitivity is upwardly biased if estimated only from PCR-confirmed cases. The vast majority of previous studies estimated sensitivity in this way.

Added value of this studyWe performed a large scale (n = 4,842), head-to-head laboratory-based evaluation and comparison of four lateral flow devices, which were selected for evaluation by the UK Department of Health and Social Cares New Tests Advisory Group, on the basis of a survey of test and performance data available. We evaluated the performance of diagnosis based on both IgG and IgM bands, and the IgG band alone. We found a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across devices, with the SureScreen and AbC-19 devices being more specific and OrientGene and Biomerica more sensitive. Based on analysis of 1,995 pre-pandemic blood samples, we are 99% confident that SureScreen (IgG band reading) has the highest specificity of the four devices (98.9%, 95% CI 98.3, 99.3%).

We found evidence that all four devices have reduced sensitivity at lower antibody indices, i.e. spectrum effects. However, the extent of this varies by device and appears to be less for other devices than for AbC-19.

Our estimates of sensitivity and specificity are likely to be higher than would be observed in real use of these devices, as they were based on majority readings of three trained laboratory personnel.

Implications of all the available evidenceWhen used in epidemiological studies of antibody prevalence, the estimates of sensitivity and specificity provided in this study can be used to adjust for test errors. Increased precision in error rates will translate to increased precision in seroprevalence estimates. If lateral flow devices were used for individual risk assessment, devices with maximum specificity would be preferable. However, if, for an example, 20% of the tested population had antibodies, we estimate that around 1 in 20 positive results on the most specific device would be incorrect.",Hayley E Jones; Ranya Mulchandani; Sian Taylor-Phillips; A E Ades; Justin Shute; Keith Perry; Nastassya Chandra; Tim Brooks; Andre Charlett; Matthew Hickman; Isabel Oliver; Stephen Kaptoge; John Danesh; Emanuele Di Angelantonio; - COMPARE Study investigators; - EDSAB-HOME investigators; David H WYLLIE,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250777,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250777,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

ObjectivesTo investigate the characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and assess factors associated with poor outcomes.

DesignPatient-level retrospective cohort study

SettingUniversity of California five academic hospitals.

ParticipantsPatients [&ge;]18 years old with a confirmed test result for SAR-CoV-2 virus hospitalized at five UC hospitals.

ExposureConfirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive results on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring hospital admission.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAdmission to the intensive care unit, death during hospitalization, and the composite of both outcomes.

ResultsOutcomes were assessed for 4,730 patients who were discharged or died during a hospitalization. A total of 846 patients were treated at UC Davis, 1,564 UC Irvine, 1,283 UC Los Angeles, 471 UC San Diego, and 566 UC San Francisco. More than 20% of patients were [&ge;]75 years of age (75-84: 12.3%, [&ge;]85: 10.5%), male (56.5%), Hispanic/Latino (45.7%), and Asian (10.3%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (35.2%), cardiac disease (33.3%), and diabetes (24.0%). The ICU admission rate was 25.2% (1194/4730), with 7.0% (329/4730) in-hospital mortality. Among patients admitted to the ICU, 18.8% (225/1194) died; 2.9% (104/3536) died without ICU admission. The rate of the composite outcome (ICU admission and/or death) was 27.4% (1,298/4,730). While controlling for comorbidities, patients of age 75-84 (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.11-1.93) and 85-59 (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.87) were more likely to experience a composite outcome than 18-34 year-olds. Males (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.21-1.59), and patients identifying as Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.14-1.61), and Asian (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.23-1.82), were also more likely to experience a composite outcome than White. Patients with 5 or more comorbidities were exceedingly likely to experience a composite outcome (OR 2.74, 95% CI: 2.32-3.25).

ConclusionsMales, older patients, those with pre-existing comorbidities, and those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or Asian experienced an increased risk of ICU admission and/or death.

258,Strategies for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently bring R<1,"With limited availability of vaccines, an efficient use of the limited supply of vaccines in order to achieve herd immunity will be an important tool to combat the wide-spread prevalence of COVID-19. Here, we propose a targeted vaccination approach (EHR) that provides a significant reduction in the necessary number of doses needed achieve herd immunity compared to age-prioritized and random selection vaccination schemes. Using high-fidelity individual-based computer simulations with Oslo, Norway as an example, we find that for a community reproductive number in a setting where R=1.4 without population immunity, the EHR method reaches herd immunity at only 15% of the population vaccinated, whereas the common age-prioritized approach needs 40%. With R=1.9 in the absence of immunity, EHR needs 30% and age-prioritized needs 52%.",Andre Voigt; Stig William Omholt; Eivind Almaas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250828,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250828,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
259,COVID-19 spread and Weather in U.S. states: a cross-correlative study on summer-autumn 2020.,"An effect of weather on sars-cov-2 transmission is regularly proposed as a putative cause of unexplained fluctuations of covid-19 new cases, but clear data supporting this hypothesis remains to be presented. Here I measured longitudinal time-series correlations between outdoor temperature, humidity and covid-19 reproduction number (Rt) in the 50 U.S. states (+DC). In order to mitigate the confounding influence of varying social restriction measures, the analysis spans a 5-month period during summer and autumn 2020 when restrictions were comparatively lower and more stable. I used a cross-covariance approach to account for a variable delay between infection and case report. For a delay near 11 days, most U.S. states exhibited a negative correlation between outdoor temperature and Rt, as well as between absolute humidity and Rt (mean r = -0.35). In 21 states, the correlation was strong (r < -0.5). Individual state data are presented, and associations between cold and/or dry weather episodes and short-term new case surges are proposed. After identifying potential confounding factors, I discuss 3 possible causal mechanisms that could explain a correlation between outdoor weather and indoor disease transmission: behavioral adaptations to cold weather, respiratory tract temperature, and the importing of outdoor absolute humidity to indoor spaces.",Emmanuel de Margerie,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250793,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250793,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

261,Understanding soaring coronavirus cases and the effect of contagion policies in the UK,"The number of new daily SARS-CoV-2 infections is frantically rising in almost every country of the EU. The phenomenological explanation offered is a new mutation of the virus, first identified in the UK. We use publicly available data in combination with a controlled SIR model, which captures the effects of preventive measures on the active cases, to show that the current wave of infections is consistent with a single transmission rate. This suggests that the new SARS-CoV-2 variant is as transmissible as previous strains. Our findings indicate that the relaxation of preventive measures is closely related with the ongoing surge in cases. We simulate the effects of new restrictions and vaccination campaigns in 2021, demonstrating that lockdown policies are not fully effective to flatten the curve. For effective mitigation, it is critical that the public keeps on high alert until vaccination reaches a critical threshold.",Miguel A Duran-Olivencia; Serafim Kalliadasis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250822,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250822,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
262,Impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the postpartum experience of women living in Eastern Canada: A mixed method cohort study,"ObjectivesTo (1) compare changes in self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression in Canadian women collected before (Cohort 1) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cohort 2); (2) explore the women felt related to having a newborn during the pandemic; and (3) explore ways that women coped.

MethodsPrior to the pandemic (October 1, 2019-January 1, 2020), an online survey was conducted with women had given birth within the past six months in one of the three Eastern Canadian Maritime provinces (Cohort 1). A second, similar survey was conducted between August 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020 (Cohort 2) during a period of provincial pandemic response to COVID-19.

ResultsFor Cohort 1, 561 women completed the survey and 331 women in Cohort 2. Cohorts were similar in terms of age of women, parity, and age of newborn. There were no significant differences for self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety, and depression between the cohorts. Difficulties that women reported as a result of COVID-19 restrictions included lack of support from family and friends, fear of COVID-19 exposure, feeling isolated and uncertain, negative impact on perinatal care experience, and hospital restrictions. Having support from partners and families, in-person/virtual support, as well as self-care and the low prevalence of COVID-19 during the summer of 2020 helped women cope.

ConclusionWhile there was no significant difference in pre-pandemic and during pandemic psychosocial outcomes, there were still challenges and negative impacts that women identified. Consideration of vulnerable populations is important when making public health recommendations.

What is already known on this subject?Previous work has shown the importance of social support in the postpartum transition in developing parenting self-efficacy and decreasing postpartum anxiety and depression. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, womens mental health, particularly during the perinatal period, has seen an increases in rates of postpartum anxiety and depression.

What this study adds?This study is able to compare self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and depression between two cohorts of postpartum women living in Eastern Canada - pre-COVID-19 pandemic and during.

MethodsAn analytical cross-sectional study was carried out whose purpose was to identify the laboratory tests of patients with COVID-19 and mortality in a hospital in Ucayali, Peru during the period from March 13 to May 9, 2020, selecting a total of 127 with Covid-19. Mean and the standard deviation was described for age, leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets, RDW-SD; median and interquartile range for the variables lymphocyte, RN / L, fibrinogen, CRP, D-dimer, DHL, hematocrit, monocytes, eosinophils.

ResultsNo differences were observed in this population regarding death and sex (OR: 1.31; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.87), however, it was observed that, for each one-year increase, the probability of death increased by 4% (PR: 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.05). The IRR (Incidence Risk Ratio) analysis for the numerical variables showed results strongly associated with hematological values such as Leukocytes (scaled by 2500 units) (IRR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13), neutrophils (scaled by 2500 units) (IRR: 1.08; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13), on the contrary, it is observed that the increase of 1000 units in lymphocytes, the probability of dying decreased by 48% (IRR: 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 071).

264,Immuno-fibrotic drivers of impaired lung function in post-COVID-19 syndrome,"Introduction: Subjects recovering from COVID-19 frequently experience persistent respiratory ailments; however, little is known about the underlying biological factors that may direct lung recovery and the extent to which these are affected by COVID-19 severity. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of subjects with persistent symptoms after recovering from acute COVID-19 illness, collecting clinical data, pulmonary function tests, and blood. Plasma samples were used for multiplex profiling of circulating factors associated with inflammation, metabolism, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. Results: Sixty-one subjects were enrolled across two academic medical centers at a median of 9 weeks (interquartile range 6-10) after COVID-19 illness: n=13 subjects (21%) mild/non-hospitalized, n=30 (49%) hospitalized/non-critical, and n=18 subjects (30%) hospitalized/intensive care (ICU). Fifty-three subjects (85%) had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea (69%) and cough (58%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined as COVID-19 severity increased (P<0.05), but did not correlate with respiratory symptoms. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered subjects by past COVID-19 severity. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) identified by the model were significantly higher in the ICU group (P<0.05) and inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO (P<0.05). Conclusions: Subjective respiratory symptoms are common after acute COVID-19 illness but do not correlate with COVID-19 severity or pulmonary function. Host response profiles reflecting neutrophil activation (LCN2), fibrosis signaling (MMP-7), and alveolar repair (HGF) track with lung impairment and may be novel therapeutic or prognostic targets.",Hyung J.

265,Persistent COVID-19 symptoms minimally impact the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity,"SARS-CoV-2 represents an unprecedented public health challenge with many unknowns remaining regarding the factors that impact viral pathogenicity and the development of immunity after infection. While the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 resolve their infection with few complications, a significant number of individuals experienced prolonged symptoms lasting for weeks after initial diagnosis. Persistent viral infections are commonly accompanied by immunologic dysregulation, especially within the cellular immune compartment. However, it is unclear if persistent mild-to-moderate COVID-19 impacts the development of virus-specific cellular immunity. To this end, we analyzed the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity in convalescent COVID-19 patients who experienced eight days or fewer of COVID-19 symptoms, or symptoms persisting for 18 days or more. We observed that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms minimally impacts the magnitude, antigen specificity, and transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity within both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments. Furthermore, we observed that reactivity against the structural N protein from SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent COVID-19 patients correlates with the amount of reactivity against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL63.

266,Using time use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of COVID-19 social restrictions,"We present analyses of 24-hour time use diary records of the UK populations activities, their social context and their location, collected in real time from four successive waves of representative UK samples, both before, and during, the current COVID-19 pandemic. We show changes in behavioral response to social restrictions at three time-points during the pandemic, including across two nationwide lockdowns. Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the populations activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded May- June 2020). Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown. Disaggregating by gender and age group, the difference was found to be statistically significant for all groups, with the exception of those aged 55 and over.

Significance statementWhat do people do during lockdown? This set of data is unique in providing time use diary information in real time on changing behavior in the UK in response to each major change in social restrictions. This enables us to directly compare 24-hour continuous and comprehensive information on the populations activities, their social context and their location, comparing risk- related behavior during different phases of social restrictions.

267,Minimizing loss of life in Covid-19 in a 100 day period in the U.S.A. by age-tailored dosing and distribution of a limited vaccine supply,"Background: We aimed at minimizing loss of lives in the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA by identifying optimal vaccination strategies during a 100-day period with limited vaccine supplies. While lethality is highest in the elderly, transmission and case numbers are highest in the younger. A strategy of first vaccinating the elderly is widely used, thought to protect the vulnerable, elderly best. Despite lower immunogenicity in the elderly, mRNA vaccines retain high efficacy, implying that in the younger, reduced vaccine doses might suffice, thereby increasing vaccination counts with a given vaccine supply. Methods: Using published immunogenicity data of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, we examined the value of tailored-dose vaccination strategies, using a modeling approach incorporating age-related vaccine immunogenicity, social contact patterns, population structure, Covid-19 case and death rates in the USA in late January 2021. An increase if the number of persons that can be vaccinated and a potential reduction of the individual protective efficacy was accounted for. Results: Age-tailored dosing strategies reduced cases faster, shortening the pandemic, reducing the delay to reaching <100'000 cases/day from 64 to 30 days and avoiding 25'000 deaths within 100 days in the USA. In an 'elderly first' vaccination strategy, mortality is higher even in the elderly. Findings were robust with transmission blocking efficacies of reduced dose vaccination between 30% to 90%. Conclusion: Rapid reduction of Covid-19 case and death rate in the USA in 100 days with a limited vaccine supply is best achieved when personalized, age-tailored dosing for highly effective vaccines is used. Protecting the vulnerable is most effectively achieved by dose tailored vaccination of all population segments, while an 'elderly first' approach costs more lives, even in the elderly.",Patrick Hunziker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250834,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250834,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
268,Emergence of first strains of Sars-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Romania,"United Kingdom reported the emergence of a new and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7. that rapidly spread to other contries. The impact of this new mutation that occurs in the S protein, on infectivity, virulence and current vaccine effectiveness is still under evaluation. We have identified the first cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in samples collected from Romanian patients, of which one was traced to the UK region where the new variant was originally sequenced. Mutations in the Nsp3 protein, N844S and D455N and L15F in Orf3a were also detected, indicating common ancestry with UK strains as well as remote connections with strains from Nagasaki, Japan. These results indicate, for the first time, the presence and characteristics of the new variant B.1.1.7 in Romania and underscore the need for increased genomic sequencing in confirmed COVID-19 patients.",Andrei Lobiuc; Mihai Dimian; Olga Sturdza; Roxana Filip; Mihai Covasa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250643,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250643,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
269,Robust spike antibody responses and increased reactogenicity in seropositive individuals after a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine,"An important question is arising as COVID-19 vaccines are getting rolled out: Should individuals who already had a SARS-CoV-2 infection receive one or two shots of the currently authorized mRNA vaccines. In this short report, we show that the antibody response to the first vaccine dose in individuals with pre-existing immunity is equal to or even exceeds the titers found in naive individuals after the second dose. We also show that the reactogenicity is significantly higher in individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past. Changing the policy to give these individuals only one dose of vaccine would not negatively impact on their antibody titers, spare them from unnecessary pain and free up many urgently needed vaccine doses.",Florian Krammer; Komal Srivastava; - PARIS team; Viviana Simon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250653,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250653,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
270,"Structural basis of fitness of emerging SARS-COV-2 variants and considerations for screening, testing and surveillance strategy to contain their threat.","While emergence of new SAS-COV-2 variants is posing grave challenge to efforts to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, the structural and molecular basis of their fitness remain poorly understood. We performed in silico analysis of structures of two most frequent SARS-COV-2 mutations, namely, N501Y and E484K, to identify plausible basis of their fitness over the original strain. The analysis suggested that the N501Y mutation is associated with strengthening of intra- as well as intermolecular H-bond in the hACE2 receptor-spike protein complex, which could result in increased affinity and, therefore, higher infectivity. While E484K mutation did not seem to directly affect the binding with hACE2 receptor, it disrupted H-bonding and salt-bridge interaction associated with binding with neutralizing antibody, which could affect chance of re-infection, disease outcome. Survey of several other mutations showing reduction in antibody-mediated neutralization also revealed that similar disruption of H-bonding or salt-bridge or Van der Waals interaction might explain their phenotype. Analysis of GESS database indicated that N501Y, EK484 as well as these other mutations existed since March-April, 2020, might have evolved independently across the world and may keep accumulating, which could affect efficacy of vaccination and antibody-based therapies. Our analysis also indicated that these may spread in spite of current travel restrictions focused on few countries and evolve indigenously warranting intensification of surveillance for emerging mutations among all travellers as well as people in their dwelling zones. Meta-analysis of existing literature showed that repeat testing of travellers, contacts and others under scrutiny 7-11 days after the initial RT-PCR test may significantly help to contain the spread of emerging variants by catching false negative results. In addition, existing evidence calls for development of strain-specific tests, escalated sequencing and broadening the scope of surveillance including in hospitals and animal farms to contain the threat of emerging variants.",Sk Ramiz Islam; Debasish Prusty; Soumen Kanti Manna,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250666,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250666,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
271,How well do face masks protect the wearer compared to public perceptions?,"IntroductionThere is a growing body of evidence to support the wearing of face masks to reduce spread of infectious respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. However, the literature exploring the effectiveness of homemade fabric face masks is still in its infancy. Developing an evidence base is an important step to ensure that public policy is evidence based and truly effective.

MethodsTwo methodologies were used in this study: quantitative fit testing of various face masks to indicate their effectiveness and a survey of 710 US residents about their perceptions of face mask effectiveness. N95, surgical and two fabric face masks were tested on an individual twenty five times each using a TSI 8038+ machine. Our survey was distributed by Qualtrics XM, asking participants to estimate the effectiveness of N95, surgical and fabric face masks.

Results and DiscussionOur results indicate that fabric face masks blocked between 62.6% and 87.1% of fine particles, whereas surgical masks protected against an average of 78.2% of fine particles. N95 masks blocked 99.6% of fine particles. Survey respondents tended to underestimate the effectiveness of masks, especially fabric masks. Together these results suggest that fabric masks may be a useful tool in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic and that increasing public awareness of the effectiveness of fabric masks may help in this endeavour.",Eugenia O'Kelly; Anmol Arora; James Ward; P John Clarkson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250645,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250645,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
272,High-dimensional profiling reveals phenotypic heterogeneity and disease-specific alterations of granulocytes in COVID-19,"Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that the innate immune responses play an important role in the disease development. A dysregulated inflammatory state has been proposed as key driver of clinical complications in COVID-19, with a potential detrimental role of granulocytes. However, a comprehensive phenotypic description of circulating granulocytes in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is lacking. In this study, we used high-dimensional flow cytometry for granulocyte immunophenotyping in peripheral blood collected from COVID-19 patients during acute and convalescent phases. Severe COVID-19 was associated with increased levels of both mature and immature neutrophils, and decreased counts of eosinophils and basophils. Distinct immunotypes were evident in COVID-19 patients, with altered expression of several receptors involved in activation, adhesion and migration of granulocytes (e.g. CD62L, CD11a/b, CD69, CD63, CXCR4). Paired sampling revealed recovery and phenotypic restoration of the granulocytic signature in the convalescent phase. The identified granulocyte immunotypes correlated with distinct sets of soluble inflammatory markers supporting pathophysiologic relevance. Furthermore, clinical features, including multi-organ dysfunction and respiratory function, could be predicted using combined laboratory measurements and immunophenotyping. This study provides a comprehensive granulocyte characterization in COVID-19 and reveals specific immunotypes with potential predictive value for key clinical features associated with COVID-19.

SignificanceAccumulating evidence shows that granulocytes are key modulators of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their dysregulation could significantly impact COVID-19 severity and patient recovery after virus clearance. In the present study, we identify selected immune traits in neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil subsets associated to severity of COVID-19 and to peripheral protein profiles. Moreover, computational modeling indicates that the combined use of phenotypic data and laboratory measurements can effectively predict key clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Finally, patient-matched longitudinal analysis shows phenotypic normalization of granulocyte subsets 4 months after hospitalization. Overall, in this work we extend the current understanding of the distinct contribution of granulocyte subsets to COVID-19 pathogenesis.",Magda Lourda; Majda Dzidic; Laura Hertwig; Helena Bergsten; Laura M Palma Medina; Egle Kvedaraite; Jagadeeswara Rao Muvva; Jean-Baptiste Gorin; Martin Cornillet; Johanna Emgard; Kirsten Moll; Marina Garcia; Kimia T Maleki; Jonas Klingstrom; Jakob Michaelsson; Malin Flodstrom-Tullberg; Susanna Brighenti; Marcus Buggert; Jenny Mjosberg; Karl-Johan Malmberg; Johan K Sandberg; Jan-Inge Henter; Elin Folkesson; Sara Gredmark-Russ; Anders Sonnerborg; Lars I Eriksson; Olav Rooyackers; Soo Aleman; Kristoffer Stralin; Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren; Niklas K Bjorkstrom; Mattias Svensson; Andrea Ponzetta; Anna Norrby-Teglund; Benedict J Chambers; - Karolinska KI/K COVID-19 Study Group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250591,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250591,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
273,Modeling the asymptomatic prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and the ISTAT survey,"objectivesAugust 3rd, 2020, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) presented preliminary results of seroprevalence survey on the percentage of individuals affected by Covid-19. The survey aims to define (within the entire population of Italy) the portion of individuals that developed an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. For the first time one has an estimate of the asymptomatic infected population and the possibility to acknowledge its potential role in the infection spread in Italy, one of the most affected areas in Europe. The information obtained allow a particularly sensitive validation of epidemiological models which include the asymptomatic class.

methodsThe present study is devoted to the construction of a model able to simulate, in a systematic way, the asymptomatic group whose relevance in the, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, has been recently investigated and discussed. The investigation involves the description of the first epidemic outbreak in Italy as well as the predictive analysis of the ongoing second wave. In particular the possible correction to the data of the serological tests because of their sensitivity and specificity.

resultsThe model: taken as an example of the models presently used, satisfactory reproduces the data of the ISTAT survey showing a relevant predictive power and relegating in a secondary position models which do not include, in the simulation, the presence of asymptomatic groups. The corrections due to the serological test sensitivity (in particular those ones depending on the symptoms onset) make the comparison between data and models less accurate.

conclusionsThe predictions of the model confirm a relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals also during the second pandemic wave in Italy. The ratio of reported to unreported cases is predicted to be roughly 1:4. A more detailed knowledge of the results of the survey could allow to correct, in a relevant way, the data by means of the experimental evidences on the antibodies sensibility. The model analyses of the vaccination strategies, confirms the relevance of a massive administration with the beginning of the year to arrive at the end of the infection within August 2021.",Marco Claudio Traini; Carla Caponi; Riccardo Ferrari; Giuseppe Vittorio De Socio,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250597,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250597,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
274,Neighbourhood-level risk factors of COVID-19 incidence and mortality,"BackgroundRacialized and low income communities face disproportionally high rates of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death. However, data on inequities in COVID-19 across granular categories of socio-demographic characteristics is more sparse.

MethodsNeighbourhood-level counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ontario, Canada recorded as of July 28th, 2020 were extracted from provincial and local reportable infectious disease surveillance systems. Associations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality and 18 neighbourhood-level measures of immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics were estimated with Poisson generalized linear mixed models. Housing characteristic variables were subsequently added to models to explore if housing may have a confounding influence on the relationships between immigration, race, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence.

ResultsThere were large inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality across the socio-demographic variables examined. Neighbourhoods having a higher proportion immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status were associated with COVID-19 risk. Adjusting for housing characteristics, especially unsuitably crowded housing, attenuated COVID-19 risks. However persistent risk remained for neighbourhoods having high proportions of immigrants, racialized populations, and proportion of Black, Latin American, and South Asian residents.

ConclusionsSocio-demographic factors account for some of the neighbourhood-level differences in COVID-19 across Ontario. Housing characteristics account for a portion, but not all, of the excess burden of COVID-19 experienced by immigrant, racialized, low income and low education populations.",Trevor van Ingen; Kevin A Brown; Sarah A Buchan; Samantha Akingbola; Nick Daneman; Brendan T Smith,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250618,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250618,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
275,Forecasting virus outbreaks with social media data via neural ordinary differential equations,"In the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, social media data collected in real time has the potential of being an early indicator of a new epidemic wave. This possibility is explored here by using a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) that is trained to predict virus outbreaks for a geographic region. It learns from multivariate time series of signals obtained from a novel set of massive online surveys about COVID-19 symptoms. Once trained, the neural ODE is able to capture the dynamics of the interlinked local signals and accurately predict the number of new infections up to two months in advance. Moreover, it can estimate the future effects of changes in the number of infected at a given time, which can be associated with the flow of people entering or leaving a given region or, for instance, with a local vaccination campaign.

We developed a mathematical model capable of capturing the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 dissemination aligned with social distancing, isolation measures, and vaccination. The city of Rio de Janeiro provides a case study to analyze possible scenarios including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination in the epidemic scenario. Our results shows that a combination of different policies such as case isolation and social distancing are more effective for mitigating the epidemics.

278,SARS-CoV-2 Seroepidemiology in Children and Adolescents,"ObjectivesPediatric SARS-CoV-2 data remain limited and seropositivity rates in children were reported as <1% early in the pandemic. Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the United States was performed.

MethodsChildren and adolescents [&le;]19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, United States. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens.

ResultsIn 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Orthogonal antibody testing with a receptor binding domain specific antigen revealed a high concordance of 80.5%. Children also demonstrated a robust immune response to the nucleocapsid antigen.

ConclusionsA much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported; this was also higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19 infection. The role of childrens disease transmission must be considered in COVID-19 mitigation strategies including vaccination.

Article Summary8.5% of children had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Fall 2020, double the adult rate. The role of pediatric infection is important to consider in mitigation strategies.

Whats Known on This SubjectSARS-CoV-2 pediatric seroepidemiologic data is limited. Reported viral rates underestimate the burden of infection in children due to mild or asymptomatic disease. Limited cohorts of children suggest low seropositivity rates compared to adults.

What This Study AddsUS children in the largest SARS-CoV-2 seroepidemiology study to date had double the rate of antibodies compared to adults. Most children were asymptomatic.

279,REACT-1 round 8 final report: high average prevalence with regional heterogeneity of trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in England during January 2021,"In early January 2021, England entered its third national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce numbers of deaths and pressure on healthcare services, while rapidly rolling out vaccination to healthcare workers and those most at risk of severe disease and death. REACT-1 is a survey of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the community in England, based on repeated cross-sectional samples of the population. Between 6th and 22nd January 2021, out of 167,642 results, 2,282 were positive giving a weighted national prevalence of infection of 1.57% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.66%). The R number nationally over this period was estimated at 0.98 (0.92, 1.04). Prevalence remained high throughout, but with suggestion of a decline at the end of the study period. The average national trend masked regional heterogeneity, with robustly decreasing prevalence in one region (South West) and increasing prevalence in another (East Midlands). Overall prevalence at regional level was highest in London at 2.83% (2.53%, 3.16%). Although prevalence nationally was highest in the low-risk 18 to 24 year old group at 2.44% (1.96%, 3.03%), it was also high in those over 65 years who are most at risk, at 0.93% (0.82%, 1.05%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with higher levels of infections compared to smaller households, less deprived neighbourhoods and other ethnicities. Healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, were more likely to test positive compared to other workers.

280,Mapping a Pandemic: SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity in the United States,"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed implementation of diagnostics have led to poorly defined viral prevalence rates. To address this, we analyzed seropositivity in US adults who have not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Individuals with characteristics that reflect the US population (n = 11,382) and who had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 were selected by quota sampling from 241,424 volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04334954). Enrolled participants provided medical, geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic information and 9,028 blood samples. The majority (88.7%) of samples were collected between May 10th and July 31st, 2020. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies. Estimation of seroprevalence was performed by using a weighted analysis to reflect the US population. We detected an undiagnosed seropositivity rate of 4.6% (95% CI: 2.6 - 6.5%). There was distinct regional variability, with heightened seropositivity in locations of early outbreaks. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest estimated undiagnosed seropositivity within groups was detected in younger participants (ages 18-45, 5.9%), females (5.5%), Black/African American (14.2%), Hispanic (6.1%), and Urban residents (5.3%), and lower undiagnosed seropositivity in those with chronic diseases. During the first wave of infection over the spring/summer of 2020 an estimate of 4.6% of adults had a prior undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that there were 4.8 (95% CI: 2.8-6.8) undiagnosed cases for every diagnosed case of COVID-19 during this same time period in the United States, and an estimated 16.8 million undiagnosed cases by mid-July 2020.",Heather Kalish; Carleen Klumpp-Thomas; Sally Hunsberger; Holly Ann Baus; Michael P Fay; Nalyn Siripong; Jing Wang; Jennifer Hicks; Jennifer Mehalko; Jameson Travers; Matthew Drew; Kyle Pauly; Jacquelyn Spathies; Tran Ngo; Kenneth M Adusei; Maria Karkanitsa; Jennifer A Croker; Yan Li; Barry I Graubard; Lindsay Czajkowski; Olivia Belliveau; Cheryl Chairez; Kelly Snead; Peter Frank; Anandakumar Shunmugavel; Alison Han; Luca T Giurgea; Luz Angela Rosas; Rachel Bean; Rani Athota; Adriana Cervantes-Medina; Monica Gouzoulis; Brittany Heffelfinger; Shannon Valenti; Rocco Caldararo; Michelle M Kolberg; Andrew Kelly; Reid Simon; Saifullah Shafiq; Vanessa Wall; Susan Reed; Eric W Ford; Ravi Lokwani; John-Paul Denson; Simon Messing; Sam G Michael; William Gillette; Robert P Kimberly; Steven E Reis; Matthew D Hall; Dominic Esposito; Matthew J Memoli; Kaitlyn Sadtler,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250570,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250570,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True

282,Nationwide Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Saudi Arabia,"BackgroundEstimated seroprevalence of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a critical evidence for a better evaluation of the virus spread and monitoring the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in a population. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA total of 11703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates

ResultsOverall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95-10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension. The study also presents the demographics and prevalence of co-morbidities in HCWs and subset of non-COVID-19 population.

283,Evidence for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in the Urine of COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has so far affected over 42 million people worldwide, causing over 1.1 million deaths. With the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals being asymptomatic, major concerns have been raised about possible long-term consequences of the infection. We developed an antigen capture assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in urine samples from COVID-19 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs (NP-PCR+). The study used a collection of 233 urine samples from 132 participants from Yale New Haven Hospital and the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia obtained during the pandemic (106 NP-PCR+ and 26 NP-PCR-) as well as a collection of 20 urine samples from 20 individuals collected before the pandemic. Our analysis identified 23 out of 91 (25%) NP-PCR+ adult participants with SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein in urine (Ur-S+). Interestingly, although all NP-PCR+ children were Ur-S-, 1 NP-PCR-child was found to be positive for spike protein in urine. Of the 23 Ur-S+ adults, only 1 individual showed detectable viral RNA in urine. Our analysis further showed that 24% and 21% of NP-PCR+ adults have high levels of albumin and cystatin C in urine, respectively. Among individuals with albuminuria (>0.3 mg/mg of creatinine) statistical correlation could be found between albumin and spike protein in urine. Together, our data showe that 1 of 4 of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals develop renal abnormalities such as albuminuria.

284,Serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers of a tertiary care teaching institution in Central Kerala during the post lockdown phase,"BackgroundKerala was the first state to have the confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country and it was first confirmed in Thrissur district on 30 January2020.Our institute being in the heart of the city had to take adequate measures to mitigate the spread and treat the required patients by keeping its staff safe & Healthy. The hallmark of COVID 19 infection is high infectivity, pre-symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic prevalence which could result in high cumulative numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Kerala was the first state to confirm community transmission in July 2020.Health care workers being in the forefront in the war against COVID19 are very prone in acquiring the infection and are possible to be asymptomatic sources for cluster formation. Knowing the development of immunity as shown by the presence of anti COV2 antibodies in the population contributes to the epidemiological understanding of the disease. The intent of the study is to do an antibody testing in our hospital to find the serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers in our hospital.

AimTo estimate the seropositivity of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers at Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala, six months after revoking the lockdown

MethodologyA cross sectional study among the health care workers of the medical college. Multistage Sampling was done with the hospital block as the first stage and departments as the second stage. In the final stage of sampling the test individuals were selected on a first come first served basis after the antibody test availability was declared open and free for all staff. A consent form and a Google form were given to all staff who volunteered for participating in the study. Each consented participant recruited into the investigation completed a questionnaire which covers details regarding demographics, exposure history, Residence & travel. Blood sample was collected and Anti-SARS COV2 IgG antibody testing which targets the Spike Protein 1(SP1) was done using the VITROS chemiluminescence platform (Orthoclinical diagnostics, USA). Sampling & testing ranged over a time frame from September 5th to December 15th, 2020

ResultsJubilee Mission Medical College has 2785 working staff at the time of study. A total of 420 staff consented and their samples were tested. 37 staff members tested positive for COVID-19 antibody, yielding an overall prevalence of 8.75% (95% CI, 6.23-11.86). 86.5 % (32/37) of them were having a history of COVID-19 Antigen / RT PCR Positivity. We identified a statistically significant linear trend (p value =0.00001), between seropositivity and the degree of severity of COVID 19. Among the various factors which increase the risk of seroconversion, history of undergoing quarantine (p value < 0.001), contact with a confirmed case (p value = 0.002), contact with a caregiver for COVID 19 (p value =0.001) and history of Upper respiratory symptoms (p value =0.001), were found to be significantly associated with positive serology.

ConclusionsThe overall seropositivity in the current study was found to be 8.75% which is comparable to seroprevalence studies conducted in the United States and Wuhan in China. The pattern of seropositivity across the different category of health workers observed in the present study showed a higher prevalence among nurses. This result is also in agreement with a recent published report from united states. Various measures advised by the national and state health authorities were adequately adhered to. Keeping track of the pattern of development of immunity in the community is part of understanding the illness and forecasting the spread. For the tested HCW, it will boost up morale by ending uncertainty. For the hospital administration it will help in decision making about relative focusing of interventions on patients in general and HCWs. By knowing the immunity status of HCWs, the Institution will be able to contribute authentically to the development of intervention strategies and guidelines from time to time, besides following the available guidelines. Being an educational institution, it is obligatory to train all the elements of care delivery to the future generation of health care workers.

285,SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic test enhanced with silver amplification technology,"Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential for instituting measures to prevent viral spread. SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) based on lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) principle can visually indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as a band. Ag-RDT is clinically promising as a point-of-care testing because it can give results in a short time without the need for special equipment. Although various antigen capture LFIAs are now available for rapid diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they face the problems of low sensitivity. We have previously developed highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and in this study, we have employed these mAbs to develop a new LFIA that can detect SARS-CoV-2 NP in nasopharyngeal swab samples with higher sensitivity by combining them with silver amplification technology. We also compared the performance of our Ag-RDT against the commercially available Ag-RDTs using clinical samples to find that our newly developed LFIA performed best among tested, highlighting the superiority of silver amplification technology.",Kei Miyakawa; Rikako Funabashi; Yutaro Yamaoka; Sundararaj Stanleyraj Jeremiah; Junichi Katada; Atsuhiko Wada; Toshiki Takei; Kohei Shimizu; Hiroki Ozawa; Chiharu Kawakami; Shuzo Usuku; Nobuko Tanaka; Etsuko Yamazaki; Hideaki Shimizu; Nobuhiko Okabe; Hideki Hasegawa; Akihide Ryo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250659,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250659,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
286,Awake prone positioning and oxygen therapy in patients with COVID-19: The APRONOX study,"PurposeThe awake prone position (PP) strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a safe, simple, and cost-effective technique used to improve hypoxemia. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between awake PP (AP) and endotracheal intubation in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

MethodsIn this retrospective, multicentre observational study conducted between 1 May and 12 June 2020 in 27 hospitals in Mexico and Ecuador, non-intubated patients with COVID-19 managed with AP or awake supine positioning (AS) were included to evaluate intubation and mortality risk in AP patients through logistic regression models; multivariable adjustment, propensity score analyses, and E-values were calculated to limit confounding. A CART model with cross-validation was also built. This study was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04407468

Results827 non-intubated patients with COVID-19 in the AP (n=505) and AS (n=322) groups were included for analysis. Less patients in the AP group required endotracheal intubation (23.6% vs 40.4%) or died (20% vs 37.9%). AP was a protective factor for intubation even after multivariable adjustment (OR=0.39, 95%CI:0.28-0.56, p<0.0001, E-value=2.01), which prevailed after propensity score analysis (OR=0.32, 95%CI:0.21-0.49, p<0.0001, E-value=2.21), and mortality (adjusted OR=0.38, 95%CI:0.25-0.57, p<0.0001, E-value=1.98). The main variables associated with PP failure in AP patients were age, lower SpO2/FiO2, and management with a non-rebreather mask. In the CART model, only two variables were used: SpO2/FiO2 (F 97.7, p<0.001) and PP (X2 50.5, p<0.001), with an overall percentage of 75.2%.

287,Title: Health and Healthcare Variables Associated with Italy's Excess Mortality during the First Wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: An Ecological Study.,"BackgroundHealthcare factors have strongly influenced the propagation of COVID-19. The present study aims to examine whether excess mortality during the first phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy was associated with health, healthcare, demographic, and socioeconomic indicators measured at a provincial level.

MethodsThe present ecological study concerns the raw number of deaths from Jan. 1 to Apr. 30, 2020 and the mean number of deaths in the same months of 2015 to 2019, per province. Information on socioeconomic factors and healthcare settings were extracted from the most recently updated databases on the ISTAT website. Two multilevel, multivariate models were constructed to test whether excess mortality was associated with the indicators across 107 provinces in Italy.

ResultsOn linear multilevel, multivariate analysis, AIDS mortality rate (p-value <0.05) correlates positively with excess mortality, while a higher density of General Practitioners (number of GPs per 1,000 population) is associated with lower excess mortality (p-value <0.05). After controlling for the diffusion of COVID-19 in each province, the significance of GP density increases (p-value <0.001) and the rate of hospitalization in long-term care wards is positively associated (p-value <0.05) with excess mortality.

288,A control framework to optimize public health policies in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic triggered substantial economic and social disruptions. Mitigation policies varied across countries based on resources, political conditions, and human behavior. In the absence of widespread vaccination able to induce herd immunity, strategies to coexist with the virus while minimizing risks of surges are paramount, which should work in parallel with reopening societies. To support these strategies, we present a predictive control system coupled with a nonlinear model able to optimize the level of policies to stop epidemic growth. We applied this system to study the unfolding of COVID-19 in Bahia, Brazil, also assessing the effects of varying population compliance. We show the importance of finely tuning the levels of enforced measures to achieve SARS-CoV-2 containment, with periodic interventions emerging as an optimal control strategy in the long-term.

289,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Years of Potential Life Lost Attributable to COVID-19 in the United States: An Analysis of 45 States and the District of Columbia,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the United States has disproportionately impacted communities of color across the country. Focusing on COVID-19-attributable mortality, we expand upon a national comparative analysis of years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to COVID-19 by race/ethnicity (Bassett et al., 2020), estimating percentages of total YPLL for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Asians, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives, contrasting them with their respective percent population shares, as well as age-adjusted YPLL rate ratios - anchoring comparisons to non-Hispanic Whites - in each of 45 states and the District of Columbia using data from the National Center for Health Statistics as of December 30, 2020. Using a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to quantify estimation uncertainty, our results reveal substantial racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19-attributable YPLL across states, with a prevailing pattern of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing disproportionately high and non-Hispanic Whites experiencing disproportionately low COVID-19-attributable YPLL. Furthermore, observed disparities are generally more pronounced when measuring mortality in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting the greater intensity of the disparities at younger ages. We also find substantial state-to-state variability in the magnitudes of the estimated racial/ethnic disparities, suggesting that they are driven in large part by social determinants of health whose degree of association with race/ethnicity varies by state.",Jay J Xu; Jarvis T Chen; Thomas R Belin; Ronald S Brookmeyer; Marc A Suchard; Christina M Ramirez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21249411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21249411,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True

291,Recombinant production of a functional SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Recombinant production of viral proteins can be used to produce vaccine antigens or reagents to identify antibodies in patient serum. Minimally, these proteins must be correctly folded and have appropriate post-translation modifications. Here we report the production of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the green algae Chlamydomonas. RBD fused to a fluorescent reporter protein accumulates as an intact protein when targeted for ER-Golgi retention or secreted from the cell, while a chloroplast localized version is truncated, lacking the amino terminus. The ER-retained RBD fusion protein was able to bind the human ACE2 receptor, the host target of SARS-CoV-2, and was specifically out-competed by mammalian cell-produced recombinant RBD, suggesting that the algae produced proteins are sufficiently post-translationally modified to act as authentic SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

294,Development and external validation of prognostic models for COVID-19 to support risk stratification in secondary care,"ObjectivesExisting UK prognostic models for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are limited by reliance on comorbidities, which are under-recorded in secondary care, and lack of imaging data among the candidate predictors. Our aims were to develop and externally validate novel prognostic models for adverse outcomes (death, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission) in UK secondary care; and externally validate the existing 4C score.

DesignCandidate predictors included demographic variables, symptoms, physiological measures, imaging, laboratory tests. Final models used logistic regression with stepwise selection.

SettingModel development was performed in data from University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB). External validation was performed in the CovidCollab dataset.

ParticipantsPatients with COVID-19 admitted to UHB January-August 2020 were included.

Main outcome measuresDeath and ITU admission within 28 days of admission.

Results1040 patients with COVID-19 were included in the derivation cohort; 288 (28%) died and 183 (18%) were admitted to ITU within 28 days of admission. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for mortality was 0.791 (95%CI 0.761-0.822) in UHB and 0.767 (95%CI 0.754-0.780) in CovidCollab; AUROC for ITU admission was 0.906 (95%CI 0.883-0.929) in UHB and 0.811 (95%CI 0.795-0.828) in CovidCollab. Models showed good calibration. Addition of comorbidities to candidate predictors did not improve model performance. AUROC for the 4C score in the UHB dataset was 0.754 (95%CI 0.721-0.786).

ConclusionsThe novel prognostic models showed good discrimination and calibration in derivation and external validation datasets, and outperformed the existing 4C score. The models can be integrated into electronic medical records systems to calculate each individual patients probability of death or ITU admission at the time of hospital admission. Implementation of the models and clinical utility should be evaluated.

Article SummaryO_ST_ABSStrengths and limitations of this studyC_ST_ABSO_LIWe developed novel prognostic models predicting mortality and ITU admission within 28 days of admission for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, using a large routinely collected dataset gathered at admission with a wide range of possible predictors (demographic variables, symptoms, physiological measures, imaging, laboratory test results).
C_LIO_LIThese novel models showed good discrimination and calibration in both derivation and external validation cohorts, and outperformed the existing ISARIC model and 4C score in the derivation dataset. We found that addition of comorbidities to the set of candidate predictors included in model derivation did not improve model performance.
C_LIO_LIIf integrated into hospital electronic medical records systems, the model algorithms will provide a predicted probability of mortality or ITU admission for each patient based on their individual data at, or close to, the time of admission, which will support clinicians decision making with regard to appropriate patient care pathways and triage. This information might also assist clinicians in explaining complex prognostic assessments and decisions to patients and their relatives.
C_LIO_LIA limitation of the study was that in the external validation cohort we were unable to examine all of the predictors included in the original full UHB model due to only a reduced set of candidate predictors being available in CovidCollab. Nevertheless, the reduced model performed well and the results suggest it may be applicable in a wide range of datasets where only a reduced set of predictor variables is available.
C_LIO_LIFurthermore, it was not possible to carry out stratified analysis by ethnicity as the UHB dataset contained too few patients in most of the strata, and no ethnicity data was available in the CovidCollab dataset.

295,Longitudinal analyses reveal age-specific immune correlates of COVID-19 severity,"Severe COVID-19 disproportionately impacts older individuals and those with comorbidities. It is estimated that approximately 80% of COVID-19 deaths are observed among individuals >65 years of age. However, the immunological underpinnings of severe COVID-19 in the aged have yet to be defined. This study captures the longitudinal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of young and aged patients with varying disease severity. Phenotypic transcriptional and functional examination of the peripheral mononuclear cells revealed age-, time, and disease severity-specific adaptations. Gene expression signatures within memory B cells suggest qualitative differences in the antibody responses in aged patients with severe disease. Examination of T cells showed profound lymphopenia, that worsened over time and correlated with lower levels of plasma cytokines important for T cell survival in aged patients with severe disease. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed augmented signatures of activation, exhaustion, cytotoxicity, and type-I interferon signaling in memory T cells and NK cells. Although hallmarks of a cytokine storm were evident in both groups, older individuals exhibited elevated levels of chemokines that mobilize inflammatory myeloid cells, notably in those who succumbed to disease. Correspondingly, we observed a re-distribution of DC and monocytes with severe disease that was accompanied by a rewiring towards a more regulatory phenotype. Several of these critical changes, such as the reduction of surface HLA-DR on myeloid cells, were reversed in young but not aged patients over time.

296,Impact of Prior Infection on Protection and Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Golden Hamsters,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over 100 million confirmed human infections, and 2 million more deaths globally since its emergence in the end of 2019. Several studies have shown that prior infection provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primate models. However, the effect of prior infection on blocking SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not clear. Here, we evaluated the impact of prior infection on protection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in golden hamsters. Our results showed that prior infection provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, but it was not sterizing immunity. The transmission experiment results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was efficiently transmitted from naive hamsters to prior infected hamsters by direct contact and airborne route, but not by indirect contact. Further, the virus was efficiently transmitted from prior infected hamsters to naive hamsters by direct contact, but not by airborne route and indirect contact. Surprisingly, the virus can be transmitted between prior infected hamsters by direct contact during a short period of early infection. Taken together, our study demonstrated that prior infected hamsters with good immunity can still be naturally re-infected, and the virus can be transmitted between prior infected hamsters and the naive through different transmission routes, implying the potential possibility of human re-infection and the risk of virus transmission between prior infected population and the healthy. Our study will help to calculate the herd immunity threshold more accurately, make more reasonable public health decisions, formulate an optimized population vaccination program, as well as aid the implementation of appropriate public health and social measures to control COVID-19.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.428920,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.428920,2021-01-30,2021-01-30,,False

We used a target emulation trial framework to study the causal effects of early (7 to 10 days post-intubation) versus late (>10 days) tracheotomy on time from tracheotomy to weaning, postoperative mortality, and tracheotomy complications. Cause-specific Cox models were used for the first two outcomes and Poisson regression for the third, all adjusted for potential confounders.

FindingsWe included 696 patients, of whom 142 (20{middle dot}4%) received early tracheotomy. Using late tracheotomy as the reference group, multivariable cause-specific analysis showed that early tracheotomy was associated with faster post-tracheotomy weaning (fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1{middle dot}31 [1{middle dot}02 to 1{middle dot}81]) without differences in mortality (fully adjusted HR [95% CI]: 0{middle dot}91 [0{middle dot}56 to 1{middle dot}47]) or intraoperative or postoperative complications (adjusted rate ratio [95% CI]: 0{middle dot}21 [0{middle dot}03 to 1{middle dot}57] and 1{middle dot}49 [0{middle dot}99 to 2{middle dot}24], respectively).

InterpretationEarly tracheotomy reduced post-tracheotomy weaning time, resulting in fewer mechanical ventilation days and shorter ICU stays, without changing complication or mortality rates. These results support early tracheotomy for COVID-19 patients when clinically indicated.

Research in contextO_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyThe optimal timing of tracheotomy for critically ill COVID-19 patients remains controversial. Existing guidelines and recommendations are based on limited experiences with SARS-CoV-1 and expert opinions derived from situations that differ from a pandemic outbreak. Most of the available guidance recommends late tracheotomy (>14 days), mainly due to the potential risk of infection for the surgical team and the high patient mortality rate observed early in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent publications have shown that surgical teams can safely perform tracheotomies for COVID-19 patients if they use adequate personal protective equipment. Early tracheotomy seems to reduce the length of invasive mechanical ventilation without increasing complications, which may release crucial intensive care unit (ICU) beds sooner.

The current recommendations do not suggest an optimal time for tracheotomy for COVID-19 patients, and no study has provided conclusions based on objective clinical parameters.

Added value of this studyThis is the first study aiming to establish the optimal timing for tracheotomy for critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The study prospectively recruited a large multicentre cohort of 696 patients under IMV due to COVID-19 and collected data about the severity of respiratory failure, clinical and ventilatory parameters, and whether patients need to be laid flat during their ICU stay (proned). The analysis focused on the duration of IMV, mortality, and complication rates. We used a prospective cohort study design to compare the  exposures of early (performed at day 7 to 10 after starting IMV) versus late (performed after day 10) tracheotomy and set the treatment decision time on the 7th day after orotracheal intubation.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe evidence suggests that tracheotomy within 10 days of starting COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation allows these patients to be removed from ventilation and discharged from ICU quicker than later tracheotomy, without added complications or increased mortality. This evidence may help to release ventilators and ICU beds more quickly during the pandemic.

298,Post-Mendelian genetic model in COVID-19,"Host genetics is an emerging theme in COVID-19 and few common polymorphisms and some rare variants have been identified, either by GWAS or candidate gene approach, respectively. However, an organic model is still missing. Here, we propose a new model that takes into account common and rare germline variants applied in a cohort of 1,300 Italian SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. Ordered logistic regression of clinical WHO grading on sex and age was used to obtain a binary phenotypic classification. Genetic variability from WES was synthesized in several boolean representations differentiated according to allele frequencies and genotype effect. LASSO logistic regression was used for extracting relevant genes. We defined about 100 common driver polymorphisms corresponding to classical ""threshold model"". Extracted genes were demonstrated to be gender specific. Stochastic rare more penetrant events on about additional 100 extracted genes, when occurred in a medium or severe background (common within the family), simulate Mendelian inheritance in 14% of subjects (having only 1 mutation) or oligogenic inheritance (in 10% having 2 mutations, in 11% having 3 mutations, etc).

The combined effect of common and rare results can be described as an integrated polygenic score computed as: (nseverity - nmildness) + F (mseverity - mmildness)

where n is the number of common driver genes, m is the number of driver rare variants and F is a factor for appropriately weighing the more powerful rare variants. We called the model ""post-Mendelian"". The model well describes the cohort, and patients are clustered in severe or mild by the integrated polygenic scores, the F factor being calibrated around 2, with a prediction capacity of 65% in males and 70% in females. In conclusion, this is the first comprehensive model interpreting host genetics in a holistic post-Mendelian manner. Further validations are needed in order to consolidate and refine the model which however holds true in thousands of SARS-CoV-2 Italian subjects.",Nicola Picchiotti; Elisa Benetti; Chiara Fallerini; Sergio Daga; Margherita Baldassarri; Francesca Fava; Kristina Zguro; Floriana Valentino; Gabriella Doddato; Annarita Giliberti; Rossella Tita; Sara Amitrano; Mirella Bruttini; Laura Di Sarno; Nicola Iuso; Diana Alaverdian; Giada Beligni; Susanna Croci; Ilaria Meloni; Anna Maria Pinto; Chiara Gabbi; Stefano Ceri; Antonio Esposito; Pietro Pinoli; Francis P.

299,Disentangling the association of hydroxychloroquine treatment with mortality in Covid-19 hospitalized patients through Hierarchical Clustering,"The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection is harshly debated, with observational and intervention studies reporting contrasting results.

To clarify the role of HCQ in Covid-19 patients, we carried out a retrospective observational study of 4,396 unselected patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Italy (February-May 2020). Patients characteristics were collected at entry, including age, sex, obesity, smoking status, blood parameters, history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases and medications in use. These were used to identify subtypes of patients with similar characteristics through hierarchical clustering based on Gower distance. Using multivariable Cox regressions, these clusters were then tested for association with mortality and modification of effect by treatment with HCQ.

We identified two clusters, one of 3,913 younger patients with lower circulating inflammation levels and better renal function, and one of 483 generally older and more comorbid subjects, more prevalently men and smokers. The latter group was at increased death risk adjusted by HCQ (HR[CI95%] = 3.80[3.08-4.67]), while HCQ showed an independent inverse association (0.51[0.43-0.61]), as well as a significant influence of cluster*HCQ interaction (p<0.001). This was driven by a differential association of HCQ with mortality between the high (0.89[0.65-1.22]) and the low risk cluster (0.46[0.39-0.54]). These effects survived adjustments for additional medications in use and were concordant with associations with disease severity and outcome.

These findings suggest a particularly beneficial effect of HCQ within low risk Covid-19 patients and may contribute clarifying the current controversy on HCQ efficacy in Covid-19 treatment.",Augusto Di Castelnuovo; Alessandro Gialluisi; - The COVID-19 RISK and Treatments (CORIST) Collaboration; Licia Iacoviello,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250238,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250238,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True

We tested 594 nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals with COVID-19 (RT-PCR cycle threshold [Ct] values [&le;]40) or non-COVID-19 (Ct values [&le;]40) diagnoses. RT-PCR positive samples were assigned to diagnostic, screening, or monitoring groups of testing. With a limit of detection of 1.2 x 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml, Lumipulse showed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 79.9% (155/194) and negative percent agreement of 99.3% (397/400), whereas PPAs were 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25 and 92.5% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30. By three groups, Lumipulse showed PPA of 87.0% (60/69), 81.1% (43/53), or 72.2% (52/72), respectively, whereas PPA was 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25, and was 94.4%, 80.0%, or 100% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively. RT-PCR positive samples were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA and, by three groups, testing showed that PPA was 63.8% (44/69), 62.3% (33/53), or 33.3% (24/72), respectively. PPAs dropped to 55.6%, 20.0%, or 41.7% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively. All 101 samples with a subgenomic RNA positive result had a Lumipulse assays antigen positive result, whereas only 54 (58.1%) of remaining 93 samples had a Lumipulse assays antigen positive result.

301,THE AIRBORNE CONTAGIOUSNESS OF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MITIGATION,"BackgroundThe infectious emission rate is a critical input parameter for airborne contagion models, but data are limited due to reliance on estimates from chance superspreading events. A predictive estimation approach for the quanta emission rate (ERq) was recently proposed for SARS-CoV-2 using the droplet volume concentration of various expiratory activities. This study assesses the strength of the approach and uses novel predictive estimates of ERq to compare the contagiousness of respiratory pathogens.

MethodsWe applied the predictive approach to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, measles virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus, seasonal influenza virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and compared ERq estimates to values reported in literature. We calculated infection risk in a prototypical classroom and barracks to assess the relative ability of ventilation to mitigate airborne transmission.

ResultsOur median standing and speaking ERq estimate for SARS-CoV-2 (2.6 quanta hour (h)-1) is similar to active, untreated TB (3.1 h-1), higher than seasonal influenza (0.17 quanta h-1), and lower than measles virus (15 quanta h-1). We calculated event reproduction numbers above 1 for SARS-CoV-2, measles virus, and untreated TB in both the classroom and barracks for an activity level of standing and speaking at low, medium and high ventilation rates of 2.3, 6.6 and 14 liters per second per person, respectively.

ConclusionsOur predictive ERq estimates are consistent with the range of values reported over decades of research. In congregate settings, current ventilation standards are unlikely to control the spread of viruses with upper quartile ERq values above 10 quanta h-1, such as SARS-CoV-2, indicating the need for additional control measures.",Alex Mikszewski; Luca Stabile; Giorgio Buonanno; Lidia Morawska,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250580,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250580,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
302,Evaluation of spike protein antigens for SARS-CoV-2 serology,"BackgroundSpike protein domains are being used in various serology-based assays to detect prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there has been limited comparison of human antibody titers against various spike protein antigens among COVID-19 infected patients.

MethodsWe compared four spike proteins (RBD, S1, S2 and a stabilized spike trimer (ST)) representing commonly used antigens for their reactivity to human IgG antibodies using indirect ELISA in serum from COVID-19 patients and pre-2020 samples. ST ELISA was also compared against the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA test. Further, we estimated time appropriate IgG and IgA seropositivity rates in COVID-19 patients using a panel of sera samples collected longitudinally from the day ofonset of symptoms (DOS).

ResultsAmong the four spike antigens tested, the ST demonstrated the highest sensitivity (86.2%; 95% CI: 77.8-91.7%), while all four antigens showed high specificity to COVID-19 sera (94.7-96.8%). 13.8% (13/94) of the samples did not show seroconversion in any of the four antigen-based assays. In a double-blinded head-to-head comparison, ST based IgG ELISA displayed a better sensitivity (87.5%, 95%CI: 76.4-93.8%) than the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA (67.9%, 95% CI: 54.8-78.6%). Further, in ST-based assays, we found 48% and 50% seroconversion in the first six days (from DOS) for IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively, which increased to 84% (IgG) and 85% (IgA) for samples collected [&ge;]22 days DOS.

ConclusionsComparison of spike antigens demonstrates that spike trimer protein is a superior option as an ELISA antigen for COVID-19 serology.

303,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in school settings during the second wave in Berlin, Germany: a cross-sectional study","BackgroundSchool attendance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is intensely debated. Modelling studies suggest that school closures contribute to community transmission reduction. However, data among school-attending students and staff are scarce. In November 2020, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infections and seroreactivity in 24 randomly selected school classes and connected households in Berlin, Germany.

MethodsStudents and school staff were examined, oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples collected, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and IgG antibodies detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Household members performed self-swabs. Individual and institutional infection prevention and control measures were assessed. Classes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and connected household members were re-tested after one week.

Findings1119 participants were examined, including 177 primary and 175 secondary school students, 142 staff, and 625 household members. Participants reported mainly cold symptoms (19{middle dot}4%). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in eight of 24 classes affecting each 1-2 individuals. Infection prevalence was 2{middle dot}7% (95%CI; 1{middle dot}2-5{middle dot}0%; 9/338), 1{middle dot}4% (0{middle dot}2-5{middle dot}1%; 2/140), and 2{middle dot}3% (1{middle dot}3-3{middle dot}8%; 14/611) among students, staff and household members, respectively, including quarantined persons. Six of nine infected students were asymptomatic. Prevalence increased with inconsistent facemask use in school, way to school on foot, and case-contacts outside school. IgG antibodies were detected in 2{middle dot}0% (0{middle dot}8-4{middle dot}1%; 7/347), 1{middle dot}4% (0{middle dot}2-5{middle dot}0%; 2/141) and 1{middle dot}4% (0{middle dot}6-2{middle dot}7%; 8/576), respectively. For three of nine households with infection(s) detected at cross-sectional assessment, origin in school seemed possible. After one week, no school-related, secondary infections appeared in affected classes; the attack rate in connected households was 1{middle dot}1%.

InterpretationThese data suggest that school attendance under preventive measures is feasible, provided their rigorous implementation. In balancing threats and benefits of open versus closed schools during the pandemic, parents and society need to consider possible spill-overs into their households. Deeper insight is needed into the infection risks due to being a schoolchild as compared to attending school.

304,The E484K mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reduces but does not abolish neutralizing activity of human convalescent and post-vaccination sera.,"One year in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the first vaccines are being rolled out under emergency use authorizations. It is of great concern that newly emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can escape antibody-mediated protection induced by previous infection or vaccination through mutations in the spike protein. The glutamate (E) to Lysine (K) substitution at position 484 (E484K) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is present in the rapidly spreading variants of concern belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. We performed in vitro microneutralization assays with both the USA-WA1/2020 virus and a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1/2020 except for the E484K mutation introduced in the spike RBD. We selected 34 sera from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate [N=11] or strong positive [N=11]). In addition, we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K rSARS-CoV-2 (vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold, moderate IgG: 4.2 fold and high IgG: 2.6 fold) compared to USA-WA1/2020. For some of the convalescent donor sera with low or moderate IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the drop in neutralization efficiency resulted in neutralization ID50 values similar to negative control samples, with low or even absence of neutralization of the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. However, human sera with high neutralization titers against the USA-WA1/2020 strain were still able to neutralize the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by vaccination to enhance protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two vaccine doses may be needed for induction of high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. Postponing the second vaccination is suggested by some public health authorities in order to provide more individuals with a primer vaccination. Our data suggests that this may leave vaccinees less protected against newly emerging variants.",Sonia Jangra; Chengjin Ye; Raveen Rathnasinghe; Daniel Stadlbauer; - Personalized Virology Initiative (PVI) Study Group; Florian Krammer; Viviana Simon; Luis Martinez-Sobrido; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Michael Schotsaert,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250543,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250543,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
305,Covid-19 positive test cycle threshold trends predict covid-19 mortality in Rhode Island,"The cycle thresholds (Cts) at which reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) tests for covid-19 become positive are intimately associated with both viral load, and covid-19 infectiousness (i.e., ability to culture live virus). Clinical data indicate lower Cts--and hence larger viral loads--independently predict greater covid-19 mortality when patients are hospitalized for symptomatic covid-19 pneumonia. We merged public covid-19 mortality data from the Rhode Island Department of Health with a de-identified dataset of n=5036 positive rtPCR test Cts from the Rhode Island Department of Health State Laboratory to explore the potential relationship between positive covid-19 test Ct distribution trends, and covid-19 mortality in the state of Rhode Island, from March through early to mid-June, 2020. Mean daily covid-19 positive test Ct data were compiled, and 7-day rolling average covid-19 mortality was offset by 21-days, given the lag between infection and death. We divided the Ct data into three strata, >32, 28-32, and <28, which were operationally defined as ""not infectious,"" ""maybe infectious,"" and ""infectious,"" respectively. Between late March and June, mean daily Ct values rose linearly (R-squared=0.789) so that by early June, as the covid-19 pandemic ebbed in severity, all means reached the noninfectious (Ct >32) range. Most notably, this May-June trend for Cts was accompanied by a marked, steady decline in Rhode Islands daily covid-19 mortality. Our results suggest that monitoring, and public reporting of mean population covid-19 test Cts over time is warranted to gauge the vacillations of covid-19 outbreak severity, including covid-19 mortality trends.",Andrew Bostom; Charles B.

306,SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and subsequent infection risk in healthy young adults: a prospective cohort study,"BackgroundThe risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subsequent infection among seropositive young adults was studied prospectively.

MethodsThe study population comprised 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits. Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants.

FindingsAmong 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralizing titers were detected in 45 of 54 (83.3%) uninfected and in 6 of 19 (31.6%) infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<.0001).

InterpretationSeropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings may be relevant for optimization of mass vaccination strategies.

307,Stringency of the containment measures in response to COVID-19 inversely correlates with the overall disease occurrence over the epidemic wave,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were the only viable choice to mitigate or suppress transmission of COVID-19 in the absence of efficient and safe vaccines. Moreover, the importance of some NPIs is likely to remain in the future, at least in specific settings, in which the limited vaccination coverage and the high rate of contacts would enable further disease transmission. Nonetheless, the benefits of NPIs have been questioned with respect to their effectiveness and societal costs. In this study of 28 European countries during the first wave of epidemic we demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between the stringency of adopted containment measures and cumulative incidences of the confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our results indicate that early implementation of the stringent containment measures prior to detection of the first confirmed case, and rapid ramp-up of containment stringency after the first case was diagnosed, were instrumental for lowering the number of COVID-19 cases during the epidemic wave. The impact of delayed adoption of containment measures could not be fully attenuated by later adoption of even more stringent community containment.",Roman Mezencev; Cyril Klement,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250501,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250501,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
308,Reduction of respiratory syncytial virus burden of disease observed in primary care diagnosis of children under 5 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic: a time-series analysis using routinely collected data from primary care electronic health records in Catalonia (Spain).,"BackgroundGreat reductions of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children were observed during the 2020 Southern hemisphere winter.

AimTo describe trends of RSV related disease in children in the Northern hemisphere and to propose a low cost clinical surveillance system based on primary care electronic health records (EHR).

MethodsTime series analysis of RSV-related disease and virus laboratory-confirmations in children under 5 years old from 1 September 2009 to 16 January 2021. We collected RSV diagnoses from primary care EHR in Catalonia (Spain). We compared the trend of RSV in the season 2020-2021 with that in the previous seasons. We estimated the expected RSV cases with data from 2009 to 2018 using a time series regression adjusted by seasonality. We used the same method to estimate the expected RSV laboratory-confirmations as a sensitivity analysis.

ResultsIn previous seasons, RSV-related disease peaks in Catalonia during the weeks 52 and 53. However in the 2020-2021 period, we observed a reduction of 87.6% (95% CI: 82.7% to 90.3%) in RSV-related disease from october 2020 compared to the expected.

309,Risk perception of COVID-19 and its socioeconomic correlates in the United States: A social media analysis,"Social media analysis provides a new approach to monitoring and understanding risk perceptions regarding COVID-19 over time. Our current understandings of risk perceptions regarding COVID-19 do not disentangle the three dimensions of risk perceptions (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and negative emotion) over a long enough timeframe to cover different pandemic phases. The impact of social determinants of health factors on COVID-19-related risk perceptions over time is also not clear. To address these two knowledge gaps, we extracted tweets regarding COVID-19-related risk perceptions and developed index indicators for three dimensions of risk perceptions based on over 297 million geotagged tweets posted by over 3.5 million Twitter users from January to October 2020 in the United States. We also examined correlations between index indicator scores and county-level social determinants of health factors. The three domains of risk perceptions demonstrate different trajectories. Perceived severity kept climbing throughout the whole study period. Perceived susceptibility and negative emotion declined and remained stable at a lower level after peaking on March 11 (WHO named COVID-19 a global pandemic). Attention on risk perceptions was not exactly in accordance with epidemic trends of COVID-19 (cases, deaths). Users from socioeconomically vulnerable counties showed lower attention on perceived severity and susceptibility of COVID-19 than those from wealthier counties. Examination of trends in tweets regarding the multiple domains of risk perceptions throughout stages of the COVID-19 pandemic can help policy makers frame in-time, tailored, and appropriate responses to prevent viral spread and encourage preventive behavior uptake in United States.",Shan Qiao; Zhenlong Li; Chen Liang; Xiaoming Li; Caroline Ann Rudisill,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250654,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250654,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True

Almost 5,000 respondents age 18-81 years who completed the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) battery reported high rates of depression symptoms with more than 40% reporting levels that indicate risk of moderate depression and 25% indicating risk of severe depression. There is a very steep age gradient with the highest levels reported by the youngest respondents of whom over 40% are at risk of severe depression. Symptoms are worse among those who report the demands of work often interfere with family responsibilities but these pressures neither explain the high reported rates nor the steep age gradient.

311,Multinational Prevalence of Neurological Phenotypes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,"OBJECTIVENeurological complications can worsen outcomes in COVID-19. We defined the prevalence of a wide range of neurological conditions among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in geographically diverse multinational populations.

METHODSUsing electronic health record (EHR) data from 348 participating hospitals across 6 countries and 3 continents between January and September 2020, we performed a cross-sectional study of hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test, both with and without severe COVID-19. We assessed the frequency of each disease category and 3-character International Classification of Disease (ICD) code of neurological diseases by countries, sites, time before and after admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19 severity.

RESULTSAmong the 35,177 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was increased prevalence of disorders of consciousness (5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7%-7.8%, pFDR<.001) and unspecified disorders of the brain (8.1%, 95%CI: 5.7%-10.5%, pFDR<.001), compared to pre-admission prevalence. During hospitalization, patients who experienced severe COVID-19 status had 22% (95%CI: 19%-25%) increase in the relative risk (RR) of disorders of consciousness, 24% (95%CI: 13%-35%) increase in other cerebrovascular diseases, 34% (95%CI: 20%-50%) increase in nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage, 37% (95%CI: 17%-60%) increase in encephalitis and/or myelitis, and 72% (95%CI: 67%-77%) increase in myopathy compared to those who never experienced severe disease.

312,Is vitamin D deficiency associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe?,"ObjectiveCOVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 80 million people from 218 countries as of December 2020. At the same time, vitamin D deficiency seems to be prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Hence, the association between the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection and mortality among European countries was examined.

DesignA case series and recent literature review study

SettingsInformation on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in each country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed(R) database. As of December, 23rd 2020, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per million population were extracted from the Worldometer website, whereas the latitude of each country was taken from the CSGNetwork website. The association between both vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots.

ParticipantsEuropean Countries-Populations

ResultsThe range of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries was 6.9-75.1%, with most countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their population. Significant positive correlations were observed between COVID-19 infections (r=0.82; p<0.001) and mortalities (r=0.53; p=0.05) per million population with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Most of the high latitude countries showed lower rates of COVID-19 infections and mortalities compared to middle latitude countries.

ConclusionPrevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 among European countries. Thus, it is an important parameter to be considered when implementing preventive measures to mitigate the mortality rate of COVID-19.",Dimitra Rafailia Bakaloudi; Michail Chourdakis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250673,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250673,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
313,"Ownership and COVID-19 in care homes for older people: A living systematic review of outbreaks, infections, and mortalities","BackgroundThe adult social care sector is being increasingly outsourced to for-profit providers, but the impacts of privatisation on service quality and resident outcomes are unclear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for-profit providers have been accused of failing their residents by prioritising profits over care, prevention, and caution, which has been reported to result in a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infections and deaths in for-profit care homes. Although many of these reports are anecdotal or based on news reports, there is a growing body of academic research investigating ownership variation across COVID-19 outcomes, which has not been systematically appraised and synthesised.

ObjectivesTo identify, appraise, and synthesise the available research on ownership variation in COVID-19 outcomes (outbreaks, infections, deaths, shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff) across for-profit, public, and non-profit care homes for older people, and to update our findings as new research becomes available.

DesignLiving systematic review.

MethodsThis review was prospectively registered with Prospero (CRD42020218673). We searched 17 databases and performed forward and backward citation tracking of all included studies. Search results were screened and reviewed in duplicate. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed in duplicate according to the COSMOS-E guidance. The results were synthesised according to RoB, model adjustment, and country context and visualised using harvest plots.

ResultsTwenty-eight studies across five countries were included, with 75% of included studies conducted in the Unites States. For-profit ownership was not consistently associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 outbreaks across included studies. However, there was compelling evidence of worse COVID-19 outcomes following an outbreak; with for-profit care homes having higher rates of accumulative infections and deaths. For-profit providers were also associated with shortages in PPE, which may have contributed to the higher incidence of infections and deaths.

Chain affiliation was often found to be correlated with higher risk of outbreaks, but not consistently associated with an elevated number of deaths and infections. Private equity ownership was not consistently associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes.

ConclusionFor-profit status was a consistent risk factor for higher cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths. Thus, ownership among providers may be a key modifiable factor which can be regulated to improve health outcomes in vulnerable populations and reduce health disparities.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing long-term effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting long-term COVID-19 published before 1st of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, although the study protocol was not registered. A total of 18,251 publications were identified, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 14 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years. It was estimated that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%). All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13). In order to have a better understanding, future studies need to stratify by sex, age, previous comorbidities, severity of COVID-19 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), and duration of each symptom.

317,A systematic review and meta-analysis on the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19,"BackgroundThis systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to evaluate the therapeutic benefits and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) in treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated health complications.

MethodsThe electronic search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (RCTs), and Google scholar databases to identify the retrospective observational reports. The studies published from 01 January 2020 to 30th September 2020 involving comparison of TCZ group with SOC/control treatment group were included. The studies included in this work involve RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 (Population), having tocilizumab and corresponding SOC/control as interventions (Intervention), comparison between tocilizumab versus SOC/control (Comparison) for the parameter of interest. Mortality, incidences of ICU admission, need of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay in the hospital (LOS), and length of stay in the ICU (LOS-ICU), and the incidences of super-infection, bacteraemia, fugleman, pneumonia, and pulmonary thrombosis were evaluated as the primary outcomes. The comparison will be between TCZ versus standard of care (SOC)/placebo.

ResultsBased on the inclusion criteria there were 24 retrospective studies involving 5686 subjects were included. The outcomes of the meta-analysis have revealed that the TCZ has reduced the mortality (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H), random effects risk difference (RE-RD) of - 0.11 (-0.18 to -0.04), at 95% CI, p = 0.001, I2 = 88%) and increased the incidences of super-infections (M-H, RE-Risk ratio (RR) of 1.49 (1.13 to 1.96) at 95% CI, p=0.004, I2 = 47%). However, there is no significant difference in ICU admissions rate (M-H, RE-RD of -0.06 (-0.23 to 0.12) at 95% CI, p=0.54, I2 = 93%), need of MV (M-H, RE-RD of 0.00 (-0.06 to 0.07) at 95% CI, p=0.96, I2 = 74%), LOS (Inverse variance (IV): -2.86 (-0.91 to 3.38) at 95% CI, p=0.37, I2 = 100%), LOS-ICU (IV: -3.93 (-12.35 to 4.48) at 95% CI, p=0.36, I2 = 100%), and incidences of pulmonary thrombosis (M-H, fixed effect odds ratio (FE-OR) of 1.01 (0.45 to 2.26) at 95% CI, p=0.99, I2 = 0%) compared to SOC/control.

ConclusionThis meta-analysis was performed using retrospective clinical reports on the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 and based on the outcomes of the meta-analysis we can conclude that administration of TCZ would reduce the risk of mortality, and however there is no much difference observed between the TCZ and SOC/control groups in other parameters such as ICU admission rate, need of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay (ICU and Non-ICU). On the other hand, TCZ treated subjects possess higher chances of super-infections and pneumonia compared with SOC/control group.

318,Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Sero-Positivity in a Large Longitudinal Sero-Surveillance Cohort: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,"BackgroundEstimating population prevalence and incidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to formulate public health recommendations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease.

MethodsWe examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership.

FindingsAmong participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status.

InterpretationThe short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies. The impact of the large number of minimally symptomatic COVID-19 cases with only a brief antibody response on population immunity remains to be determined.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in context

Evidence before this studyPrevious longitudinal studies of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 suggest that people with less severe disease have a more rapid decline of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies than people with severe disease. However, these data come from small laboratory-based investigations or studies of convenience samples identified based on symptomatic disease.

Added value of this studyThis study provides extensive longitudinal serologic follow-up in a large number of people with serologic evidence of prior infection who had little or no symptoms based on active daily symptom surveillance.

Implications of the available evidenceThe data indicate that serologic evidence of prior infection in minimally symptomatic people is fleeting, suggesting that cross-sectional sero-surveys have under-estimated the true prevalence of prior infection in populations. The data highlight the challenge of determining transmission dynamics and long-term immunity in asymptomatic cases which likely represents an even larger fraction of all cases of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than previously presumed.

319,SARS-CoV-2 in Ivory Coast: serosurveillance survey among mines workers,"BackgroundEight months after the detection of the first COVID-19 case in Africa, 1,262,476 cases have been reported in African countries compared to 72 million worldwide. The real burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in West Africa is not clearly defined. The aim of the study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in half of the 3,380 workers of several mining companies operating in two mines in the Ivory Coast and having its headquarters in the economic capital Abidjan.

MethodsFrom 15th July to 13th October 2020, a voluntary serological test campaign was performed in the 3 sites where the companies operate: two mines, and the headquarters in Abidjan.We performed a COVID-PRESTO rapid test for the detection of IgG and IgM on capillary blood. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent sociodemographic characteristics associated with a higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate.

ResultsA total of 1,687 subjects were tested. 91% were male (n= 1,536) and mean age was 37 years old. The overall crude seroprevalence rate was 25.1% (n=422), but differing significantly between different sites, rising from 13.6% (11.2%-16.1%) in mine A to 34.4% (31.1%-37.7%) in mine B and 34.7% (26.2%-43.2%) in Abidjan. Non-resident workers in mines had a significantly lower prevalence rate than those living full-time in mines. Seroprevalence was 26.5% in natives of the Ivory Coast, while people coming from countries other than Africa were less likely to be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Among the 422 positive subjects, 74 reported mild symptoms in the three previous months and one was hospitalized for a severe COVID-19 infection.

ConclusionThe prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among mine workers in Ivory Coast is high. The low morbidity observed has probably led to an underestimation of the burden of this infection in West Africa. The high prevalence reported in subjects living in Abidjan, who have not any close contact with mine workers, may be indicative of the real seroprevalence in the Ivory Coast capital.",Jean- Marie Milleliri; Daouda Coulibaly; Blaise Nyobe; Jean-Loup Rey; Franck Lamontagne; Laurent Hocqueloux; Susanna Giache; Antoine Valery; thierry prazuck,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21249186,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21249186,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True

However, a minority of infected individuals develop severe respiratory symptoms. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible HLA alleles and clinical markers for the early identification of severe COVID-19 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

322,A Rapid and Low-Cost protocol for the detection of B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 by using SYBR Green-Based RT-qPCR,"BackgroundThe new SARS-CoV-2 variant VUI (202012/01), identified recently in the United Kingdom (UK), exhibits a higher transmissibility rate compared to other variants, and a reproductive number 0.4 higher. In the UK, scientists were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the rise of false negative results for the spike (S) target using a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit).

MethodsTo control and study the current coronavirus pandemic, it is important to develop a rapid and low-cost molecular test to identify the aforementioned variant. In this work, we designed primer sets specific to SARS-CoV-2 variant VUI (202012/01) to be used by SYBR Green-based RT-PCR. These primers were specifically designed to confirm the deletion mutations {Delta}69/{Delta}70 in the spike and the {Delta}106/{Delta}107/{Delta}108 in the NSP6 gene. We studied 20 samples from positive patients, 16 samples displayed an S-negative profile (negative for S target and positive for N and ORF1ab targets) and four samples with S, N and ORF1ab positive profile.

323,A prediction model for COVID-19 prevalence based on demographic and healthcare parameters in Iran,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the greatest threat to global health in only a matter of months. Iran struggling with COVID-19 coincidence with Nowruz vacations has led to horrendous consequences for both people and the public health workforce. Modeling approaches have been proved to be highly advantageous in taking appropriate actions in the early stages of the pandemic. To this date, no study has been conducted to model the disease to investigate the disease, especially after travel restrictions in Iran. In this study, we exploited the opportunities that Artificial neural networks offer to investigate contributing factors of early-stage coronavirus spread via generating a model to predict daily confirmed cases in Iran. We collected publicly available data of confirmed cases in 24 provinces from April 4, 2020, to May 2, 2020, with a list of explanatory factors. The factors were checked separately for any linear associations and to train and validate a multilayer perceptron network. The accuracy of the models was evaluated, the R2 scores were 0.842 for population distribution, 0.822 for health index, and 0.864 for the population in the provinces. Our results suggest the significant impact of the mentioned factors on disease spread in the time of travel restrictions when the vacation ended. Accordingly, this information can be implicated in assessing the risk of epidemics and future policy makings in this area.",parimah Sadat Emadi Safavi; Karim Rahimian; Alireza Doustmohammadi; Mahla Safari Dastjerdei; Ahmadreza Rasouli; Javad Zahiri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250551,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
324,The World Mortality Dataset: Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the recent average, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no central, frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 77 countries, openly available as the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more. Averaging across the entire dataset suggests that the worlds COVID-19 death toll may be at least 1.6 times higher than the reported number of confirmed deaths.",Ariel Karlinsky; Dmitry Kobak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250604,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250604,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
325,Beyond the new normal: assessing the feasibility of vaccine-based elimination of SARS-CoV-2,"As the COVID-19 pandemic drags into its second year, there is hope on the horizon, in the form of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which promise disease elimination and a return to pre-pandemic normalcy. In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis. Our findings suggest that vaccines that do not prevent infection will allow extensive endemic SARS-CoV-2 spread upon a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions. Vaccines that only reduce symptomatic COVID-19 or mortality will fail to mitigate serious COVID-19 mortality risks, particularly in the over-65 population, likely resulting in hundreds of thousands of US deaths on a yearly basis. Our modeling points to the possibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 elimination with high population-level compliance and a vaccine that is highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, vaccine-mediated reduction of transmission is critical for elimination, and in order for partially-effective vaccines to play a positive role in SARS-CoV-2 elimination, other stackable (complementary) interventions must be deployed simultaneously.",Madison Stoddard; Sharanya Sarkar; Ryan P.

326,Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose,"COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States require two doses, administered three to four weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with the rise of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, have sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy against disease following the first dose, vaccine efficacy against infection, and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines with 80% efficacy following the first dose, a delay of 9-12 weeks could enhance the program effectiveness and prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to a 4-week interval between the doses. However, for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with demonstrated efficacy of 52% after the first dose, there was no clear advantage for delaying the second dose beyond the 3-week tested schedule, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose as well as vaccine efficacy against infection in order to determine the optimal time interval between the two doses.",Seyed M.

327,"The effect of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 on symptomatology, re-infection and transmissibility","The new SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 was identified in December 2020 in the South-East of England, and rapidly increased in frequency and geographic spread. While there is some evidence for increased transmissibility of this variant, it is not known if the new variant presents with variation in symptoms or disease course, or if previously infected individuals may become reinfected with the new variant. Using longitudinal symptom and test reports of 36,920 users of the Covid Symptom Study app testing positive for COVID-19 between 28 September and 27 December 2020, we examined the association between the regional proportion of B.1.1.7 and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility. We found no evidence for changes in reported symptoms, disease severity and disease duration associated with B.1.1.7. We found a likely reinfection rate of around 0.7% (95% CI 0.6-0.8), but no evidence that this was higher compared to older strains. We found an increase in R(t) by a factor of 1.35 (95% CI 1.02-1.69). Despite this, we found that regional and national lockdowns have reduced R(t) below 1 in regions with very high proportions of B.1.1.7.",Mark S Graham; Carole H Sudre; Anna May; Michela Antonelli; Benjamin Murray; Thomas Varsavsky; Kerstin Klaser; Liane Dos Santos Canas; Erika Molteni; Marc Modat; David Alden Drew; Long Alden Nguyen; Lorenzo Polidori; Somesh Selvachandran; Christina Hu; Joan Capdevila Pujol; - The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium; Alexander Hammers; Andrew T Chan; Jonathan Wolf; Timothy Spector; Claire Steves; Sebastien Ourselin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250680,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250680,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
328,COVID-19 mortality: positive correlation with cloudiness and sunlight but no correlation with latitude in Europe,"We systematically investigated an ongoing debate about the possible correlation between SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemiological outcomes and solar exposure in European countries, in the period of March - August 2020. For each country, we correlated its mortality data with solar insolation (watt/square metre) and objective sky cloudiness (as cloud fraction) derived from satellite weather data. We found a positive correlation between the monthly mortality rate and the overall cloudiness in that month (Pearsons r(35)=.779, P<.001; linear model fitting the data, adjusted R2 =0.59). In Europe, in colder months, approximately 34% to 58% of the variance in COVID-19 mortality/million appears to be predicted by the cloudiness fraction of the sky, except in August in which only [~]15% of the variance was explained. The data show a low, negative correlation between the mortality rate with the overall insolation received by the country area in that entire month (Pearsons r(35)=-0.622, P<.001). Additionally, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the mortality and the latitude of the countries when the ""latitude of a country"" was precisely defined as the average landmass location (country centroid). The unexpected correlation found between cloudiness and mortality could perhaps be explained by the following: 1) heavy cloudiness is linked with colder outdoor surfaces, which might aid virus survival; 2) reduced evaporation rate; 3) moderate pollution may be linked to both cloudiness and mortality; and 4) large-scale behavioural changes due to cloudiness (which perhaps drives people to spend more time indoors and thus facilitates indoor contamination).",Secil Omer; Adrian Iftime; Victor Andrei Burcea,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250658,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250658,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
329,The Experience of Two Independent Schools with In-Person Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BACKGROUNDIn 2020, U.S schools closed due to SARS-CoV-2 but their role in transmission was unknown. In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing.

METHODSSARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing.

RESULTSOver the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School-B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1200 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63(91%) were not associated with school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-Thanksgiving. In 6/7 clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28 identified cases and was traced to an off-campus party. There was no transmission from students to staff.

CONCLUSIONSAlthough school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID-19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to re-opening.",Darria Long Gillespie; Lauren Ancel Meyers; Michael Lachmann; Stephen C Redd; Jonathan M Zenilman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250065,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250065,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
330,Induction of labour during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey of impact on practice in the UK,"BackgroundInduction of labour (IOL) is one of the most commonly performed interventions in maternity care, with outpatient cervical ripening increasingly offered as an option for women undergoing IOL. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the context of practice and the option of returning home for cervical ripening may now assume greater significance. This work aimed to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed practice around IOL in the UK.

MethodWe used an online questionnaire to survey senior obstetricians and midwives at all 156 UK NHS Trusts and Boards that currently offer maternity services. Responses were analysed to produce descriptive statistics, with free text responses analysed using a conventional content analysis approach.

FindingsResponses were received from 92 of 156 UK Trusts and Boards, a 59% response rate. Many Trusts and Boards reported no change to their IOL practice, however 23% reported change in methods used for cervical ripening; 28% a change in criteria for home cervical ripening; 28% stated that more women were returning home during cervical ripening; and 24% noted changes to womens response to recommendations for IOL. Much of the change was reported as happening in response to attempts to minimise hospital attendance and restrictions on birth partners accompanying women.

ConclusionsThe pandemic has changed practice around induction of labour, although this varied significantly between NHS Trusts and Boards. There is a lack of formal evidence to support decision-making around outpatient cervical ripening: the basis on which changes were implemented and what evidence was used to inform decisions is not clear.",Mairi Harkness; Cassandra Yuill; Helen Cheyne; Sarah Stock; Christine McCourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250521,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250521,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
331,The prevalence of olfactory dysfunction and its associated factors in patients with COVID-19 infection,"ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions, mainly, anosmia and to identify its associated factors in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Study designA hospital-based prospective observational cohort study

SettingA COVID dedicated hospital, Square Hospitals Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh.

MethodsWe collected patients information including laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 test results. We used Pearson Chi-square test and logistic regression model to assess the associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and olfactory outcomes.

ResultsOut of 600 COVID-19 positive patients, 38.7% were diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction. Our analyses showed that patients age, smoking status, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, asthenia, and nausea or vomiting were significantly associated with the anosmia. We observed the risk of developing anosmia was greater in younger patients than in older patients, and this risk decreased as age increased [odds ratio (OR) range for different age groups: 1.26 to 1.08]. Smoking patients were 1.73 times more likely to experience anosmia than non-smoking patients [OR=1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-2.98]. In addition, patients complained asthenia had a significantly double risk of developing the anosmia [OR = 1.96, CI = 1.23-3.06].

ConclusionsOur study shows that about 39% of patients diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction. Patients age, smoking status, and asthenia are significantly positively associated with the anosmia. Since anosmia can be a significant marker for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we suggest regular screening of olfactory dysfunction in patients with early symptoms of COVID-19, particularly younger patients, smoker, and complained asthenia.",Md.

332,Self-Reported Mask Wearing Greatly Exceeds Directly Observed Use: Urgent Need for Policy Intervention in Kenya,"BackgroundMany countries in sub-Saharan Africa have so far avoided large outbreaks of COVID-19, perhaps due to the strict lockdown measures that were imposed early in the pandemic. Yet the harsh socio-economic consequences of the lockdowns have led many governments to ease the restrictions in favor of less stringent mitigation strategies. In the absence of concrete plans for widespread vaccination, masks remain one of the few tools available to low-income populations to avoid the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the foreseeable future.

MethodsWe compare mask use data collected through self-reports from phone surveys and direct observations in public spaces from population-representative samples in Ugunja subcounty, a rural setting in Western Kenya. We examine mask use in different situations and compare mask use by gender, age, location, and the riskiness of the activity

FindingsWe assess mask use data from 1,960 phone survey respondents and 9,549 direct observations. While only 12% of people admitted in phone interviews to not wearing a mask in public, 90% of people we observed did not have a mask visible (77.7% difference, 95% CI 0.742, 0.802). Self-reported mask use was significantly higher than observed mask use in all scenarios (i.e. in the village, in the market, on public transportation).

InterpretationWe find limited compliance with the national government mask mandate in Kenya using directly observed data, but high rates of self-reported mask use. This vast gap suggests that people are aware that mask use is socially desirable, but in practice they do not adopt this behavior.

Focusing public policy efforts on improving adoption of mask use via education and behavioral interventions may be needed to improve compliance.

333,Passing the Test: A model-based analysis of safe school-reopening strategies,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has induced historic educational disruptions. In December 2020, at least two-thirds of US public school students were not attending full-time in-person education. The Biden Administration has expressed that reopening schools is a priority.

ObjectiveTo compare risks of SARS-COV-2 transmission in schools across different school-based prevention strategies and levels of community transmission.

DesignWe developed an agent-based network model to simulate transmission in elementary and high school communities, including home, school, and inter-household interactions.

SettingWe parameterized school structure based on average US classrooms, with elementary schools of 638 students and high schools of 1,451 students. We varied daily community incidence from 1 to 100 cases per 100,000 population.

Patients (or Participants)We simulated students, faculty/staff, and adult household members.

InterventionsWe evaluated isolation of symptomatic individuals, quarantine of an infected individuals contacts, reduced class sizes, alternative schedules, staff vaccination, and weekly asymptomatic screening.

MeasurementsWe projected transmission among students, staff and families during one month following introduction of a single infection into a school. We also calculated the number of infections expected for a typical 8-week quarter, contingent on community incidence rate.

ResultsSchool transmission risk varies according to student age and community incidence and is substantially reduced with effective, consistent mitigation measures. Nevertheless, when transmission occurs, it may be difficult to detect without regular, frequent testing due to the subclinical nature of most infections in children. Teacher vaccination can reduce transmission to staff, while asymptomatic screening both improves understanding of local circumstances and reduces transmission, facilitating five-day schedules at full classroom capacity.

LimitationsThere is uncertainty about susceptibility and infectiousness of children and low precision regarding the effectiveness of specific prevention measures, particularly with emergence of new variants.

ConclusionWith controlled community transmission and moderate school-based prevention measures, elementary schools can open with few in-school transmissions, while high schools require more intensive mitigation. Asymptomatic screening should be a key component of school reopenings, allowing reopening at higher community incidence while still minimizing transmission risk.",Alyssa M Bilinski; Joshua A Salomon; John Giardina; Andrea Ciaranello; Meagan Fitzpatrick,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250388,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250388,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
334,Sequencing Data of North American SARS-CoV-2 Isolates Shows Widespread Complex Variants,"Several new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have been isolated in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Many of the variants contain single variants of functional significance (e.g. S: N501Y increases transmissibility). To study the occurrence and co-circulation of these variants, we have developed an easy-to-use dashboard at janieslab.github.io/sars-cov-2.

We created a multiple sequence alignment workflow and processing script to generate a variant dataset, which populates this dashboard. We then use the features of the dashboard, such as visualization of the single and complex nucleotide variants geospatially and in a color-coded matrix format. Users also interact with the dashboard to filter the underlying data to regions of interest and or variants of interest. The user can export reports based on the desired filters, which we intend to be used for regionally specific pandemic response. We find in Genbank, an isolate from Massachusetts containing [(S: Q677H), (ORF3a: Q57H), (M: A85S), (N: D377Y)] collected on September 11, 2020.

Moreover, we find that many viral isolates bear a marker of increased transmissibility (S: N501Y) in linkage with at least one variant of concern isolated from Ohio also range across the Untied States and stretch from British Columbia, Canada to Mexico. When we analyze co-circulation of more complex variant constellations with (S: N501Y), we note that the Upper Midwest and Northeast United States contain these isolates.

In summary, the viral variants that have raised concern in a few US States in recent reports are widespread. Based on the increase in the proportion of variant viruses being sampled and some empirical evidence in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Ohio, these variants are likely to lead to increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across North America in the coming months.",Colby T Ford; Rachel Scott; Denis Jacob Machado; Daniel Janies,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250648,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250648,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,True
335,The effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162 b 2 vaccine in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization: real-world evidence,"BackgroundBNT162b2 vaccines showed high efficacy against COVID-19 in a randomised controlled phase-III trial. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in real life settings is urgently needed, especially given the global disease surge. Hence, we assessed the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the BNT162b2 Phase-III results, we hypothesized that the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinees will decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence during the preceding days.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2{middle dot}6 million-member state-mandated health provider in Israel. Study population consisted of all members aged 16 or above years who were vaccinated with BNT162b2-vaccine between December/19/2020 and January/15/2021. We collected information regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test from days after first dose to January/17/2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13-24 were compared to days 1-12 after first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models.

FindingsData of 503,875 individuals (mean age 59{middle dot}7 years SD=14{middle dot}7, 47{middle dot}8% males) were analysed, of whom 351,897 had 13-24 days of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0{middle dot}57% (n=2484) during days 1-12 and 0{middle dot}27% (n=614) in days 13-24. A 51{middle dot}4% relative risk reduction (RRR) was calculated in weighted-average daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 43{middle dot}41-per-100,000(SE=12{middle dot}07) in days 1-12 to 21{middle dot}08-per-100,000(SE=6{middle dot}16) in days 13-24 following immunization. The decrement in incidence was evident from day 18 after first dose. Similar RRRs were calculated in individuals aged 60 or above (44.5%), younger individuals (50.2%), females (50.0%) and males (52.1%). Findings were similar in sub-populations and patients with various comorbidities.

ConclusionsWe demonstrated an effectiveness of 51% of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization with the first dose. Immunization with the second dose should be continued to attain the anticipated protection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for follow-up studies regarding the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine without any language restrictions. The search terms were (BNT162b2 OR mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine) AND (effectiveness OR real-world OR phase IV) until Jan 15, 2021. We found no relevant observational studies among humans. We also assessed Phase II and Phase III clinical trials with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first and largest phase IV study on the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in real-world settings. Our findings showed that the first dose of the vaccine is associated with an approximately 51% reduction in the incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections at 13 to 24 days after immunization compared to the rate during the first 12 days. Similar levels of effectiveness were found across age groups, sex, as well as among individuals residing in Arab or ultra-orthodox Jewish communities that display an increased COVID-19 risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe study results indicate that in real life the first dose of the new BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine confers around 50% protection against overall SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Together our findings and the 95% efficacy shown in the phase III trial, suggest that the BNT162b2 vaccine should be administered in two doses to achieve maximum protection and impact in terms of disease burden reduction and possibly reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

338,New-Onset IgG Autoantibodies in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including autoimmune features and autoantibody production. We developed three different protein arrays to measure hallmark IgG autoantibodies associated with Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs), Anti-Cytokine Antibodies (ACA), and anti-viral antibody responses in 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in three different centers. Autoantibodies were identified in approximately 50% of patients, but in <15% of healthy controls. When present, autoantibodies largely targeted autoantigens associated with rare disorders such as myositis, systemic sclerosis and CTD overlap syndromes. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were observed in [~]25% of patients. Patients with autoantibodies tended to demonstrate one or a few specificities whereas ACA were even more prevalent, and patients often had antibodies to multiple cytokines. Rare patients were identified with IgG antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). A subset of autoantibodies and ACA developed de novo following SARS-CoV-2 infection while others were transient. Autoantibodies tracked with longitudinal development of IgG antibodies that recognized SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins such as S1, S2, M, N and a subset of non-structural proteins, but not proteins from influenza, seasonal coronaviruses or other pathogenic viruses. COVID-19 patients with one or more autoantibodies tended to have higher levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 1 (NSP1) and Methyltransferase (ME). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 causes development of new-onset IgG autoantibodies in a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and are positively correlated with immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.",Sarah Esther Chang; Allan Feng; Wenzhao Meng; Sokratis Apostolidis; Elisabeth Mack; Maja Artandi; Linda Barman; Kate Bennett; Saborni Chakraborty; Iris Chang; Peggie Cheung; Sharon Chinthrajah; Shaurya Dhingra; Evan Do; Amanda Finck; Andrew Gaano; Reinhard Gessner; Heather M.

339,Association of COVID-19 incidence with objectively and subjectively measured mental health proxies in the Austrian Football League: an epidemiological study,"ObjectiveWe aimed to explore the association of COVID-19 incidence with mental health in 225 team and staff members of five professional Austrian Football clubs captured by objective (location variance) or subjective (self-reported sleep quality, level of recovery, perceived risk of infection) mental health proxies.

MethodsData collected during the implementation of a novel monitoring concept to enable safe continuation of professional Football during the COVID-19 pandemic were matched with Austrian COVID-19 incidence data and smartphone collected location data (time-period June 17th to July 31st, 2020). Multivariable linear regression models explored the association of COVID-19 incidence, defined as daily novel or active cases of COVID-19, with the objective and subjective health proxies while adjusting for the occurrence of one COVID-19 case in a staff member in one of the clubs, team status (i.e. player vs staff) and game days.

ResultsData from 115 participants were analysed. An increasing number of novel COVID-19 cases was significantly associated with deteriorating sleep quality (B 0.48, 95% CI 0.05; 1.00) but with none of the other mental health proxies. An increasing number of active COVID-19 cases was significantly associated with an increase in perceived infection risk (B 0.04, 95% CI 0.00; 0.07) and location variance (B 0.28, 95% CI 0.06; 0.49).

ConclusionThe adverse association of an increasing COVID-19 incidence with mental health in professional Footballers and staff members became obvious particularly in subjectively measured mental health. During the ongoing pandemic, targeted mental care should be included in the daily routines of this population.

340,The SARS-CoV-2 Y453F mink variant displays a striking increase in ACE-2 affinity but does not challenge antibody neutralization,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to animals has been reported for many domesticated species, including cats, dogs and minks. Identification of novel spike gene mutations appearing in minks has raised major concerns about potential immune evasion and challenges for the global vaccine strategy. The genetic variant, known as ""cluster-five"", arose among farmed minks in Denmark and resulted in a complete shutdown of the worlds largest mink production. However, the functional properties of this new variant are not established. Here we present functional data on the Y453F cluster-five receptor-binding domain (RBD) and show that it does not decrease established humoral immunity or affect the neutralizing response in a vaccine model based on wild-type RBD or spike. However, it binds the human ACE-2 receptor with a four-fold higher affinity suggesting an enhanced transmission capacity and a possible challenge for viral control.",Rafael Bayarri-Olmos; Anne Rosbjerg; Laust Bruun Johnsen; Charlotte Helgstrand; Theresa Bak-Thomsen; Peter Garred; Mikkel-Ole Skjoedt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.428834,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.428834,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,False

342,Development of spike receptor-binding domain nanoparticle as a vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, enters host cells via the interaction of its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of RBD protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling H. pylori-bullfrog ferritin nanoparticles as an antigen delivery. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. 16-20 months-old ferrets were vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD-nanoparticles) by intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD-nanoparticles produced potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious viruses in nasal washes and lungs as well as viral RNA in respiratory organs.

In the months that followed, many studies, both in vitro and in animal models, showed that variants carrying this mutation were more infectious and more readily transmitted than the ancestral Wuhan form. Here we investigate why a recently published study by van Dorp et al. failed to detect such higher transmissibility of the G614 variant using homoplasy-based methods. We show that both low diversity and recombination confound the methods utilized by van Dorp et al. and significantly decrease their sensitivity.

Here we scan SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences in-silico for innovations along the evolutionary lineage starting with the last common ancestor of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 substantially differs from viruses outside sarbecovirus both in its set of encoded proteins and in their domain architectures, indicating divergent functional demands. Within sarbecoviruses, sub-domain level profiling using predicted linear epitopes reveals how the primary interface between host cell and virus, the spike, was gradually reshaped. The only epitope that is private to SARS-CoV-2 overlaps with the furin cleavage site, a ""switch"" that modulates spikes conformational landscape in response to host-cell interaction. This cleavage site has fundamental relevance for both immune evasion and cell infection, and the apparently ongoing evolutionary fine-tuning of its use by SARS-CoV-2 should be monitored.",Ruben Iruegas López; Julian Dosch; Mateusz Sikora; Gerhard Hummer; Roberto Covino; Ingo Ebersberger,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.428808,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.428808,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,False
346,"The angiotensin type 2 receptor agonist C21 restores respiratory function in COVID19 - a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial","BackgroundAlthough several therapies have been evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 are still significant, and the need for safe and effective drugs remains high even after launch of vaccine programs.

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with the novel oral angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist C21 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with C-reactive protein 50-150 mg/L but not needing mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to oral C21 (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days in addition to standard of care, including glucocorticoids and remdesivir.

Results106 patients underwent randomization (51 in the C21 group and 55 in the placebo group). At day 14 after start of treatment, the proportion of patients still requiring supplemental oxygen was significantly reduced by 90% in the C21 group compared to the placebo group (p=0.003). Moreover, fewer patients required mechanical ventilation (one C21 patient and four placebo patients), and C21 was associated with a numerical reduction in the mortality rate (one and three deaths in the C21 and placebo group, respectively). Treatment with C21 was safe and well tolerated.

ConclusionsAs studied in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, C21 on top of standard of care led to a clinically beneficial improvement in respiratory function compared to placebo, paving the way for a pivotal randomised controlled trial.

348,Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal mucosa in children and adults,"RationaleDespite similar viral load and infectivity rates between children and adults infected with SARS-CoV-2, children rarely develop severe illness. Differences in the host response to the virus at the primary infection site are among the proposed mechanisms.

ObjectivesTo investigate the host response to SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza virus (IV) in the nasal mucosa in children and adults.

MethodsClinical outcomes and gene expression in the nasal mucosa were analyzed in 36 children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 24 children with RSV infection, 9 children with IV infection, 16 adults with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 7 healthy pediatric and 13 healthy adult controls.

ResultsIn both children and adults, infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to an interferon response in the nasal mucosa. The magnitude of the interferon response correlated with the abundance of viral reads and was comparable between symptomatic children and adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 and symptomatic children infected with RSV and IV. Cell type deconvolution identified an increased abundance of immune cells in the samples from children and adults with a viral infection. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 - key entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 - did not correlate with age or presence or absence of viral infection.

349,Trajectories of Hypoxemia & Respiratory System Mechanics of COVID-19 ARDS in the NorthCARDS dataset,"RationaleThe preliminary reports of COVID Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (COVIDARDS) suggest the existence of a subset of patients with higher lung compliance despite profound hypoxemia. Understanding heterogeneity seen in patients with COVIDARDS and comparing to non-COVIDARDS may inform tailored treatments.

ObjectivesTo describe the trajectories of hypoxemia and respiratory compliance in COVIDARDS and associations with outcomes.

MethodsA multidisciplinary team of frontline clinicians and data scientists created the Northwell COVIDARDS dataset (NorthCARDS) leveraging over 11,542 COVID-19 hospital admissions. Data was summarized to describe differences based on clinically meaningful categories of lung compliance, and compared to non-COVIDARDS reports. A sophisticated method of extrapolating PaO2 from SpO2, as well estimating FiO2 from non invasive oxygen delivery devices were utilized to create meaningful trends of derived PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F).

Measurements and Main ResultsOf the 1595 COVIDARDS patients in the NorthCARDS dataset, there were 538 (34{middle dot}6%) who had very low lung compliance (<20ml/cmH2O), 982 (63{middle dot}2%) with low-normal compliance (20-50ml/cmH2O), and 34 (2{middle dot}2%) with high lung compliance (>50ml/cmH2O). The very low compliance group had double the median time to intubation compared to the low-normal group (107 hours(IQR 26{middle dot}3, 238{middle dot}3) vs. 37{middle dot}9 hours(IQR 4{middle dot}8, 90{middle dot}7)). Oxygenation trends have improved in all groups after a nadir immediately post intubation. The P/F ratio improved from a mean of 109 to 155, with the very low compliance group showing a smaller improvement compared to low compliance group. The derived P/F trends closely correlated with blood gas analysis driven P/F trends, except immediately post intubation were the trends diverge as illustrated in the image. Overall, 67{middle dot}5% (n=1049) of the patients died during the hospitalization. In comparison to non-COVIDARDS reports, there were less patients in the high compliance category (2.2%vs.12%, compliance [&ge;]50mL/cmH20), and more patients with P/F [&le;] 150 (57{middle dot}8% vs. 45.6%). No correlation was apparent between lung compliance and P/F ratio. The Oxygenation Index was similar, (11{middle dot}12(SD 5{middle dot}67)vs.12{middle dot}8(SD 10{middle dot}8)).

ConclusionsHeterogeneity in lung compliance is seen in COVIDARDS, without apparent correlation to degree of hypoxemia. Notably, time to intubation was greater in the very low lung compliance category.

350,Distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predict recovery from severe COVID-19,"Although T cells are likely players in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, little is known about the phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with recovery from severe COVID-19. We analyzed T cells from longitudinal specimens of 34 COVID-19 patients with severities ranging from mild (outpatient) to critical culminating in death. Relative to patients that succumbed, individuals that recovered from severe COVID-19 harbored elevated and increasing numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells capable of homeostatic proliferation. In contrast, fatal COVID-19 displayed elevated numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific regulatory T cells and a time-dependent escalation in activated bystander CXCR4+ T cells. Together with the demonstration of increased proportions of inflammatory CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients, these results support a model whereby lung-homing T cells activated through bystander effects contribute to immunopathology, while a robust, non-suppressive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response limits pathogenesis and promotes recovery from severe COVID-19.

BRIEF SUMMARYBy conducting CyTOF on total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from longitudinal specimens spanning the entire spectrum of COVID-19 diseases, Neidleman et al. demonstrate that spike-specific Th1 cells capable of IL7-dependent homeostatic proliferation predict survival from severe COVID-19, while Tregs and IL6+ CD8+ T cells recognizing spike predict fatal outcome. Fatal COVID-19 is characterized by escalating activation of bystander CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs.

351,Genome-scale metabolic modeling reveals SARS-CoV-2-induced host metabolic reprogramming and identifies metabolic antiviral targets,"Tremendous progress has been made to control the COVID-19 pandemic, including the development and approval of vaccines as well as the drug remdesivir, which inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. However, remdesivir confers only mild benefits to a subset of patients, and additional effective therapeutic options are needed. Drug repurposing and drug combinations may represent practical strategies to address these urgent unmet medical needs. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack the host metabolism to facilitate their own proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12 published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2 infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM). We find that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce recurrent and complicated metabolic reprogramming spanning a wide range of metabolic pathways. We next applied the GEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm (MTA) to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets that counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. These predictions are enriched for validated targets from various published experimental drug and genetic screens. Further analyzing the RNA-sequencing data of remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples that we generated, we predicted metabolic targets that act in combination with remdesivir. These predictions are enriched for previously reported synergistic drugs with remdesivir. Since our predictions are based in part on human patient data, they are likely to be clinically relevant. We provide our top high-confidence candidate targets for their evaluation in further studies, demonstrating host metabolism-targeting as a promising antiviral strategy.",Kuoyuan Cheng; Laura Riva; Sanju Sinha; Lipika Ray Pal; Nishanth Ulhas Nair; Laura Martin-Sancho; Sumit K.

352,SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 is susceptible to neutralizing antibodies elicited by ancestral Spike vaccines,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein mediates virus entry and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. All current vaccines are based on the ancestral Spike with the goal of generating a protective neutralizing antibody response. Several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple Spike mutations have emerged, and their rapid spread and potential for immune escape have raised concerns. One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 is not a neutralization escape variant that would be a major concern for current vaccines, or for an increased risk of reinfection.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428516,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428516,2021-01-28,2021-01-28,,False
353,Unbiased interrogation of memory B cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients reveals a broad antiviral humoral response targeting SARS-CoV-2 antigens beyond the spike protein,"Patients who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infections produce antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against multiple viral proteins. Here, an unbiased interrogation of the anti-viral memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients has been performed by generating large, stable hybridoma libraries and screening thousands of monoclonal antibodies to identify specific, high-affinity immunoglobulins (Igs) directed at distinct viral components. As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of VL and VH gene usage. These findings demonstrated that an unbiased, function-based approach towards interrogating the COVID-19 patient memory B cell response may have distinct advantages relative to genomics-based approaches when identifying highly effective anti-viral antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.",Jillian M DiMuzio; Baron C Heimbach; Raymond J Howanski; John P Dowling; Nirja B Patel; Noeleya Henriquez; Chris Nicolescu; Mitchell Nath; Antonio Polley; Jamie L Bingaman; Todd Smith; Benjamin C Harman; Matthew K Robinson; Michael J Morin; Pavel A Nikitin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428534,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428534,2021-01-28,2021-01-28,,False
354,D614G Substitution of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Increases Syncytium Formation and Viral Transmission via Enhanced Furin-mediated Spike Cleavage,"Since the D614G substitution in the spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2 emerged, the variant strain underwent rapid expansion to become the most abundant strain worldwide. Therefore, this substitution may provide an advantage of viral spreading. To explore the mechanism, we analyzed 18 viral isolates containing S proteins with either G614 or D614. Both the virus titer and syncytial phenotype were significantly increased in S-G614 than in S-D614 isolates. We further showed increased cleavage of S at the furin substrate site, a key event that promotes syncytium, in S-G614 isolates. These functions of the D614G substitution were validated in cells expressing S protein. The effect on syncytium was abolished by furin inhibitor treatment and mutation of the furin-cleavage site, suggesting its dependence on cleavage by furin. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the increased transmissibility of S-G614 containing SARS-CoV-2 through enhanced furin-mediated S cleavage, which increases membrane fusion and virus infectivity.",Ya-Wen Cheng; Tai-Ling Chao; Chiao-Ling Li; Sheng-Han Wang; Han-Chieh Kao; Ya-Min Tsai; Hurng-Yi Wang; Chi-Ling Hsieh; Pei-Jer Chen; Sui-Yuan Chang; Shiou-Hwei Yeh,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428541,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428541,2021-01-28,2021-01-28,,False
355,Early therapy with remdesivir and antibody combinations improves COVID-19 disease in mice,"Improving the standard of clinical care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health priority. Small molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of single agent therapies has not been comprehensively defined over the time course of infection and it is not known if combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies. In kinetic studies in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis model, we show that single-agent therapies exert potent antiviral effects even when initiated relatively late after infection, but their efficacy is diminished as a function of time. RDV and a cocktail of two mAbs in combination provided improved outcomes compared to single agents alone extending the therapeutic window of intervention with less weight loss, decreased virus lung titers, reduced acute lung injury, and improved pulmonary function. Overall, we demonstrate that direct-acting antivirals combined with potent mAb can improve outcomes over single agents alone in animal models of COVID-19 thus providing a rationale for the coupling of therapies with disparate modalities to extend the therapeutic window of treatment.",David Martinez; Alexandra Schaefer; Sarah R.

356,Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes using convolutional neural networks: application to SARS-CoV-2,"Biochemical phenotypes are major indexes for protein structure and function characterization. They are determined, at least in part, by the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids and may be reflected in the protein three-dimensional structure. Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes is a critical step for understanding protein function and disease mechanism as well as enabling drug discovery. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments have been performed on SARS-CoV-2's spike receptor binding domain and the human ACE2 zinc-binding peptidase domain - both central players in viral infection and evolution and antibody evasion - quantifying how mutations impact binding affinity and protein expression. Here, we modeled biochemical phenotypes from massively parallel assays, using convolutional neural networks trained on protein sequence mutations in the virus and human host. We found that neural networks are significantly predictive of binding affinity, protein expression, and antibody escape, learning complex interactions and higher-order features that are difficult to capture with conventional methods from structural biology. Integrating the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids, including hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, and long-range non-bonded energy per atom, significantly improved prediction (empirical p<0.01) though there was such a strong dependence on the sequence data alone to yield reasonably good prediction. We observed concordance of the DMS data and our neural network predictions with an independent study on intermolecular interactions from molecular dynamics (multiple 500 ns or 1 s all-atom) simulations of the spike protein-ACE2 interface, with critical implications for the use of deep learning to dissect molecular mechanisms. The mutation- or genetically- determined component of a biochemical phenotype estimated from the neural networks has improved causal inference properties relative to the original phenotype and can facilitate crucial insights into disease pathophysiology and therapeutic design.",Bo Wang; Eric R Gamazon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.428521,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.428521,2021-01-28,2021-01-28,,False
357,Coronavirus associated molecular mimicry common to SARS-CoV-2 peptide,"Relationship of COVID-19 and immunity is complex and can involve autoimmune reactions through molecular mimicry. We investigated autoimmunity related pathological mechanisms involving molecular mimicry that are common to certain coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by means of a selected peptide sequence (CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC). Accordingly, coronavirus-associated sequences that are homologous to that 15mer sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome are attained first. Then, homologous human and coronavirus sequences are obtained, wherein the coronavirus sequences are homologous to the 15mer SARS-CoV-2 peptide. All the identified query-subject sequences contained at least 7 residue matches in the aligned regions. Finally, parts of those coronavirus and host sequences, which are predicted to have high affinity to the same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as that of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, are selected among the query and subject epitope-pairs that were both (predicted to be) strongly binding to the same HLA alleles. The proteins or the protein regions with those predicted epitopes include, but not limited to, immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions, phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2, slit homolog 2 protein, and CRB1 isoform I precursor. These proteins are potentially associated with certain pathologies, but especially the possible CRB1 related coronavirus pathogenicity could be furthered by autoimmunity risk in HLA*A24:02 serotypes. Overall, results imply autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients with HLA*A02:01 and HLA*A24:02 serotypes in general, through molecular mimicry. This is also common to other coronaviruses than SARS-CoV-2. These results are indicative at the current stage, they need to be validated.

358,Genetic and structural basis for recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by a two-antibody cocktail,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an urgent need to understand the molecular basis for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein antigenic sites. To define the genetic and structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we determined the structures of two human monoclonal antibodies COV2-2196 and COV2-21301, which form the basis of the investigational antibody cocktail AZD7442, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. COV2-2196 forms an ""aromatic cage"" at the heavy/light chain interface using germline-encoded residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals1-4. The structure of COV2-2130 reveals that an unusually long LCDR1 and HCDR3 make interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of COV2-2196. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the critical residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern for possible viral escape. Nonetheless, both COV2-2196 and COV2130 showed strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 strain with recent variations of concern including E484K, N501Y, and D614G substitutions.

359,Spike mutations decrease SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies but not ACE2-Ig in vitro,"Spontaneous and selection-pressure-driven evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has started to pose more challenges to controlling the pandemic. Here, we first investigated cross-species receptor usage of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerged during the pandemic. We found that, in contrast to an early isolate WHU01, the circulating variants B.1.1.7/501Y.V1, B.1.351/501Y.V2, and P.1/501Y.V3 were able to use rat and mouse Ace2 orthologs as entry receptors, suggesting that rats and mice might be able to harbor and spread these variants. We then evaluated in vitro sensitivity of these variants to three therapeutic antibodies in clinics (etesevimab/LY-CoV016, casirivimab/REGN10933, and imdevimab/REGN10987) and an ACE2-Ig variant we developed recently. We found that all the tested SARS-CoV-2 variants showed reduced sensitivity to at least one of the tested antibodies but slightly increased sensitivity to the ACE2-Ig protein.

360,"A flexible, pan-species, multi-antigen platform for the detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the vaccination effort that is ongoing has created an unmet need for accessible, affordable, flexible and precise platforms for monitoring the induction, specificity and maintenance of virus-specific immune responses. Herein we validate a multiplex (Luminex-based) assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies irrespective of host species, antibody isotype, and specimen type (e.g. plasma, serum, saliva or blood spots). The well-established precision of Luminex-based assays provides the ability to follow changes in antibody levels over time to many antigens, including multiple permutations of the most common SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This platform can easily measure antibodies known to correlate with neutralization activity as well as multiple non-SARS-CoV-2 antigens such as vaccines (e.g. Tetanus toxoid) or those from frequently encountered agents (influenza), which serve as stable reference points for quantifying the changing SARS-specific responses. All of the antigens utilized in our study can be made in-house, many in E. coli using readily available plasmids. Commercially sourced antigens may also be incorporated and newly available antigen variants can be rapidly produced and integrated, making the platform adaptable to the evolving viral strains in this pandemic.

361,The Association Between Hypoglycemic Agents and Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 in Patients with Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundDuring the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, diabetic patients face disproportionately more. Anti-inflammatory effects of hypoglycemic agents have been reported, and their beneficial or harmful effects in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 remain controversial.

PurposeThis study was performed to clarify this association.

Data SourcesRelevant literature was searched on China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, Chinese periodical service platform VIP Database, Sinomed (China Biology Medicine, CBM), MedRxiv, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Ovid Databases (LWW), Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, Oxford Academic, Nature Press Group, Cochrane Library and BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine up to November 14, 2020.

Study SelectionOnly observational studies of hypoglycemic agents vs. drugs or therapy without hypoglycemic agents in adult diabetic patients with COVID-19 were included.

Data ExtractionData of death and poor composite outcomes were extracted.

Data SynthesisThe pooled effects were calculated using the fixed-effects or random-effects models based on heterogeneity assessment.

LimitationMost studies were retrospective cohort studies with relative weak capability to verify causality.

ConclusionHome use of metformin might be beneficial in decreasing mortality in diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that metformin and other hypoglycemic agents are associated with poor composite outcomes. More prospective studies, especially RCTs are needed.

362,COVID-19-related disruptions to routine vaccination services in India: perspectives from pediatricians,"Background and ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions to routine immunization programs in India and around the world, setting the stage for potentially serious outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

MethodsWe surveyed pediatric healthcare providers in India in 2 rounds in April-June and September 2020 to understand how COVID-19 control measures may have impacted routine vaccination.

ResultsRespondents were predominantly pediatricians working in primary, secondary or tertiary healthcare centers, across 21 Indian states and two union territories. Among the 424 (survey 1) and 141 (survey 2) respondents, 33.4% and 7.8%, respectively, reported near complete suspension of vaccination services due to COVID-19. A 50% or greater drop in vaccination services was reported by 83.1% of respondents in June, followed by 32.6% four months later, indicating slow recovery of services. By September 2020, 83.6% were aware of updated guidelines on safe provision of immunization services, although awareness of specific catch-up vaccination plans was low, and 76.6% expressed concern about a vaccine coverage gap that could potentially lead to increased non-COVID-19 illnesses and deaths.

ConclusionsPandemic-related disruptions to vaccination services were reported by pediatricians across India. Concerted efforts are needed from governing and academic groups to ensure that routine immunization and catch-up programs are implemented during this pandemic, which can sustain gains in vaccination coverage and provide a robust blueprint for the national roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine.",Anita Shet; Baldeep Dhaliwal; Preetika Banerjee; Kelly Carr; Andrea DeLuca; Carl Britto; Rajeev Seth; Bakul Parekh; GV Basavaraj; Digant Shastri; Piyush Gupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250040,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250040,2021-01-27,2021-01-27,,True

Materials and MethodsA web-based survey was sent to 468 Brazilian urology residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 to collect data on clinical practice and training after 4 months of COVID-19. We also assessed health-related and behavior changes, rate of infection by SARS-CoV-2, deployment to the front line of COVID-19, residents concerns, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE).

ResultsMassive reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations, diagnostic procedures and surgeries were reported across the country, affecting PGY 3 to 5 alike. Most in-person educational activities were abolished. The median damage to the urological training expected for 2020 was 6.0 [3.4 -7.7], on a scale from 0 to 10, with senior residents estimating a greater damage (P< 0.001). Educational interventions developed included online case-based discussions, subspeciality conferences and lectures, and grand rounds. Most senior residents favored extending residency to compensate for training loss and most younger residents favored no additional training (p< 0.001). Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (43.8%), reduced physical activity (68.6%), increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and cigarette consumption (53.6%), worsening of sexual life (25.2%) and feelings of sadness or depression (48,2%). Almost half were summoned to work on the COVID-19 front-line and 24.4% had COVID-19. Most residents had inadequate training to deal with COVID-19 patients and most reported a shortage of PPE. Residents concerns included the risk of contaminating family members, being away from residency program, developing severe COVID-19 and overloading colleagues.

ObjectiveTo determine public views regarding government and private conferral of immunity privileges.

Design and SettingU.S. national on-line survey fielded in June 2020. Participants were randomly asked about either government ""passports"" or private ""certificates"" for COVID-19 immunity.

ParticipantsU.S. adults from a standing panel maintained for academic research, selected to approximate national demographics.

Main Outcomes/MeasuresLevel of support/opposition to immunity privileges, and whether views vary based on: government vs. private adoption; demographics; political affiliation or views; or various COVID19-related attitudes and experiences.

ResultsOf 1315 respondents, 45.2% supported immunity privileges, with slightly more favoring private certificates than government passports (48.1% vs 42.6%, p=0.04). Support was greater for using passports or certificates to enable returns to high-risk jobs or attendance at large recreational events than for returning to work generally. Levels of support did not vary significantly according to age groups, socioeconomic or employment status, urbanicity, political affiliation or views, or whether the respondent had chronic disease(s). However, estimates from adjusted analyses showed less support among women (Odds Ratio, 0.64; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.51 to 0.80), and among Hispanics (0.56; 0.40 to 0.78) and other minorities (0.58; 0.40 to 0.85) compared with whites, but not among blacks (0.83; 0.60 to 1.15). Opposition was much lower among those who personally wanted a passport or certificate (24.4%) and much higher among those who believed this would harm the social fabric of their community (77.1%).

Conclusions and RelevancePublic views are divided on either government or private use of immunity certificates, but these views do not vary along usual political lines or by characteristics that indicate individual vulnerability to infection. Social consensus on the desirability of an immunity privileges programs may be difficult to achieve.

MethodsParticipants of the KCL CHECK study were sent a SureScreen Diagnostics COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette to complete at home in June 2020 (phase 1) and September 2020 (phase 2). Participants were asked to upload a test result image to a study website. Test result images and sociodemographic information were analysed by the research team.

ResultsA total of n=2716 participants enrolled in the KCL CHECK study, with n=2003 (73.7%) and n=1825 (69.3%) consenting and responding to phase 1 and 2. Of these, n=1882 (93.9%; phase 1) and n=1675 (91.8%; phase 2) returned a valid result. n=123 (6.5%; phase 1) and n=91 (5.4%; phase 2) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A total of n=1488 participants provided a result in both phases, with n=57 (3.8%) testing positive for SARS- CoV-2 antibodies across both phases, suggesting a reduction in the number of positive antibody results over time. Initial comparisons showed variation by age group, gender and clinical role.

ConclusionsOur study highlights the feasibility of rapid, repeated and low-cost SARS-CoV-2 serological testing without the need for face-to-face contact.

What is already known about this subject?Higher education institutions have a duty of care to minimise the spread and transmission of COVID-19 in its campuses, and among staff and students. The reopening of higher education buildings and campuses has brought about a mass movement of students, academics and support staff from across the UK. Serological antibody studies can assist by highlighting groups of people and behaviours associated with high risk of COVID-19.

What are the new findings?We report a framework for SARS-CoV-2 serological antibody testing in an occupational group of postgraduate research students and current members of staff at Kings College London. Over two phases of data collection, 6.5% (phase 1) and 5.4% (phase 2) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with only 3.8% testing positive for antibodies in both phases, suggesting a reduction in positive antibody results over time.

366,Lack of trust and social media echo chambers predict COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy,"As COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out across the world, there are growing concerns about the role that trust, belief in conspiracy theories and spread of misinformation through social media impact vaccine hesitancy. We use a nationally representative survey of 1,476 adults in the UK between December 12 to 18, 2020 and five focus groups conducted in the same period. Trust is a core predictor, with distrust in vaccines in general and mistrust in government raising vaccine hesitancy. Trust in health institutions and experts and perceived personal threat are vital, with focus groups revealing that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is driven by a misunderstanding of herd immunity as providing protection, fear of rapid vaccine development and side effects, belief the virus is man- made and related to population control. Particularly those who obtain information from relatively unregulated social media sources such as YouTube that have recommendations tailored by watch history are less likely to be willing to become vaccinated. Those who hold general conspiratorial beliefs are less willing to be vaccinated.

MethodsFive databases and websites for preprints were searched until January 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective cohorts assessing ivermectin versus control in ambulatory and hospitalized participants. The primary outcome was overall mortality. Secondary outcome was recovered patients. For meta-analysis, random-effects and inverse variance meta-analyses with logarithmic transformation were performed. ROBINS-I for cohort studies, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for trials were used. The strength of evidence was assessed using GRADE.

In total, 7412 participants were reported, the mean age was 47.5 (SD 9.5) years, and 4283 (58%) were male. Ivermectin was not associated with reduced mortality (logRR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.70, p = 0.04, I2= 84.7%), or reduced patient recovery (logRR 5.52, 95% CI -24.36 to 35.4, p = 0.51, I2 = 92.6%). All studies had a high risk of bias, and showed a very low certainty of the evidence.

368,Association between COVID-19 mortality and population level health and socioeconomic indicators,"With the availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines and the predicted shortages in supply for the near future, it is necessary to allocate vaccines in a manner that minimizes severe outcomes. To date, vaccination strategies in the US have focused on individual characteristics such as age and occupation. In this study, we assess the utility of population-level health and socioeconomic indicators as additional criteria for geographical allocation of vaccines. Using spatial autoregressive models, we demonstrate that 43% of the variability in COVID-19 mortality in US counties can be explained by health/socioeconomic factors, adjusting for case rates. Of the indicators considered, prevalence of chronic kidney disease and proportion of population living in nursing homes were found to have the strongest association. In the context of vaccine rollout globally, our findings indicate that national and subnational estimates of burden of disease could be useful for minimizing COVID-19 mortality.",Sasikiran Kandula; Jeffrey Shaman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250468,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250468,2021-01-27,2021-01-27,,True
369,Fallow time determination in dentistry using aerosol measurement.,"AimTo calculate fallow time (FT) required following dental aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in both a dental hospital (mechanically ventilated) and primary care (non-mechanically ventilated). Secondary outcomes were to identify spread and persistence of aerosol in open clinics compared to closed surgeries (mechanically ventilated environment), and identify if extra-oral scavenging (EOS) reduces production of aerosol and FT.

MethodsIn vitro simulation of fast handpiece (FHP) cavity preparations using a manikin was conducted in a mechanically and non-mechanically ventilated environment using Optical Particle Sizer and NanoScan at baseline, during the procedure and fallow period.

ResultsAGPs carried out in the non-mechanically, non-ventilated environment failed to achieve baseline particle levels after one hour. In contrast, when windows were opened after AGP, there was an immediate reduction in all particle sizes.

In mechanically ventilated environments the baseline levels of particles were very low and particle count returned to baseline within 10 minutes following AGP. There was no detectable difference between particles in mechanically ventilated open bays and closed surgeries.

The effect of the EOS was greater in non-mechanically ventilated environment on reducing the particle count; additionally, it also reduced the spikes in particle counts in mechanically ventilated environments.

ConclusionHigh-efficiency particulate air filtered mechanical ventilation along with mitigating factors (high-volume suction) resulted in reduction of FT (10 minutes). Non-ventilated rooms failed to reach baseline level even after one hour of FT. There was no difference in particle counts in open bay or closed surgeries in mechanically ventilated settings. The use of an EOS device can reduce the particulate spikes during procedures in both mechanical and non-mechanical environments.

This study confirms that AGPs are not recommended in dental surgeries where no ventilation is possible. No difference was demonstrated in FT required in open bays and closed surgeries in mechanically ventilated settings.

Clinical significanceAGPs should not be carried out in surgeries where ventilation is not possible. Mechanical ventilation for AGPs should be gold standard; where not available or practical then the use of natural ventilation with EOS helps reduce FT. AGPs can be carried out in open bay environment with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour of mechanical ventilation. Four-handed dentistry with high-volume suction and saliva ejector are essential mitigating factors during AGPs.",Shakeel Shahdad Professor; Annika Hindocha Dr; Tulsi Patel Dr; Neil Cagney Dr; Jens-Dominik Mueller Dr; Amine Koched Dr; Noha Seoudi Dr; Claire Morgan Dr; Padhraig Fleming Dr; Ahmed Din Dr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250482,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250482,2021-01-27,2021-01-27,,True
370,"Water, sanitation, and hygiene practices and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in rural Odisha, India","Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices emerged as a critical component to controlling and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 131 semi-structured phone interviews with households in rural Odisha, India to understand behavior changes made in WASH practices as a result of the pandemic and challenges that would prevent best practices. Interviews were conducted from May-July 2020 with 73 heads of household, 37 caregivers of children less than five years old, and 21 members of village water and sanitation committees in villages with community-level piped water and high levels of latrine ownership. The majority of respondents (86%, N=104) reported a change in their handwashing practice due to COVID-19 or the related government lockdown, typically describing an increase in handwashing frequency, more thorough washing method, and/or use of soap. These improved handwashing practices remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and were often described as a new consistent practice after additional daily actions (such as returning home), suggesting new habit formation. Few participants (13%) reported barriers to handwashing. Some respondents also detailed improvements in other WASH behaviors including village-level cleaning of water tanks and/or treatment of piped water (48% of villages), household water treatment and storage (17% of respondents), and household cleaning (41% of respondents). However, there was minimal change in latrine use and child feces management practices as a result of the pandemic. We provide detailed thematic summaries of qualitative responses to allow for richer insights into these WASH behavior changes, or lack thereof, during the pandemic. The results also highlight the importance of ensuring communities have adequate WASH infrastructure to enable the practice of safe behaviors and strengthen resilience during a large-scale health crisis.",Valerie Bauza; Gloria D.

371,Efficacy of Colchicine in Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundEvidence suggests the role of an inflammatory storm in COVID-19 complications. Colchicine is an orally administered, anti-inflammatory medication beneficial in gout, pericarditis and coronary disease.

MethodsWe performed a randomized, double-blind trial involving non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or clinical criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to receive colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily for 3 days and once daily thereafter) or placebo for 30 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospitalization for COVID-19.

ResultsA total of 4488 patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint occurred in 4.7% of the patients in the colchicine group and 5.8% of those in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.79; 95.1% confidence interval (CI), 0.61 to 1.03; P=0.08). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 4.6% and 6.0% of patients in the colchicine and placebo groups, respectively (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.99; P=0.04). In these patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the odds ratios were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.99) for hospitalization due to COVID-19, 0.50 (95% CI, 0.23 to 1.07) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.19 to 1.66) for death. Serious adverse events were reported in 4.9% and 6.3% in the colchicine and placebo groups (P=0.05); pneumonia occurred in 2.9% and 4.1% of patients (P=0.02). Diarrhea was reported in 13.7% and 7.3% in the colchicine and placebo groups (P<0.0001).

ConclusionAmong non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, colchicine reduces the composite rate of death or hospitalization.

372,Low-Dose Ad26.COV2.S Protection Against SARS-CoV-2 Challenge in Rhesus Macaques,"We previously reported that a single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccine expressing an optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad26.COV2.S) protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of reduced doses of Ad26.COV2.S. 30 rhesus macaques were immunized once with 1x1011, 5x1010, 1.125x1010, or 2x109 vp Ad26.COV2.S or sham and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes. Vaccine doses as low as 2x109 vp provided robust protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of 1.125x1010 vp were required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells as well as binding and neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show evidence of virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical enhancement of disease compared with sham controls. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with a relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Moreover, our findings show that a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the upper respiratory tract compared with the lower respiratory tract.",Xuan He; Abishek Chandrashekar; Roland C.

GC-376 is a Mpro inhibitor with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Using the K18-hACE2 mouse model, the in vivo antiviral efficacy of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated. GC-376 treatment was not toxic in K18-hACE2 mice and produced milder tissue lesions, reduced viral loads, fewer presence of viral antigen, and reduced inflammation in comparison to vehicle-treated controls, most notably in the brain in mice challenged with a low virus dose. Although GC-376 was not sufficient to improve neither clinical symptoms nor survival, it did show a positive effect against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. This study supports the notion that the K18-hACE2 mouse model is suitable to study antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2, and GC-376 represents a promising lead candidate for further development to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",C.

374,Sequence signatures of two IGHV3-53/3-66 public clonotypes to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic onset, the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively characterized. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein are frequently encoded by IGHV3-53/3-66 with a short CDR H3. Germline-encoded sequence motifs in CDRs H1 and H2 play a major role, but whether any common motifs are present in CDR H3, which is often critical for binding specificity, have not been elucidated. Here, we identify two public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a 9-residue CDR H3 that pair with different light chains. Distinct sequence motifs on CDR H3 are present in the two public clonotypes that appear to be related to differential light chain pairing. Additionally, we show that Y58F is a common somatic hypermutation that results in increased binding affinity of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a short CDR H3.

The outbreak and rapid transmission of COVID-19 have endangered the global health and economy. This study aimed to investigate the full-length genome mutation analysis of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates as 12 January 2021.

MethodsAll data of isolates was extracted from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database. CoVsurver was employed to investigate the full-length genome mutation analysis of all isolates. Furthermore, this study also focused on the unlocking of mutation in Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates S protein. WIV04 isolate that was originated from Wuhan, China was used as a virus reference according to CoVsurver default. All data was visualized using GraphPad Prism software, PyMOL, and BioRender.

ResultsThis study result showed that a full-length genome mutation analysis of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates was successfully discovered. Every single mutation in S protein was described and then visualised by employing BioRender. Furthermore, it also found that D614G mutation appeared in 103 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

377,Zinc supplement augments the suppressive effects of repurposed drugs of NF-kappa B inhibitor on ACE2 expression in human lung cell lines in vitro.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a vast number of infections and fatalities worldwide. As the development and safety validation of effective vaccines are ongoing, drug repurposing is most efficient approach to search FDA approved agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the present study, we found that endogenous ACE2 expressions could be detected in H322M and Calu-3 cell lines, as well as their ACE2 mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a NF-kappa B inhibitor, in dose- and time-dependent manners. Moreover, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) pretreatment reversed PDTC-induced ACE2 suppression, as well as the combined treatment of hydrogen peroxide and knockdown of p50 subunit of NF-kappa B by siRNA reduced ACE2 expression in H322M cells. In addition, anthelmintic drug triclabendazole and antiprotozoal drug emetine, repurposed drugs of NF-kappa B inhibitor, also inhibited ACE2 mRNA and protein expressions in H322M cells. Moreover, zinc supplement augmented the suppressive effects of triclabendazole and emetine on ACE2 suppression in H322M and Calu-3 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that ACE2 expression is modulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NF-kappa B signal in human lung cell lines, and zinc combination with triclabendazole or emetine has the clinical potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",Ming Cheng Lee; Yin-Kai Chen; Yih-Jen Hsu; Bor-Ru Lin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428372,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428372,2021-01-27,2021-01-27,,False

The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October, 2020, 43.9% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P1, P2 and B.1.1.33) in four Brazilian regions.

380,Computational Analysis of Protein Stability and Allosteric Interaction Networks in Distinct Conformational Forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614G Mutant: Reconciling Functional Mechanisms through Allosteric Model of Spike Regulation,"Structural and biochemical studies SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants with the enhanced infectivity have attracted significant attention and offered several mechanisms to explain the experimental data. The development of a unified view and a working model which is consistent with the diverse experimental data is an important focal point of the current work. In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms underlying functional effects of the D614G mutation by exploring atomistic modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as allosteric regulatory machines. We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis along with network-based community analysis to simulate structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. The results demonstrated that the D614 position anchors a key regulatory cluster that dictates functional transitions between open and closed states. Using molecular simulations and mutational sensitivity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we showed that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. The results offer support to the reduced shedding mechanism of S1 domain as a driver of the increased infectivity triggered by the D614G mutation. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By employing network community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions. This study provides atomistic-based view of the allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and communications in the residue interaction networks.",Gennady Verkhivker; Steve Agajanian; Deniz Oztas; Grace Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.428331,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.428331,2021-01-27,2021-01-27,,False

We report four X-ray crystal structures of three synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) (Sb16, Sb45 and Sb68) bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2: binary complexes of Sb16-RBD and Sb45-RBD; a ternary complex of Sb45-RBD-Sb68; and Sb16 unliganded. Sb16 and Sb45 bind the RBD at the ACE2 interface, positioning their CDR2 and CDR3 loops diametrically. Sb16 reveals a large CDR2 shift when binding the RBD. Sb68 interacts peripherally at the ACE2 interface; steric clashes with glycans explain its mechanism of viral neutralization. Superposing these structures onto trimeric spike (S) protein models indicates these sybodies bind conformations of the mature S protein differently, which may aid therapeutic design.

Therefore, it behaves creating several space-time manifestations of its dynamics. However, these physical manifestations in nature have not yet been fully disclosed or understood. Here we show 4-3 and 2-D space-time patterns of rate of infected individuals on a global scale, giving quantitative measures of transitions between different dynamical behaviour. By slicing the spatio-temporal patterns, we found manifestations of the virus behaviour such as cluster formation and bifurcations. Furthermore, by analysing the morphogenesis processes by entropy, we have been able to detect the virus phase transitions, typical of adaptive biological systems3. Our results for the first time describe the virus patterning behaviour processes all over the world, giving for them quantitative measures. We know that the outcomes of this work are still partial and more advanced analyses of the virus behaviour in nature are necessary.

A lesson from the Covid-19 lockdown.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruption to education in the UK in 2020, with most of the school teaching moving online and national school examinations being cancelled. This was particularly disruptive for those taking end of school examinations in preparation for higher education. Biological science courses require students to absorb a lot of new vocabulary and concepts, with examinations traditionally focusing on content recall rather than reasoning. Students who had entered university in September 2019 were compared with those arriving in September 2020 with respect to their knowledge of bioscience vocabulary and understanding of key concepts. Results showed no significant difference between those who had gone through the examination process in 2019 relative to those who had not, in 2020.

As we move into the era of vaccines, the detection of neutralising antibody will become increasingly important. Many serological tests have been developed under emergency use authorization, but their reliability remains unclear.

MethodsWe evaluated the performance of six commercially-available Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs), including a surrogate virus neutralization test, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), total or neutralising antibodies and a subset of results were compared to microneutralisation.

ResultsFor sera collected > 14 days post-symptom onset the Wantai total Ab performed best with highest sensitivity 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.6-100) followed by 93.1% for Euroimmun NCP-IgG,93.1% for GenScript Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test, 90.3% for Euroimmun S1-IgG, 88.9% for Euroimmun S1-IgA and 83.3% for Wantai IgM. Specificity for the best performing assay was 99.5% and for the lowest 97.1%.

ConclusionWantai ELISA, detecting total immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, had the best performance. Antibody target, timing and longevity of the immune response, and the objectives of testing should be considered in test choice. ELISAs should be used within a confirmatory testing algorithm to ensure reliable results. ELISAs provide high quality results, with flexibility for test numbers without the need for manufacturer specific analyzers.",Suellen R Nicholson; Theo Karapanagiotidis; Arseniy Khvorov; Celia Douros; Francesca Mordant; Katherine Bond; Deborah A Williamson; Damian Francis John Purcell; Sharon Lewin; Sheena Sullivan; Kanta Subbarao; Mike Catton,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250249,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250249,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
385,SARS-CoV-2 recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunity,"The coronaviral spike is the dominant viral antigen and the target of neutralizing antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of haem metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that the virus co-opts the haem metabolite for the evasion of humoral immunity via allosteric shielding of a sensitive epitope and demonstrate the remarkable structural plasticity of the NTD.",Annachiara Rosa; Valerie E Pye; Carl Graham; Luke Muir; Jeffrey Seow; Kevin W Ng; Nicola J Cook; Chloe Rees-Spear; Eleanor Parker; Mariana Silva dos Santos; Carolina Rosadas; Alberto Susana; Hefin Rhys; Andrea Nans; Laura Masino; Chloe Roustan; Evangelos Christodoulou; Rachel Ulferts; Antoni Wrobel; Charlotte-Eve Short; Michael Fertleman; Rogier W Sanders; Judith Heaney; Moira Spyer; Svend Kjaer; Andy Riddell; Michael H Malim; Rupert Beale; James I MacRae; Graham P Taylor; Eleni Nastouli; Marit J van Gils; Peter B Rosenthal; Massimo Pizzato; Myra O McClure; Richard S Tedder; George Kassiotis; Laura E McCoy; Katie J Doores; Peter Cherepanov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249203,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249203,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
386,Genomic insights into early SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in Reunion Island,"The relative isolation of many island communities provides some protection from the COVID-19 pandemic, as imported cases can be limited and traced effectively. Until recently, this was true for the population of the French overseas department, Reunion Island, where only limited numbers of autochthonous cases were observed prior to August 2020. Since the report of the first case of COVID-19, contact tracing has been carried out for each new case identified in Reunion Island to identify transmission and clusters. To contribute to the public health response and understand the diffusion of SARS-Cov-2 strains in Reunion Island, we established in-house genome sequencing capability in Reunion using Oxford nanopore technology (MinION) as an inexpensive option for genomic typing of SARS-CoV-2 lineages on the island, and cross-validated typing results between viral isolation methods and different sequencing technologies. The results of our work during the early phase of the epidemics are presented herein.

387,The usefulness of a quantitative olfactory test for the detection of COVID-19.,"BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, olfactory dysfunction (anosmia or hyposmia) has been reported by many patients and recognized as a prevalent and early symptom of infection. This finding has been associated with viral-induced olfactory neuron dysfunction rather than the nasal congestion typically found in cold- or flu-like states. In literature, the prevalence of anosmia varies from 15% to 85%, and the studies, in general, were based on the subjective evaluation of patients self-reports of loss of smell (yes or no question). In the present study, we quantitatively evaluated olfactory dysfunction and the prevalence of fever in symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 using a scratch-and-sniff olfactory test and infrared temperature testing with RT-PCR as the gold-standard comparator method to diagnose COVID-19 infection.

MethodsOutpatients had their forehead temperature checked with an infrared non-contact thermometer (temperature guns). After that, they received two olfactory smell identification test (SIT) cards (u-Smell-it; CT, USA) that each had 5 scent windows and were asked to scratch with a pencil and sniff each of the 10 small circles containing the microencapsulated fragrances and mark the best option on a response card. Nasopharyngeal swabs were then collected for Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to determine if the patients were positive or negative for COVID-19 infection. We considered the number of  hits (correct answers) [&le;] 5 as positive for loss of smell (LOS) in the olfactory test; [&ge;] 6 hits was considered negative for LOS (i.e. normal olfactory function). All data were analyzed using Excel and Matlab software.

ResultsIn the present study, 165 patients were eligible for the olfactory test and nasopharyngeal swab collection RT-PCR. Five patients were excluded because of inconclusive PCR results (n=2) and missing data (n=3). A total of 160 patients completed all the protocols. The RT-PCR positivity rate for COVID-19 was 27.5% (n=44), and PCR+ patients scored significantly worse in the olfactory test (5.5{+/-}3.5) compared to RT-PCR-patients (8.2{+/-}1.8, p<0.001). 0/44 PCR+ patients presented with a fever ([&ge;]37.8{degrees}C). In contrast an olfactory SIT had a specificity of 94.8% (95% CI, 89.1 - 98.1), sensitivity of 47.7% (95% CI, 32.7 - 63.3), accuracy of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75 - 0.87), positive predictive value of 77.8% (95% CI, 59.6 - 88.8), negative predictive value of 82.7% (85% CI, 78.7 - 86.7), and odds ratio of 16.7.

388,Comparison study of commercial COVID-19 RT-PCR kits propose an approach to evaluate their performances,"With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, scalable and high-throughput diagnostic testing is essential nationwide. Currently, RT-PCR has been the preferred method of viral detection and many manufacturers offer commercial kits for routine clinical diagnostics. In response to the incoming of various kits, there is a need to assess their performance and compatibility of use in clinical laboratories. Kit characteristics impact the testing workflow of these laboratories and some factors can render a kit to perform sub-optimally, leading to false results that are misleading for public safety. Here, we evaluated six commercial kits that are predominantly distributed to appointed testing facilities across Indonesia. Their performance was assessed based on their ease of use, availability, robustness and accuracy for scalable testing in a manual set-up. Our findings demonstrated that all six kits are suitable for use in routine diagnostics, but their considerations for use may vary according to different use-cases. To better guide considerations in procurement of kits, our study provided a systematic approach for laboratories to assess the performance of new incoming kits.",Hana Krismawati; Caroline Mahendra; Annabelle Hartanto; Muhammad Fajri Rokhmad; Semuel Sandi; Astrid Irwanto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250143,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
389,Model-driven mitigation measures for reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Reopening schools is an urgent priority as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. To explore the risks associated with returning to in-person learning and the value of mitigation measures, we developed stochastic, network-based models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in primary and secondary schools. We find that a number of mitigation measures, alone or in concert, may reduce risk to acceptable levels particularly when community prevalence is low. Student cohorting, in which students are divided into two separate populations that attend in-person classes on alternating schedules, can reduce both the likelihood and the size of outbreaks. Proactive testing of teachers and staff once or twice a week can help catch introductions early, before they spread widely through the school. In secondary schools, where the students are more susceptible to infection and have different patterns of social interaction, control is more difficult. Especially in these settings, planners should also consider testing students once or twice weekly. Vaccinating teachers and staff protects these individuals and---when vaccines block SARS-CoV-2 transmission in addition to symptoms---may also have a protective effect on students as well. Other mitigations, including mask-wearing, social distancing, and increased ventilation, remain a crucial component of any reopening plan.",Ryan Seamus McGee; Julian R. Homburger; Hannah E.

390,A 3D CNN Classification Model for Accurate Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 using Computed Tomography Images,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly around the world. As of August 25, 2020, 23.719 million people have been infected in many countries. The cumulative death toll exceeds 812,000. Early detection of COVID-19 is essential to provide patients with appropriate medical care and protect uninfected people. Leveraging a large computed tomography (CT) database from 1,112 patients provided by China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investigation (CC-CCII), we investigated multiple solutions in detecting COVID-19 and distinguished it from other common pneumonia (CP) and normal controls. We also compared the performance of different models for complete and segmented CT slices. In particular, we studied the effects of CT-superimposition depths into volumes on the performance of our models. The results show that the optimal model can identify the COVID-19 slices with 99.76% accuracy (99.96% recall, 99.35% precision and 99.65% F1-score). The overall performance for three-way classification obtained 99.24% accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9986.

391,Data Driven High Resolution Modeling and Spatial Analyses of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the world with over 90 million infections to date, and currently many countries are fighting the second wave of infections. With neither sufficient vaccination capacity nor effective medication, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remain the measure of choice. However, NPIs place a great burden on society, the mental health of individuals, and economics. Therefore the cost/benefit ratio must be carefully balanced and a target-oriented small-scale implementation of these NPIs could help achieve this balance. To this end, we introduce a modified SEIR-class compartment model and parametrize it locally for all 412 districts of Germany. The NPIs are modeled at district level by time varying contact rates. This high spatial resolution makes it possible to apply geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial patterns of the pandemic in Germany and to compare the results of different spatial resolutions. We find that the modified SEIR model can successfully be fitted to the COVID-19 cases in German districts, states, and also nationwide. We propose the correlation length as a further measure, besides the weekly incidence rates, to describe the current situation of the epidemic.",Lennart Sch&uumller; Justin M.

392,Management of conductive deafness from Otitis Media with Effusion (known as glue ear) in children using bone conduction headsets when grommet operations were unavailable during COVID-19.,"BackgroundOtitis Media with Effusion (OME) causing hearing impairments affects [~]1 in 10 children starting school in UK/ Europe. 80% have at least one episode with most having conductive hearing loss. Studies showed children with OME hear better with bone conducting headsets. During COVID-19 we investigated whether children with deafness secondary OME, without access to audiology or grommet surgery, could be aided with bone conduction kits and the HearGlueEar app.

MethodsStarting July 2020, during COVID-19, children aged 3-11 years with OME and on a grommet waiting list were invited to a single arm, prospective study. They received the kit, instructions and HearGlueEar app by post. By 3 weeks parents were asked to charge and pair the devices, attend a remote consultation and complete an OMQ-14 questionnaire. Remote follow-up lasted 3 months. Outcomes: ability to use the equipment, complete the questionnaire about childs hearing and behaviour before and with the equipment, declining grommet surgery or where deafness resolved, and give opinion about the intervention.

Findings26 children enrolled. Families used the kit at home and school. Most found remote consultations positive and convenient. OMQ-14 responses were 90% positive. Comments were: ""Other people have said, wow his speech is clearer."", ""It is making a real difference at home."", ""He said over and over again, ""I can hear everybody, wow, wow, wow."", ""It is no exaggeration to say this has made an astronomical improvement to his quality of life"". One child reported ""I can hear my best friend again"". ""She is getting on really well with the headphones - pairing them with the iPad at home is simply brilliant."" Three families continued with the headset to avoid grommets.

InterpretationPosting a bone conduction kit, HearGlueEar app and remote consultation is effective support for children with deafness secondary to OME.

394,Willingness to volunteer of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Assessment at a tertiary care hospital in India,"Background and ObjectivesThe involvement of medical students in strategies to control COVID-19 might be considered to cope with the shortage of healthcare workers. This study aims at assessing the level of knowledge about COVID-19, willingness to volunteer, potential areas of involvement and reasons for deterrence towards volunteering among medical students.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical students of a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi. A web-based questionnaire was used to elicit demographic information, knowledge of COVID-19, willingness to volunteer and reasons for deterrence for working during COVID-19 pandemic and self-declared knowledge in six domains.

ResultsA total of 292 students participated in the study with a mean age of 19.9{+/-}3.1 years. The mean (S.D.) knowledge score of COVID-19 was 6.9 (1.1) (maximum score 10). Knowledge score was significantly different among preclinical (6.5), paraclinical (7.18), and clinical groups (7.03). Almost three fourth (75.3%) participants were willing to volunteer in COVID-19 pandemic, though 67.8% had not received any training in emergency medicine or public health crisis management. Willingness to work was maximum in areas of social work and indirect patient care (62.3% each). Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a highly deterrent factor for volunteering (62.7%) followed by fear of transmitting the infection to family (45.9%), fear of causing harm to the patient (34.2%), and absence of treatment (22.2%).

Understanding the factors affecting host response is instrumental to design of therapeutics to prevent or ameliorate the course of infection.

As part of explorative tests in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection participating in ODYSSEY trial, we obtained samples for whole genome sequencing analysis as well as for viral genome sequencing. Based on our data, we confirm one of the strongest severity susceptibility locus thus far reported in association with severe COVID-19: 3p21.31 locus with lead variant rs73064425. We further examine the associated region. Interestingly based on LD analysis we report 3 coding mutations within one gene in the region of FYVE and Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1 (FYCO1). We specifically focus on the role of FYCO1 modifiers and gain-of-function variants. We report the associations between the region and clinical characteristics in this severe set of COVID-19 patients.

We next analyzed expression profiles of FYCO1 across all 466 compounds tested. We selected only those results that showed a significant reduction of expression of FYCO1. The most significant candidate was indomethacin - an anti-inflammatory that could potentially downregulate FYCO1. We hypothesize that via its direct effects on efficiency of viral egress, it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of indomethacin and other compounds downregulating FYCO1 in COVID-19 infection and other strains of betacoronaviruses.",Sandra Paulina Smieszek; Mihael H Polymeropoulos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250070,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250070,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

We report a case of a prolonged persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 associated with clinical relapses of COVID-19 in a lymphoma patient.

MethodsNasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Real time-PCR (RT-PCR). On five positive nasopharyngeal swabs, we performed viral culture and next generation sequencing. We analysed the patients adaptive and innate immunity to characterize T and NK cell subsets.

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs samples remained positive with cycle threshold mean values of 22 {+/-} 1{middle dot}3 for over 8 months. All five performed viral cultures were positive and genomic analysis confirmed a persistent infection with the same strain. Viremia resulted positive in three out of four COVID-19 clinical relapses and cleared each time after remdesivir treatment. T and NK cells dynamic was different in aviremic and viremic samples and no SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected throughout the disease course.

InterpretationIn our patient, SARS-CoV-2 persisted with proven infectivity for over eight months. Viremia was associated with COVID-19 relapses and remdesivir treatment was effective in viremia clearance and symptoms remission, although it was unable to clear the virus from the upper respiratory airways. During the viremic phase, we observed a low frequency of terminal effector CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood that are probably recruited in inflammatory tissue for viral eradication. In addition we found a high level of NK cells repertoire perturbation with a relevant involvement during SARS-CoV-2 viremia.

The cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (Genscript) is the first such commercially available assay, detecting antibodies that block RBD/ACE-2 interaction. We aimed to evaluate cPass to inform its use and assess its added value compared to anti-RBD ELISA assays.

MethodsSerum reference panels were used to compare cPass to plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies. We assessed the correlation of cPass with an ELISA detecting anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies at a single timepoint and across intervals from onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCompared to PRNT-50%, cPass had 100% sensitivity (95%CI 82-100) and 95% specificity (76-100). Sensitivity was also very high compared to the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay, but specificity was lower, ranging from 17-70%. Highest agreement between cPass and ELISA was for anti-RBD IgG (r=0.851 at 0-6 weeks; r=0.798 at > 6 weeks). Anti-RBD IgG diagnostic accuracy for detection of neutralizing antibodies was essentially identical to that of cPass.

MethodAn ODE based mathematical model was constructed by extending the classical SEIR model to predict the seroprevalence rate in Delhi. We estimated the parameter values for Delhi using available data (reported cases and the seroprevalence rate) and used them for future prediction. We also attempted to capture the changes in the seroprevalence rate with different possibilities of reinfection.

ResultsMaximum seroprevalence rate obtained through our model is 31.65% and also a reduction in the seroprevalence rate was observed for the upcoming one month (month of January, 2021) due to the reduced transmission rate. After increasing the transmission rate to the value same as the third wave in New Delhi, we obtained a maximum value of 54.96%. This maximum value significantly decreased with the reduction in the reinfection possibilities. Also, a little impact of the duration of persistence of antibodies, 180 vs 105 days, was observed on the maximum seroprevalence.

Here, we develop a modular method for high-yield extraction of viral single-stranded nucleic acids by using  capture ssDNA sequences attached to carbon nanotubes. Target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be captured by ssDNA-nanotube constructs via hybridization and separated from the liquid phase in a single-tube system with minimal chemical reagents, for downstream quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection. This nanotube-based extraction method enables 100% extraction yield of target SARS-CoV-2 RNA from phosphate buffered saline in comparison to [~]20% extraction yield when instead using a commercial silica-column kit. Notably, carbon nanotubes enable extraction of nucleic acids directly from 50% human saliva, bypassing the need for further biofluid purification and avoiding the use of DNA/RNA extraction kits. Carbon nanotube-based extraction of viral nucleic acids facilitates high-yield and high-sensitivity identification of viral nucleic acids such as the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome with reduced reliance on reagents affected by supply chain obstacles.

402,Oral ulcers of COVID-19 patients: a scoping review protocol,"ObjectiveThis scoping review aims to systematically identify the types, characteristics, and possible pathophysiologic etiologies of the oral ulcers that emerge in COVID-19 patients.

IntroductionThe oral cavity is a vulnerable niche for the most diverse microbial ecosystem in the human body; therefore, it presents a wide array of mucocutaneous complications that could indicate various acute and chronic conditions. The COVID-19-related oral conditions, including oral ulcers, had been widely debated as direct manifestations or indirect complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to a preliminary search of PROSPERO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the JBI Evidence Synthesis, there is no published nor registered scoping review concerned with the oral ulcers of COVID-19 patients.

Inclusion criteriaThe review will include studies included COVID-19 patients whose infection had been confirmed by RT-PCR testing regardless of infection severity and clinical course. Only the studies that reported COVID-19 patients with oral ulcers.

MethodsA three-phase search strategy will be carried out: an initial limited search, a full electronic search, and hand search using the reference lists of all included records. The main bibliographic databases of published literature will include MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, EMBASE via Ovid, and Scopus. All identified records will be managed using EndNote 9.2, and the titles and abstracts will be screened against the inclusion criteria before the full text of all potentially relevant studies will be examined. The data will be presented in tabular form, rating maps, and narrative summary.

404,Projected spread of COVID-19's second wave in South Africa under different levels of lockdown,"South Africa is currently experiencing a second wave of resurgence in COVID-19 infection. In this modelling study, we use a Bayesian compartmental model to project possible spread of the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa under various levels of lockdown restrictions. Our model suggests that strict lockdown restrictions will have to be in place up to the end of March 2021 before cases can drop to levels observed, in September to early November 2020, after the first wave. On the one hand, extended lockdown restrictions have negative consequences - albeit effective, they are not sustainable over extended periods. On the other hand, short lockdown restrictions over a few weeks will not have a lasting effect on the spread of the disease. Lockdown restrictions need to be supplemented with increased rapid testing, palliative support for the vulnerable, and implementations of other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mask mandate. These multifaceted approaches could help keep cases under control until vaccines are widely available.",Elisha B Are; Caroline B Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250308,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250308,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

In the midst of the COVID19 pandemic, this presents an opportunity for active cases to be introduced into a community. Prior to the Fall 2020 semester, Colorado State University researchers combined student home locations with recent case counts compiled by the New York Times to assign a probability to each individual of arriving with COVID19. These probabilities were combined to estimate that there would be 7.8 new cases among the on-campus population. Comprehensive testing of arriving students revealed 7 new cases, which validated the approach. The procedure was repeated to explore what could happen if students had returned to campus after Fall break. The estimate of 48 cases corroborated the Universitys early decision to transition to fully remote learning after break.",Alex Fout; Jude Bayham; Margaret J Gutilla; Bailey K Fosdick; Heather Pidcoke; Michael Kirby; Peter Jan van Leeuwen; Chuck Anderson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250120,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250120,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

We assessed persistent symptoms in pediatric patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19. More than a half reported at least one persisting symptom even after 120 days since COVID-19, with 42.6% being impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly frequent, as also described in adults.

407,Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in haemodialysis patients and protection against reinfection,"BackgroundPatients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) have had high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following infection, ICHD patients frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the durability and functionality of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in ICHD patients.

MethodsThree hundred and fifty-six ICHD patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies. Patients who became seronegative at 6 months were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses.

ResultsOne hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at Time 0, of which 127 (98.4%) also had detectable anti-RBD. At 6 months, of 111 patients tested, 71(64.0%) and 97 (87.4%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive respectively, p<0.001. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels reduced significantly after 6 months. Ten patients who were anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive at Time 0, had no detectable antibody at 6 months; of which 8 were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses.

Independent of antibody status at 6 months, patients with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 serology were significantly less likely to have PCR confirmed infection over the following 6 months.

ConclusionsICHD patients mount durable immune responses 6 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with <3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity. These immune responses are associated with a reduced risk of subsequent reinfection.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFollowing infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. Patients with ESKD receiving in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) have had high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. What is not known is how durable the serological responses in ESKD patients are or whether evidence of prior immune responses protect patients from reinfection. In this study of 356 ICHD patients, at 6 months following the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, fewer than 3% of patients lacked evidence of either humoral or cellular immunity. Furthermore, patients with serological evidence of infection had a significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with subsequent infection or  reinfection, suggesting functional immune protection.",Candice L Clarke; Maria Prendecki; Amrita Dhutia; Claire Edwards; Virginia Prout; Liz Lightstone; Eleanor Parker; Federica Marchesin; Megan Griffith; Rawya Charif; Graham Pickard; Alison Cox; Myra McClure; Richard Tedder; Paul Randell; Louise Greathead; Mary Guckian; Stephen P McAdoo; Peter Kelleher; Michelle Willicombe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249865,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249865,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
408,"Assessment of the knowledge, preferences and concern regarding the prospective COVID- 19 vaccine among adults residing in New Delhi, India-A cross-sectional study.","BackgroundUnderstanding the perception and concerns of people about COVID-19 vaccine in developing and populous country like India will help in understanding demand for the vaccine and further tailoring out public health information and education activities before the launch of the vaccine. The study was carried out to assess the present state of knowledge people have about the probable vaccine for COVID-19, to know the preferences of respondents about this vaccine and to learn the expectations and apprehensions of people about features of this prospective COVID-19 vaccine residing in the capital city of India.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted amongst the residents of Delhi, India from July-October 2020. Both offline and online interview method was used to collect date from 513 participants representing various occupational strata. Data was collected on socio demographic variable, vaccine acceptance and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsAmong the study population 79.5% said they will take the vaccine while 8.8% said they were not going to take the vaccine and remaining 11.7% had not yet decided about it. Most of them(78.8%),believed that vaccine would be available to public next year but at the same time half(50.1%) of them believe that it may not be in sufficient amount for everyone to get. More than 50% were willing to pay for the vaccine and 72% felt vaccine should first be given to health workers and high risk group.

ConclusionThe following study has helped to understand the percentage of people who are hesitant to take the vaccine and also the concerns regarding the vaccine. Also since half of the population is willing to pay for the vaccine, a strategical approach considering the various economical classes of people could be applied in a developing country like India.",Farzana Islam; Rashmi Agarwalla; Meely Panda; Yasir Alvi; Vishal Singh; Arup Debroy; Arindam Ray; Amruta Vadnerkar; Shraddha Uttekar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250164,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250164,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

410,CovidArray: a microarray-based assay with high sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs,"BackgroundA new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current Covid-19 epidemic. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under ideal conditions RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%. However, when the sample panel is enlarged including asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity decreases and false-negative are reported. Moreover, RT-qPCR requires up to 3-6 hours with most of the time involved in RNA extraction from swab samples.

MethodsWe introduce CovidArray, a microarray-based assay, to detect SARS-CoV-2 markers N1 and N2 in the nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on solid phase hybridization of fluorescently labelled amplicons upon RNA extraction and reverse transcription. This approach combines the physical-optical properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to coat the substrate to obtain a diagnostic tool of great sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an innovative approach, RNAGEM, to extract and purify viral RNA in less than 15 minutes. To validate the CovidArray results, we exploited the high sensitivity of the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technique.

ResultWe correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analyzed by RT-qPCR. Thanks to the CovidArray sensitivity that matches that of the ddPCR, we were able to identify a false-negative sample.

ConclusionsCovidArray is the first DNA microarray-based assay to detect viral genes in the swabs. Its high sensitivity and the innovative viral RNA extraction by RNAGEM allows to reduce both the amount of false negative results and the total analysis time to about 2 hours.",Francesco Damin; Silvia Galbiati; Stella Gagliardi; Cristina Cereda; Francesca Dragoni; Claudio Fenizia; Valeria Savasi; Laura Sola; Marcella Chiari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250281,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250281,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

Study DESIGNSingle-center, open label, randomised controlled trial.

SETTINGWuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, February 27 to March 27, 2020.

PARTICIPANTS204 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were randomised in to treatment group and control group, which was 102 patients each group.

INTERVENTIONSIn treatment group, Q-14 was administrated at 10g (granules), twice daily for 14 days and plus standard care. In control group, patients were given standard care alone for 14 days.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREThe primary outcome was conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population.

RESULTSAmong 204 patients, 195 were analyzed according to the intention to treat principle. There were 149 patients (71 vs. 78 in treatment group and control group respectively) turning to negative via SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No statistically significance showed in conversion time between treatment group and control group (FAS: Median (IQR): 10.00 (9.00-11.00) vs. 10.00 (9.00-11.00); Mean rank: 67.92 vs. 81.44; P=0.051.). Time to recovery of fever was shorter in treatment group as compared in control group. The disappearance rate of symptom in cough, fatigue, chest discomfort was significantly higher in treatment group. In chest computed tomography (Chest CT) examinations, overall evaluation of chest CT examination after treatment compared with baseline showed more patients improved in treatment group .There were no significant differences in the other outcomes.

CONCLUSIONAdministration of Q-14 on standard care for COVID-19 was useful for improvement of symptoms (such as fever, cough, fatigue and chest discomfort), while did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No serious adverse events were reported.

It has been shown, however, that both viral particles and antibodies against those particles are present in saliva, which is more accessible than both swabs and blood. We present methods for highly sensitive measurements of both viral RNA and serology from the same saliva sample. We developed an efficient saliva RNA extraction method and combined it with an ultrasensitive serology test based on Single Molecule Array (Simoa) technology. We apply our test to the saliva of patients who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, some of whom tested positive with a conventional RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal swab test.

Apart from the lung, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple organs in severe cases. Less is known on organ tropism in patients developing mild or no symptoms, and some of such patients might be missed in symptom-indicated swab testing.

Here we tested and validated several approaches and selected the most reliable RT-PCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients routine diagnostic formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens available in pathology, to assess a) organ tropism in samples from COVID-19-positive patients, b) unrecognized cases in selected tissues from negative or not-tested patients during a pandemic peak, and c) retrospectively, pre-pandemic lung samples.

We identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in four samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients, in two gastric biopsies, one colon resection, and one pleural effusion specimen, while all other specimens, particularly from patients with mild COVID-19 disease course, were negative. In the pandemic peak cohort, we identified one previously unrecognized COVID-19 case in tonsillectomy samples. All pre-pandemic lung samples were negative.

415,"Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Brazil is the third country most affected by Covid-19 pandemic. In spite of this, viral evolution in municipality resolution is poorly understood in Brazil and it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of viral spread. We identified four main circulating lineages in Esteio (Southern Brazil) and their relationship with global, national and regional lineages using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We provided a comprehensive view of viral mutations from a time- and age-representative sampling from May to October 2020, in Esteio (RS, Brazil), highlighting two frequent mutations in Spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the South African lineage B.1.351, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). A significant viral diversity was evidenced with the identification of 80 different SNPs. The E484K replacement was found in two genomes (9.5%) from samples obtained in mid-October, which is to our best knowledge the earliest description of E484K harboring SARS-CoV-2 in South Brazil. This mutation identified in a small municipality from the RS state demonstrates that it was probably widely distributed in the Brazilian territory, but went unnoticed so far by the lack of genomic surveillance in Brazil. The introduction of E484K mutants shows temporal correlation with later increases in new cases in our state. Importantly, since it has been associated with immune evasion and enhanced interaction with hACE-2, lineages containing this substitution must be the subject of intense surveillance. Our date demonstrates multiple introductions of the most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the major role of community transmission in viral spreading and the establishment of Brazilian lineages.

416,Magnitude and timing of the antiviral response determine SARS-CoV-2 replication early in infection,"The interferon response is a potent antiviral defense mechanism, but its effectiveness depends on its timing relative to viral replication. Here, we report viral replication and host response kinetics in patients at the start of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore the impact of these kinetics experimentally. In both longitudinal patient nasopharyngeal samples and airway epithelial organoids, we found that SARS-CoV-2 initially replicated exponentially with a doubling time of [~]6hr, and induced interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) with delayed timing relative to viral replication. Prior exposure to rhinovirus increased ISG levels and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication. Conversely, inhibiting ISG induction abrogated interference by rhinovirus and enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication rate. These results demonstrate the importance of initial interferon-mediated defenses in determining the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 can replicate at the start of infection and indicate that biological variables that alter the airway interferon response, including heterologous induction of innate immunity by other viruses, could profoundly impact SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and transmission.",Nagarjuna R.

417,Dynamic change and clinical relevance of post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.,"BackgroundAlthough reports suggest that most individuals with COVID-19 develop detectable antibodies post infection, the kinetics, durability, and relative differences between IgM and IgG responses beyond the first few weeks after symptom onset remain poorly understood.

MethodsWithin a large, well-phenotyped, diverse, prospective cohort of subjects with and without SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infection and historical controls derived from cohorts with high prevalence of viral coinfections and samples taken during prior flu seasons, we measured SARS-CoV-2 serological responses (both IgG and IgM) using commercially available assays. We calculated sensitivity and specificity, relationship with disease severity and mapped the kinetics of antibody responses over time using generalised additive models.

ResultsWe analysed 1,001 samples from 752 subjects, 327 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (29.7% with severe disease) spanning a period of 90 days from symptom onset. Sensitivity was lower (44.1-47.1%) early (<10 days) after symptom onset but increased to >80% after 10 days. IgM positivity increased earlier than IgG-targeted assays but positivity peaked between day 32 and 38 post onset of symptoms and declined thereafter, a dynamic that was confirmed when antibody levels were analysed, with more rapid decline observed with IgM. Early (<10 days) IgM but not IgG levels were significantly higher in those who subsequently developed severe disease (signal / cut-off 4.20 (0.75-17.93) versus 1.07 (0.21-5.46), P=0.048).

Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 42.86% (95% CI: 9.90% to 81.59%), 71.43% (95% CI: 29.04% to 96.33%), and 28.57% (95% CI: 13.22% to 48.67%) for samples collected on 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and 2-8 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 97.53% (95% CI: 93.80% to 99.32%). There was no cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody Hemoglobin (200 mg/dL), bilirubin (2 mg/dL), triglyceride (250 mg/dL) and EDTA (10 mM) showed no significant interfering effect on this assay. In conclusion, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody assay with high sensitivity and specificity has been developed. With the high throughput, this assay will speed up the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM testing.",Dayu Zhang; Tianyang Xu; Eric Chu; Aiguo Zhang; Jinwei Du; Michael Sha,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.20249050,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.20249050,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
419,Assessment of The Relationship of REMS and MEWS Scores with Prognosis in Patients Diagnosed with Covid-19 Admitted to the Emergency Department,"AimWith the rapid and global increase in COVID-19 cases, it is becoming important to identify patients with a risk of mortality and patients that need hospitalization. The aim of this study is to try to predict the mortality rate of COVID patients admitted to the emergency department with rapid scoring systems such as REMS and MEWS and their clinical termination in the emergency department at the end of the first month.

MethodWe have designed this study to be a single-centered, prospective and an observational study. A total of 392 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, who were admitted to the emergency department in a 1-month period, were included in the study. REMS and MEWS scores were calculated for each case. Demographic data of patients, clinical outcomes such as discharge, service hospitalization, ICU hospitalization, and first-month mortality were analysed based on these scores. ROC curves were analysed to determine the cut-off value with the help of which REMS and MEWS scores can predict 1-month mortality and hospitalization.

ResultsOut of the 392 patients included in the study, the 43.4% (n=170) were female and 56.6% (n=222) were male. The average age of our patients was 48.98{+/-}19.49 years. The 1-month mortality rate of our patients was 4.3% (n=17). At the end of the first month, the mortality of patients with a comorbid disease was higher than those who did not (p<0.01). The average of the REMS score was higher in patients with an average mortality of (7.24{+/-}3.77) than in patients without it (2.87{+/-}3.09), and there was a statistically significant difference between them (p<0.01). Similarly, the average of the MEWS score was higher in patients with an average mortality of (2.76{+/-}1.86) than in patients without it (1.65{+/-}1.35), and there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.01). The REMS score of patients admitted to the service was higher than that of patients discharged (p<0.01). When the REMS score was determined as 3 cut-off value in ROC analysis, service hospitalization was 5 times higher in patients with a REMS score of 3 and above than in those who were discharged (OR: 1:5.022 95% CI: 3.088-8.168)). REMS and MEWS scores were also higher in ICU patients than in discharged patients (p<0.01).

ConclusionIn predicting the 1-month mortality of ER patients diagnosed with COVID-19, REMS and MEWS scoring systems can be useful and guiding in determining the patients who need hospitalization for emergency physicians. The use of these scoring systems in emergency departments can help predict the clinical outcomes of patients at the time of the initial evaluation, and can also be a practical method of predicting the prognosis of the patients.",Behlul Bas; Mucahit Senturk; Tugce Nur Burnaz; Kubilay Timur; Asim Kalkan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250384,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250384,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
420,"Estimates of global SARS-CoV-2 infection exposure, infection morbidity, and infection mortality rates","We aimed to estimate, albeit crudely and provisionally, national, regional, and global proportions of respective populations that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to assess infection morbidity and mortality rates, factoring both documented and undocumented infections. The estimates were generated by applying mathematical models to 159 countries and territories. The percentage of the worlds population that has been infected as of 31 December 2020 was estimated at 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%). It was lowest in the Western Pacific Region at 0.66% (95% CI: 0.59-0.75%) and highest in the Americas at 41.92% (95% CI: 37.95-46.09%). The global infection fatality rate was 10.73 (95% CI: 10.21-11.29) per 10,000 infections. Globally per 1,000 infections, the infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate was 19.22 (95% CI: 18.73-19.51), the infection ICU bed hospitalization rate was 4.14 (95% CI: 4.10-4.18), the infection severity rate was 6.27 (95% CI: 6.18-6.37), and the infection criticality rate was 2.26 (95% CI: 2.24-2.28). If left unchecked with no interventions, the pandemic would eventually cause 8.18 million (95% CI: 7.30-9.18) deaths, 163.67 million (95% CI: 148.12-179.51) acute-care hospitalizations, 33.01 million (95% CI: 30.52-35.70) ICU hospitalizations, 50.23 million (95% CI: 46.24-54.67) severe cases, and 17.62 million (95% CI: 16.36-18.97) critical cases.

421,"Trends, regional variation, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 vaccine recipients: a retrospective cohort study in 23.4 million patients using OpenSAFELY.","BackgroundOn December 8th 2020, NHS England administered the first COVID-19 vaccination as part of an ambitious vaccination programme during a global health emergency.

AimsTo develop a framework for detailed near-real-time monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out; to describe trends and variation in coverage by geographic area, and between key clinical and demographic patient groups.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England we used routine clinical data from 23.4 million patients to conduct a retrospective cohort study of comprehensive electronic health record data in NHS England, using the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform which covers approximately 40% of the general population in England with weekly data updates. We developed algorithms to identify key demographic and clinical sub-groups within this population and generated descriptive statistics on proportion of eligible patients receiving the vaccine among key Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) target groups.

ResultsBetween December 8th and January 13th 961,580 people out of 23.4m in our dataset received a COVID-19 vaccine. Of 1,160,062 patients aged 80 or over and not living in a care home (currently targeted by JCVI) 476,375 had been vaccinated in total (41.1%). We observed a substantial divergence in vaccination by ethnicity within this group (White 42.5% vaccinated, Black 20.5%) and across rankings of deprivation (least deprived 44.7%, most deprived 37.9%). Patients with pre-existing medical conditions were equally likely, or more likely, to have received a vaccine across most co-morbidity groups with two exceptions: severe mental illness (30.3% vaccinated) and learning disability (28.1%). We identify substantial variation in vaccination among the over-80s between Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs; Range 12%-74%); lower vaccination rates among ethnic minority and deprived groups was observed in most but not all STPs. In the 70-79 age cohort 74,108 people (3.6%) had been vaccinated. 378,921 vaccine recipients under 70 and not identifiably resident in a care home were presumed to be health or social care workers; 32,174 recipients were identified as older aged care home residents (33.2% coverage). Of all those vaccinated, 169,472 had received a second dose (17.6%).

ConclusionsThe NHS in England has rapidly delivered mass vaccination. We were able to deploy a data monitoring framework across small clinical subgroups using linked patient-level NHS data on 23.4 million people with very short delays from vaccine administration to completed analysis. Targeted activity may be needed to address lower vaccination rates observed among certain key groups: ethnic minorities, people living in areas of higher deprivation, and those with severe mental illness or learning disabilities. However we note that this data is only from the first preliminary weeks of the vaccination programme. Variation in vaccination coverage between groups and regions will have many complex drivers, the figures presented in this manuscript require thoughtful interpretation to support a rapidly evolving NHS vaccination campaign; we are sharing local level data with national and regional NHS teams on request.",Brian MacKenna; Helen J Curtis; Caroline E Morton; Peter Inglesby; Alex J Walker; Jessica Morley; Amir Mehrkar; Sebastian CJ Bacon; George Hickman; Christopher Bates; Richard Croker; David Evans; Tom Ward; Jonathan Cockburn; Simon Davy; Krishnan Bhaskaran; Anna Schultze; Christopher T Rentsch; Elizabeth J Williamson; William J Hulme; Helen I McDonald; Laurie Tomlinson; Rohini Mathur; Henry Drysdale; Rosalind M Eggo; Kevin Wing; Angel YS Wong; Harriet Forbes; Ian J Douglas; John Parry; Frank Hester; Sam Harper; Stephen JW Evans; Liam Smeeth; Ben Goldacre,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250356,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250356,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
422,Factors influencing nursing students' intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination - A pooled analysis of seven countries,"Experiencing the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, high vaccination coverage by a safe and effective vaccine globally would be a great achievement. Acceptance of vaccination by healthcare students is an important issue as they have a key role as future professionals in educating patients, informing and guiding them to the right clinical decision. The aim of this study was to explore the intention of nursing students to get vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the factors acting either as motivators or barriers towards vaccination. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in 7 countries (Greece, Albania, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic and Kosovo) through a web survey. In total 2249 undergraduate nursing students participated. Forty three point eight percent of students agreed to accept a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, while the acceptance was higher among Italian students. The factors for intention to get vaccinated were male gender (p=0.008), no working experience in healthcare facilities during the pandemic (p=0.001), vaccination for influenza in 2019 and 2020 (p<0.001), trust in doctors (p<0.001), governments and experts (p=0.012), high level of knowledge (p<0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (p<0.001). Understanding of factors that influence students decision to accept COVID-19 vaccination could increase the acceptance rate contributing to a management of the pandemic.

423,Patients with Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) have increased levels of plasma inflammatory mediators upregulated in severe COVID-19,"BackgroundRespiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been associated with increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the mechanisms and putative immune pathways are unclear. Besides, increased levels of several immune mediators in patients with severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been reported.

ObjectiveTo perform an immunoproteomic profiling of dysregulated plasma proteins in patients with asthma and COPD and to evaluate their relationship with biomarkers of severe COVID-19.

Methods92 protein biomarkers were quantified in 315 plasma samples from adult subjects (age 40-90 years) including 118 asthmatics, 99 COPD patients and 98 healthy controls, that have been recruited in two reference pneumology clinics in Colombia before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsForty-one plasma proteins showed differences between patients and controls. Asthmatic patients have increased levels in IL-6 and CCL3 while COPD patients have a broader systemic inflammatory dysregulation driven by HGF, OPG, and several chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CX3CL1, CXCL1, MCP-3, MCP-4, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL11). Functional annotation revealed their enrichment in chemokine signaling pathways related with response to viral infections. Some of these proteins were found up-regulated upon SARS-Cov-2 infection of Calu-3 cells. Also, HPG, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, MCP-3, TNF and EN-RAGE have been found increased in patients with severe COVID-19. HGF, the most significant protein in this study as well as its correlated proteins could be associated with the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in COPD patients.

ConclusionsAsthma and COPD patients have altered plasma levels of proteins that have been found associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. The reasons for sharing these profiles with this infection are unknown, but our study suggest that adult patients with asthma and COPD have a systemic dysregulation in chemokine networks that could make them more susceptible to severe COVID-19.",Nathalie Acevedo; Jose Miguel Escamilla-Gil; Hector Espinoza; Ronald Regino; Jonathan Ramirez; Lucila Florez De Arco; Rodolfo Dennis; Carlos Torres-Duque; Luis Caraballo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250370,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250370,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
424,Contamination of air and surfaces in workplaces with SARS-CoV-2 virus: a systematic review,"ObjectivesThis systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence for air and surface contamination of workplace environments with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the quality of the methods used to identify actions necessary to improve the quality of the data.

MethodsWe searched Web of Science and Google Scholar until 24th December 2020 for relevant articles and extracted data on methodology and results.

ResultsThe vast majority of data come from healthcare settings, with typically around 6 % of samples having detectable concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and almost none of the samples collected had viable virus. There were a wide variety of methods used to measure airborne virus, although surface sampling was generally undertaken using nylon flocked swabs. Overall, the quality of the measurements was poor. Only a small number of studies reported the airborne concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, mostly just reporting the detectable concentration values without reference to the detection limit. Imputing the geometric mean air concentration assuming the limit of detection was the lowest reported value, suggests typical concentrations in health care settings may be around 0.01 SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA copies/m3. Data on surface virus loading per unit area were mostly unavailable.

ConclusionThe reliability of the reported data is uncertain. The methods used for measuring SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in work environments should be standardised to facilitate more consistent interpretation of contamination and to help reliably estimate worker exposure.

425,Impulse dispersion of aerosols during playing wind instruments,"Musical activities especially singing and playing wind instruments have been singled out as potentially high-risk activities for transmission of SARS CoV-2, because of a higher rate of aerosol production and emission. Playing wind instruments can produce condensation water, droplets of saliva, and aerosol particles, which hover and convectional spread in the environmental air and can be potentially infectious.

The aim of this study is to investigate the primary impulse dispersion of aerosols during playing different wind instruments in comparison to breathing and speaking. Nine professional musicians (3 trumpeters, 3 cross flutists and 3 clarinetists) of the Bavarian Symphony Orchestra performed the main theme of Ludwig van Beethoven s 9th symphony, 4th movement in different pitches and loudness. Thereby, the inhaled air volume was marked with small aerosol particles produced with a commercial e-cigarette. The expelled aerosol cloud was recorded by cameras from different perspectives. Afterwards, the dimensions and dynamics of the aerosol cloud was measured by segmenting the video footage at every time point.

Overall, the cross flutes produced the largest dispersion at the end of task of up to maximum distances of 1.88 m in front direction. Thereby it was observed an expulsion of aerosol in different directions: upwards and downwards at the mouthpiece, at the end of the instrument and along the cross flute at the key plane. In comparison, the maximum impulse dispersion generated by the trumpets and clarinets were lower in frontal and lateral direction (1.2 m and 1.0 m in front-direction). The expulsion to the sides was also lower. Consequently, a distance of 3 m to the front and to the sides of 2 m for the cross flutes in an orchestral formation is proposed, for trumpets and clarinets a safety distance of 2 m to the front and 1.5 m between instrumentalists are recommendable.",Sophia Gantner; Matthias Echternach; Reinhard Veltrup; Caroline Westphalen; Marie Christine Koeberlein; Liudmila Kuranova; Gregor Peters; Bernhard Jakubass; Tobias Benthaus; Michael Doellinger; Stefan Kniesburges,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.20248984,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.20248984,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
426,Novel COVID-19 phenotype definitions reveal phenotypically distinct patterns of genetic association and protective effects,"INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPHMultiple large COVID-19 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified reproducible genetic associations indicating that some infection susceptibility and severity risk is heritable.1-5 Most of these studies ascertained COVID-19 cases in medical clinics and hospitals, which can lead to an overrepresentation of cases with severe outcomes, such as hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or ventilation. Here, we demonstrate the utility and validity of deep phenotyping with self-reported outcomes in a population with a large proportion of mild and subclinical cases. Using these data, we defined eight different phenotypes related to COVID-19 outcomes: four that align with previously studied COVID-19 definitions and four novel definitions that focus on susceptibility given exposure, mild clinical manifestations, and an aggregate score of symptom severity. We assessed replication of 13 previously identified COVID-19 genetic associations with all eight phenotypes and found distinct patterns of association, most notably related to the chr3/SLC6A20/LZTFL1 and chr9/ABO regions. We then performed a discovery GWAS, which suggested some novel phenotypes may better capture protective associations and also identified a novel association in chr11/GALNT18 that reproduced in two fully independent populations.",Genevieve H.L.

427,Biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundSeveral studies have reported that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly infect endothelial cells, and endothelial dysfunction is often found in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To better understand the pathological mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess biomarkers of endothelial cells in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsA literature search was conducted on online databases for observational studies evaluating biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and composite poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

ResultsA total of 1187 patients from 17 studies were included in this analysis. The estimated pooled means for von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen levels in COVID-19 patients was higher compared to healthy control (306.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 291.37-321.48], p<0.001; I2:86%), with the highest VWF antigen levels was found in deceased COVID-19 patients (448.57 [95% CI 407.20-489.93], p<0.001; I2:0%). Meta-analysis showed that higher plasma levels of VWF antigen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (PAI-1) antigen, and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) were associated with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 patients ([standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.74 [0.33-1.16], p<0.001; I2:80.4%], [SMD 0.55 [0.19-0.92], p=0.003; I2:6.4%], [SMD 0.33 [0.04-0.62], p=0.025; I2:7.9%], and [SMD 0.55 [0.10-0.99], p=0.015; I2:23.6%], respectively).

ConclusionThe estimated pooled means shows increased levels of VWF antigen in COVID-19 patients. Several biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, including VFW antigen, t-PA, PAI-1, and sTM, are significantly associated with increased composite poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.

429,Identification of COVID-19 Subtypes Based on Immunogenomic Profiling,"Although previous studies have shown that the host immune response is crucial in determining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the association between host immune signatures and COVID-19 patient outcomes remains unclear. Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immune-inhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was an adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19.

430,ESCAPE: An Open-Label Trial of Personalized Immunotherapy in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients,"RationaleMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and complex immune dysregulation (CID) often underlie acute respiratory distress (ARDS) in COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo investigate the outcome of personalized immunotherapy in critical COVID-19.

MethodsIn this open-label prospective trial, 102 patients with SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score [&ge;]2 or ARDS by SARS-CoV-2 were screened for MAS (ferritin more than 4420 ng/ml) and CID (ferritin [&le;]4420 ng/ml and low expression of HLA-DR on CD14-monocytes). Patients with MAS and CID with increased aminotransferases were assigned to intravenous anakinra; those with CID and normal aminotransferases to tocilizumab. The primary outcome was at least 25% decrease of SOFA score and/or 50% increase of respiratory ratio by day 8; 28-day mortality, change of SOFA score by day 28; serum biomarkers and cytokine production by mononuclear cells were secondary endpoints.

Measurements and Main ResultsThe primary study endpoint was met in 58.3% of anakinra-treated patients and in 33.3% of tocilizumab-treated patients (odds ratio 3.11; 95% CIs 1.29-7.73; P: 0.011). No differences were found in mortality and in SOFA score changes. By day 4, ferritin was decreased among anakinra-treated patients; interleukin (IL)-6, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and the expression of HLA-DR were increased among tocilizumab-treated patients. Anakinra increased capacity of mononuclear cells to produce IL-6. Survivors by day 28 who received anakinra were distributed to scales of the WHO clinical progression of lower severity. Greater incidence of secondary infections was found with tocilizumab treatment.

ConclusionsBiomarkers may guide favourable anakinra responses in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

431,Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: As a double edge sword for COVID-19?,"BackgroundHydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin was one of the common therapies at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. They can prolong QT interval, cause Torsade de pointes, and lead to sudden cardiac death. We aimed to assess QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin.

MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study. 172 patients with COVID-19 included, hospitalized at hospitals of Babol University of Medical Sciences between March 5, 2020, and April 3, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Electrocardiograms were used for outcome assessment.

Results83.1% of patients received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin vs 16.9% of patients who received only hydroxychloroquine. The mean age of patients was 59.2 {+/-} 15.4. The mean of post-treatment QTc interval in the monotherapy group was shorter than the mean of post-treatment QTc interval in the combination therapy group but it had no significant statistical difference (462.5 {+/-} 43.1 milliseconds vs 464.3 {+/-} 59.1 milliseconds; P = 0.488). Generally, 22.1% of patients had a prolonged QTc interval after treatment. Male gender, or baseline QTc [&ge;] 450 milliseconds, or high-risk Tisdale score increased the likelihood of prolonged QTc interval. Due to QTc prolongation, 14 patients did not continue therapy after 4 days.

ConclusionHospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, had no significant difference in prolongation of QT interval and outcome. But the number of patients with prolonged QT intervals in this study emphasizes careful cardiac monitoring during therapy; especially in high-risk patients.",Seyed Parsa Eftekhar; Sohrab Kazemi; Mohammad Barary; Mostafa Javanian; Soheil Ebrahimpour; Naghmeh Ziaei,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249941,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249941,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
432,Molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 - a regional to global perspective,"BackgroundAfter a year of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a highly dynamic genetic diversity is surfacing. Among nearly 1000 reported virus lineages, dominant lineages such as B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 attract media attention with questions regarding vaccine efficiency and transmission potential. In response to the pandemic, the Jena University Hospital began sequencing SARS-CoV-2 samples in Thuringia in early 2020.

MethodsViral RNA was sequenced in tiled amplicons using Nanopore sequencing. Subsequently, bioinformatic workflows were used to process the generated data. As a genomic background, 9,642 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes (1,917 of German origin) were extracted from more than 300.000 genomes.

ResultsIn a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we have set Thuringian isolates in the German, European and global context. In Thuringia, a largely rural German region without an international airport and a population density below the German average, we discovered many of the common ""EU lineages"". German samples are scattered across eight major clades, and Thuringian samples occupy four of them.

ConclusionThe rapid emergence and spread of novel variants are of great concern as these lineages could transmit more efficiently, evade current vaccine efforts or undermine diagnostic test accuracy. To anticipate and mitigate these threats, a continuous molecular surveillance is essential.

Key messagesO_LIBioinformatics analysis of 1,917, 4,251, and 3,474 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Germany, the EU (except Germany), and non-EU, respectively, subsampled from more than 300,000 public genomes and placed in the context of Thuringian sequences
C_LIO_LIConstant antigenic drift for SARS-CoV-2 and no clear pattern or clustering is visible in Thuringia based on the current number of samples
C_LIO_LICurrently over 100 described lineages are identified in Germany and only a subset (9) are detected in Thuringia so far, most likely due to genetic undersampling
C_LIO_LIFrom a national perspective, it is likely that high-frequency lineages, which are currently spreading throughout Europe, will eventually also reach Thuringia
C_LIO_LISystematic and dense molecular surveillance via whole-genome sequencing is needed to detect concerning new lineages early, limit spread and adjust vaccines if necessary

433,"Post-Disease Divergence in SARS-CoV-2 RNA Detection between Nasopharyngeal, Anterior Nares and Saliva/Oral Fluid Specimens - Significant Implications for Policy & Public Health","BackgroundPatients have been shown to shed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens for over 100 days after resolution of clinical disease (1, 2). How this relates to anterior nares and oral fluid specimens has not previously been investigated.

MethodsWe prospectively collected oral fluid, anterior nares, NP swab and serum specimens from 1,326 individuals at 2 ""drive-through"" testing locations. The Curative SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Curative Assay)(3) on oral fluid and anterior nares specimens was compared to the EURORealTime SARS-CoV-2 Assay (EuroRT Assay)(4) on anterior nares and NP specimens. Viral culture and IgG serology were used to assess infectious potential and stage of disease.

Additionally we investigated differences in viral RNA detection between specimen types, both early (< 21 days) and late (> 21 days) in SARS-CoV-2 infection, by using an employee surveillance program with daily SARS-CoV-2 testing to precisely determine infection date, even without symptoms. We prospectively collected oral fluid, anterior nares and NP swab specimens from 165 subjects with early infections and 22 subjects with late infections. Specimens were tested using the Curative Assay with the ""high-sensitivity"" Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Hologic Assay)(5) on an NP swab used as the comparator. Late infection specimens were also tested with EuroRT and Zymo Quick SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR Kit (Zymo) (6) Assays.

ResultsThe ""drive-through"" study showed similar sensitivities of oral fluid and anterior nares specimens on the Curative Assay to anterior nares specimens tested with the EuroRT Assay. However NP specimens tested with the same EuroRT assay produced 20-30% more positives. Incorporating viral culture and serology data to exclude NP RT-PCR positives that are not infectious or late in the course of disease showed a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) for of 98.2% and 96.2% and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of 97.6% and 98.1% for anterior nares and oral fluid specimens, respectively.

Within 21 days of infection, the Curative Assay showed a PPA and NPA of 100% and 100%, respectively for oral fluid; of 100% and 99% respectively for anterior nares; and of 98.2% and 99.0%, respectively in nasopharyngeal specimens compared to an NP specimen on the Hologic Assay. 29 positives were asymptomatic and showed 100% PPA and 100% NPA for all specimen types. After 21 days from infection onset, significant divergence between NP and other specimen types occurred on all 4 assays. Out of 22 paired sample sets, 18, 13, 8 and 4 NP specimens were positive on the Curative, Zymo, Hologic and EuroRT assays, respectively, compared to only 3, 2, 0 and 1 positive anterior nares specimens. Only one oral fluid sample was positive in both the Curative and Zymo assays.

ConclusionsWe used a unique population to show significant divergence between NP specimens and anterior nares or oral fluid specimens >21 days from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears to be biological variation and is independent of assay used. This has significant public health implications for the use of NP specimens in community testing programs and policy implications for evaluation of novel specimen types and tests where the use of NP swabs as a comparator may say more about the study population than the assay or specimen type to be evaluated and may unnecessarily limit access to testing.",Fred Turner; Amy VandenBerg; Vladimir I Slepnev; Suzana Car; Rita E Starritt; Michael V Seger; Noah Kojima; Nina Nirema; Lauren Lopez; Matthew Brobeck; Sarah K August; Alejandra Orosco; Fred Hertlein; Arthur M Baca,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250523,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250523,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
434,High infection attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 in Dutch households revealed by dense sampling,"BackgroundIndoor environments are considered a main setting for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Households in particular present a close-contact environment with high probability of transmission between persons of different ages and with different roles in society.

MethodsComplete households with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive case in the Netherlands (March-May 2020) were included. At least three home visits were performed during 4-6 week of follow-up, collecting naso- and oropharyngeal swabs, oral fluid, faeces and blood samples for molecular and serological analyses of all household members. Symptoms were recorded from two weeks before the first visit up to the last visit. Secondary attack rates (SAR) were estimated with logistic regression. A transmission model was used to assess transmission routes in the household.

ResultsA total of 55 households with 187 household contacts were included. In 17 households no transmission took place, and in 11 households all persons were infected. Estimated SARs were high, ranging from 35% (95%CI: 24%-46%) in children to 51% (95%CI: 39%-63%) in adults. Estimated transmission rates in the household were high, with reduced susceptibility of children compared to adolescents and adults (0.67; 95%CI: 0.40-1.1).

ConclusionEstimated SARs were higher than reported in earlier household studies, presumably owing to a dense sampling protocol. Children were shown to be less susceptible than adults, but the estimated SAR in children was still high. Our results reinforce the role of households as main multiplier of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population.

Key pointsWe analyze data from a SARS-CoV-2 household study and find higher secondary attack rates than reported earlier. We argue that this is due to a dense sampling strategy that includes sampling at multiple time points and of multiple anatomical sites.",Daphne F.M.

435,Adaptive immunity to human coronaviruses is widespread but low in magnitude,"Endemic human coronaviruses (hCoV) circulate worldwide but cause minimal mortality. Although seroconversion to hCoV is near ubiquitous during childhood, little is known about hCoV-specific T cell memory in adults. We quantified CD4 T cell and antibody responses to hCoV spike antigens in 42 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals. T cell responses were widespread within conventional memory and cTFH compartments but did not correlate with IgG titres. SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells were observed in 48% of participants and correlated with HKU1 memory. hCoV-specific T cells exhibited a CCR6+ central memory phenotype in the blood, but were enriched for frequency and CXCR3 expression in human lung draining lymph nodes. Overall, hCoV-specific humoral and cellular memory are independently maintained, with a shared phenotype existing among coronavirus-specific CD4 T cells. This understanding of endemic coronavirus immunity provides insight into the homeostatic maintenance of immune responses that are likely to be critical components of protection against SARS-CoV-2.",Hyon-Xhi Tan; Wen Shi Lee; Kathleen M Wragg; Christina Nelson; Robyn Esterbauer; Hannah G Kelly; Thakshila Amarasena; Robert M Jones; Graham Starkey; Bao Zhong Wang; Osamu Yoshino; Thomas Tiang; M Lindsay Grayson; Helen Opdam; Angela Vago; - The Austin Liver Transplant Perfusionist Group; Laura K Mackay; Claire L Gordon; Adam K Wheatley; Stephen J Kent; Jennifer A Juno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250074,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250074,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
436,Near real-time surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with incomplete data,"Designing public health responses to outbreaks requires close monitoring of population-level health indicators in real-time. Thus, an accurate estimation of the epidemic curve is critical. We propose an approach to reconstruct epidemic curves in near real time. We apply this approach to characterize the early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two Spanish regions between March and April 2020.

We address two data collection problems that affected the reliability of the available real-time epidemiological data, namely, the frequent missing information documenting when a patient first experienced symptoms, and the frequent retrospective revision of historical information (including right censoring). This is done by using a novel back-calculating procedure based on imputing patients dates of symptom onset from reported cases, according to a dynamically-estimated ""backward"" reporting delay conditional distribution, and adjusting for right censoring using an existing package, NobBS, to estimate in real time (nowcast) cases by date of symptom onset. This process allows us to obtain an approximation of the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) in real-time.

At each step, we evaluate how different assumptions affect the recovered epidemiological events and compare the proposed approach to the alternative procedure of merely using curves of case counts, by report day, to characterize the time-evolution of the outbreak. Finally, we assess how these real-time estimates compare with subsequently documented epidemiological information that is considered more reliable and complete that became available later in time. Our approach may help improve accuracy, quantify uncertainty, and evaluate frequently unstated assumptions when recovering the epidemic curves from limited data obtained from public health surveillance systems in other locations.",Pablo Martinez de Salazar; Fred Lu; James A Hay; Diana Gomez-Barroso; Pablo Fernandez-Navarro; Elena Vanessa Martinez; Jenaro Astray-Mochales; Rocio Amillategui; Ana Garcia-Fulgueiras; Maria Dolores Chirlaque; Alonso Sanchez-Migallon; Amparo Larrauri; Maria Jose Sierra; Marc Lipsitch; Fernando Simon; Mauricio Santillana; Miguel Hernan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.20230094,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.20230094,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
437,COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate as a marker for hospital overload,"The use of antigen tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in Italy has risen sharply in autumn 2020. Although, Italian regions like Alto Adige, Veneto, Toscana, Lazio, Piemonte and Marche did a large use of these tests for screening and surveillance purposes or for implementing diagnosis protocols, in addition to molecular tests, they were not reported in the statistics in the last months of 2020. As a consequence of this situation the test positivity rate (TPR) index, defined as the number of new positive cases divided by the number of tests, has lost in accuracy. Only in the recent days, starting from the 15th of January 2021, antigen tests have become part of the statistics for all the Italian regions. Despite the lack of data, we have noticed that TPR has a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospitals, and that TPR peaks in general precede the peaks of hospitalized people which occur on average about 15 days later.

In this paper, we have deepened this intuition, analysing the TPR course and its relationship with the number of hospitalized people. To conduct the study we have defined a novel version of the TPR index which takes into account the number of tests done with respect to the population (considering both molecular and antigen tests), the number of infected individuals, and the number of patients healed. Successively, starting from a limited set of data which were made available in November 2020, we have reconstructed the antigen tests time series of four Italian regions, and we computed the TPR index for them.

The results show that TPR peaks precede peaks of hospitalized people in both the first and the second phases of the pandemic in Italy, provided that antigen tests are considered. Moreover, the TPR index trend, can be used to deduct important information on the course of the epidemic, and on the impact of COVID-19 in the health care system, which can be monitored in advance.",Mauro Gaspari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21249544,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21249544,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
438,"Super-Spreaders Out, Super-Spreading In: The Effects of Infectiousness Heterogeneity and Lockdowns on Herd Immunity","Recently, [8] has proposed that heterogeneity of infectiousness (and susceptibility) across individuals in infectious diseases, plays a major role in affecting the Herd Immunity Thresh-old (HIT). Such heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 and is recognized as overdis-persion (or ""super-spreading""). The model of [8] suggests that super-spreaders contribute significantly to the effective reproduction factor, R, and that they are likely to get infected and immune early in the process. Consequently, under R0 {approx} 3 (attributed to COVID-19), the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) is as low as 5%, in contrast to 67% according to the traditional models [1, 2, 4, 10].

This work follows up on [8] and proposes that heterogeneity of infectiousness (susceptibility) has two ""faces"" whose mix affects dramatically the HIT: (1) Personal-Trait-, and (2) Event-Based-Infectiousness (Susceptibility). The former is a personal trait of specific individuals (super-spreaders) and is nullified once those individuals are immune (as in [8]). The latter is event-based (e.g cultural super-spreading events) and remains effective throughout the process, even after the super-spreaders immune. We extend [8]s model to account for these two factors, analyze it and conclude that the HIT is very sensitive to the mix between (1) and (2), and under R0 {approx} 3 it can vary between 5% and 67%. Preliminary data from COVID-19 suggests that herd immunity is not reached at 5%.

We address operational aspects and analyze the effects of lockdown strategies on the spread of a disease. We find that herd immunity (and HIT) is very sensitive to the lock-down type. While some lockdowns affect positively the disease blocking and increase herd immunity, others have adverse effects and reduce the herd immunity.",Jhonatan Tavori; Hanoch Levy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250242,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250242,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
439,ARE GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POORER OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19?,"BackgroundThe prognosis of patients with COVID-19, with older age and comorbidities, is associated with a more severe course and higher fatality rates but no analysis has yet included factors related to the geographical area/municipality in which the affected patients live. So the objective of this study is to analyse the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in terms of sex, age, comorbidities, and geographic variables.

MethodsA retrospective cohort of 6286 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was analysed, considering demographic data, previous comorbidities and geographic variables. The main study variables were hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and death due to worsening symptoms; and the secondary variables were sex, age, comorbidities and geographic variables (size of the area of residence, distance to the hospital and the driving time to the hospital). A comparison analysis and a multivariate Cox model were performed.

ResultsThe multivariate Cox model showed that women had a better prognosis in any type of analysed prognosis. Most of the comorbidities studied were related to a poorer prognosis except for dementia, which is related to lower admissions and higher mortality. Suburban areas were associated with greater mortality and with less hospital or ICU admission. Distance to the hospital was also associated with hospital admission.

440,A cross-sectional survey of the workplace factors contributing to symptoms of anxiety and depression among nurses and physicians during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in two US healthcare systems,"BackgroundAnxiety and depression among physicians and nurses during COVID-19 pandemic in the USA is not well described and its modifiable causes poorly understood.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) among physicians and nurses in two US healthcare systems June-Sept 2020. We ascertained features of work as well as its perceptions and associated concerns in relation to risk of anxiety and depression, while controlling for health history via regression and path analyses.

ResultsAbout a third of 684 nurses and 185 physicians surveyed showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, the excess was particularly prominent in nurses. Belief in having been infected was a dominant cause of anxiety and depression, more related to history of symptoms of pneumonia, then the contact with infected patients. Having confidence in competent use and access to personal protective equipment, maintaining usual working hours and being surrounded by colleagues who were both sufficient in numbers and not stressed, was protective. Having support of immediate family and religious communities lessened anxiety and depression after accounting for other factors. Involvement in aerosol-generating procedures with infected patients was linked with lower depression in nurses but higher among physicians. Likewise, the setting of recent patient encounters affected risk differently for physicians and nurses.

441,SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with robust inflammatory response at the maternal-fetal interface,"Pregnant women appear to be at increased risk for severe outcomes associated with COVID-19, but the pathophysiology underlying this increased morbidity and its potential impact on the developing fetus is not well understood. In this study of pregnant women with and without COVID-19, we assessed viral and immune dynamics at the placenta during maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Amongst uninfected women, ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the normal placenta during early pregnancy but was rarely seen in healthy placentas at full term. Term placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2, however, displayed a significant increase in ACE2 levels. Using immortalized cell lines and primary isolated placental cells, we determined the vulnerability of various placental cell types to direct infection by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Yet, despite the susceptibility of placental cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral RNA was detected in the placentas of only a subset ([~]13%) of women in this cohort. Through single cell transcriptomic analyses, we found that the maternal-fetal interface of SARS-CoV-2-infected women exhibited markers associated with pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, and robust immune responses, including increased activation of placental NK and T cells and increased expression of interferon-related genes. Overall, this study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of detectable local viral invasion. While this likely represents a protective mechanism shielding the placenta from infection, inflammatory changes in the placenta may also contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes and thus warrant further investigation.",Alice Lu-Culligan; Arun R.

442,Covid-19 in end-stage renal disease patients with renal replacement therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, showed various prevalence and case-fatality rates (CFR) among patients with different pre-existing chronic conditions. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) might have a higher prevalence and CFR due to reduced immune function from uremia and kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, but there was no systematic study on the infection and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in ESRD patients who are on RRT.

MethodsWe searched five electronic databases and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis up to June 30, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19 infection among ESRD patients with RRT. The global COVID-19 data were retrieved from the international database on June 30, 2020, for estimating the prevalence and CFR of the general population as referencing points.

ResultsOf 3,272 potential studies, 34 were eligible studies consisted of 1,944 COVID-19 confirmed cases in 21,873 ESRD patients with RRT from 12 countries in four WHO regions. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with RRT was 3.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-5.72] which was higher than referencing 0.14% global average prevalence. The overall estimated CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was 18.06% (95%CI 14.09- 22.32) which was higher than the global average at 4.98%.

ConclusionsThis meta-analysis suggested high COVID-19 prevalence and CFR in ESRD patients with RRT. ESRD patients with RRT should have their specific protocol of COVID-19 prevention and treatment to mitigate excess cases and deaths.

Author summaryChronic kidney disease (CKD) was associated with increasing severity and mortality of COVID-19. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients were at the terminal stage of CKD and had reduced immune function due to uremia. Additionally, ESRD patients with kidney transplantation had a diminished immune system from immunosuppressive agents. Kidneys might be the secondary target of SARS-CoV-2 after the respiratory tract regardless of the previous history of kidney disease, preferably the glomerulus, which was associated with the richness of some specific protein-coding genes in the kidney. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy was approximately 22 times of the referencing global average prevalence. The overall estimated case fatality rate of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy was approximately 3.6 times the global average. ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy had high COVID-19 prevalence and case fatality rate. We suggested that ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy should have their specific protocol of COVID-19 prevention and treatment to mitigate excess cases and deaths.",Tanawin Nopsopon; Jathurong Kittrakulrat; Kullaya Takkavatakarn; Thanee Eiamsitrakoon; Talerngsak Kanjanabuch; Krit Pongpirul,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250454,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
443,Logistic advantage of two-step screening strategy for SARS-CoV-2 at airport quarantine,"BackgroundAirport quarantine is required to reduce the risk of entry of travelers infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, it is challenging for both high accuracy and rapid turn-around time to coexist in testing; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is time-consuming with high accuracy, while antigen testing is rapid with less accuracy.

Methods88,924 (93.2%) of 95,457 arrivals at three international airports in Japan were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using self-collected saliva by a screening strategy with initial chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) followed by confirmatory nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) only for intermediate range antigen concentrations.

Results254 (0.27%) persons were found to be SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive ([&ge;] 4.0 pg/mL) by CLEIA. NAAT was required for confirmatory testing in 513 (0.54%) persons with intermediate antigen concentrations (0.67-4.0 pg/mL) whereby the virus was detected in 34 (6.6%) persons. This two-step strategy dramatically reduced the utilization of NAAT to approximately one out of every 200 test subjects.

Estimated performance of this strategy did not show significant increase in false negatives as compared to performing NAAT in all subjects. Further reduction in imported cases may be achieved by post-screening quarantine.

ConclusionsPoint of care testing by quantitative CLEIA using self-collected saliva is less labor-intensive and yields results rapidly, thus suitable as an initial screening test.

444,Emergence and fast spread of B.1.1.7 lineage in Lebanon.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a rapid spread emerging disease. Recently, a new variant of this virus called SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (or B.1.1.7 lineage), described in the United Kingdom (UK), has become highly prevalent in several countries. Its rate of transmission has been estimated to be greatly higher. B.1.1.7 lineage harbors 23 mutations co-existed for the first time in the same variant. Herein, we are interested only by the deletion mutation {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 in the spike protein.

In the UK they were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the increase in the false negative result for the spike target of a three-target RT-PCR assay from Thermo Fisher Scientific (TaqPath kit). Later, the manufacturer announced that this false negative result is because of the deletion {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 in the area targeted by the TaqPath Kit. Furthermore, The European CDC recommended that the use of this kit help to track the new variant.

Genome sequencing is the gold method to confirm the new variant, but observational studies provide also stronger evidence if similar models are observed in multiple countries, especially when randomized studies are not possible. In Lebanon, the highest number of confirmed cases were reported in first week of 2021. In the present study, we show the emergence and the fast spreading of the new variant in Lebanon and a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 transmission intensity and the frequency of the new variant during the first twelve days of January.",mahmoud younes; kassem hamze; hassan nassar; mohammad makki; Mayssa Ghaddar; paul Nguewa; fadi abdel sater,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21249974,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21249974,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
445,Estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate in Germany,"Assessing the infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most controversial issues during the pandemic. Due to asymptomatic or mild courses of COVID-19, many infections remain undetected. Reported case fatality rates - COVID-19-associated deaths divided by number of detected infections - are therefore poor estimates of the IFR. Endogenous changes of the population at risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, changing test practices and an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 further exacerbate the estimation of the IFR. Here, we propose a strategy to estimate the IFR of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany that combines official data on reported cases and fatalities supplied by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) with data from seroepidemiological studies in two infection hotspots, the Austrian town Ischgl and the German municipality Gangelt, respectively. For this purpose, we use the law of total probability to derive an approximate formula for the IFR that is based on a set of assumptions regarding data quality and test specificity and sensitivity. The resulting estimate of the IFR in Germany of 0.83% (95% CI: [0.69%; 0.98%]) that is based on a combination of the RKI and Ischgl data is notably higher than the IFR estimate reported in the Gangelt study (0.36% [0.29%; 0.45%]). It is closer to the consolidated estimate based on a meta-analysis (0.68% [0.53%; 0.82%]), where the difference can be explained by Germanys disadvantageous age structure. As a result of virus mutations, vaccination strategies, and improved therapy, a re-estimation of the IFR will eventually be mandated; the proposed method is able to account for such developments.",Thomas Dimpfl; Jantje Sönksen; Ingo Bechmann; Joachim Grammig,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250507,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250507,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
446,Community structured model for vaccine strategies to control COVID19 spread: a mathematical study,"Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",Elena Aruffo; Pei Yuan; Yi Tan; Evgenia Gatov; Effie Gournis; Sarah Collier; Nick Ogden; Jacques B&eacutelair; Huaiping Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250505,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250505,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
447,"Health impact of routine immunisation service disruptions and mass vaccination campaign suspensions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: Multimodel comparative analysis of disruption scenarios for measles, meningococcal A, and yellow fever vaccination in 10 low- and lower middle-income countries","BackgroundChildhood immunisation services have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO recommends considering outbreak risk using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether to conduct preventive vaccination campaigns during the pandemic.

MethodsWe used 2-3 models per infection to estimate the health impact of 50% reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 and delay of campaign vaccination from 2020 to 2021 for measles vaccination in Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan, for meningococcal A vaccination in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, and for yellow fever vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Our counterfactual comparative scenario was sustaining immunisation services at coverage projections made prior to COVID-19 (i.e. without any disruption).

FindingsReduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 without catch-up vaccination may lead to an increase in measles and yellow fever disease burden in the modelled countries. Delaying planned campaigns in Ethiopia and Nigeria by a year may significantly increased the risk of measles outbreaks (both countries did complete their SIAS planned for 2020). For yellow fever vaccination, delay in campaigns leads to a potential disease burden rise of >1 death per 100,000 people until the campaigns are implemented. For meningococcal A vaccination, short term disruptions in 2020 are unlikely to have a significant impact due to the persistence of direct and indirect benefits from past introductory campaigns of the 1 to 29-year-old population, bolstered by inclusion of the vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule accompanied by further catch-up campaigns.

InterpretationThe impact of COVID-19-related disruption to vaccination programs varies between infections and countries. Planning and implementation of campaigns should consider country and infection-specific epidemiological factors and local immunity gaps worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic when prioritising vaccines and strategies for catch-up vaccination.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (child health intervention OR vaccin* or immuni*) AND (disruption OR suspension OR reduction) AND (indirect effect OR health impact) on January 14, 2021, with no language restrictions. We found 178 articles of which 13 articles were relevant. Six articles reported some empirical data on immunization disruption in Bangladesh, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain and Italy, and a survey study focussed on immunization disruption in low and middle-income countries. One article proposed using the WHO health systems framework to assess the effects of COVID-19 on immunisation programmes in South Africa, another study on leveraging systems thinking and implementation science to improve immunization system performance in Africa, and two studies were review articles. One modelling study focused on the indirect effects, including reduction in routine immunisation services, of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. Another modelling study focused on a benefit-risk analysis of routine childhood immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. We also found one other study in the grey literature that analysed the impact on SARS-CoV-2 infections as a result of fixed-post and door-to-door vaccination campaigns targeted at children under five years of age in an Ethiopia-like setting.

Added value of this studyWe estimated the increase in cases and deaths caused by the disruption to immunisation services leading to outbreaks for measles, meningococcal A and yellow fever in 10 countries. The reduction in routine immunisation coverage among under-immunised cohorts of children has enhanced the risk of outbreaks which cannot be averted without catch-up vaccination. This can lead to an increase of 9.89% (0.91 additional deaths per 100,000 individuals, or 48,000 in total) across the three diseases from 2020 to 2030 in the countries considered. Results vary by infection and country, but generally most excess deaths are due to measles. Postponing campaign immunisation may not have a detrimental short-term health impact if campaign immunisation is implemented ahead of future outbreaks caused by these immunity gaps.

Implications of the available evidenceThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to routine services and vaccination campaigns and resulted in immunity gaps with potential to cause outbreaks in the affected populations. The short-term and long-term health impact differ between measles, meningococcal A and yellow fever vaccination and by countries based on the local epidemiological situation. Thereby, catch-up vaccination should be planned by considering the heterogeneity in population susceptibility across different countries to measles, meningococcal A and yellow fever outbreaks and implemented in time to prevent these outbreaks. The study findings can inform risk-benefit trade-off discussions around the timing of campaigns.",Katy Gaythorpe; Kaja Abbas; John Huber; Andromachi Karachaliou; Niket Thakkar; Kim Woodruff; Xiang Li; Susy Echeverria-Londono; - VIMC Working Group on COVID-19 Impact on Vaccine Preventable Disease; Matthew Ferrari; Michael L Jackson; Kevin McCarthy; Alex Perkins; Caroline Trotter; Mark Jit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250489,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250489,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
448,Impact of social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity levels of older adults: an analysis of the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study,"ObjectivesPhysical inactivity is more common in older adults, is associated with social isolation and loneliness, and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. We examined the effect of social restrictions, implemented to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in the UK (lockdown), on physical activity (PA) levels of older adults, and the demographic, lifestyle and social predictors of this change.

DesignBaseline analysis of a survey-based prospective cohort study

SettingAdults enrolled in the Cognitive Health in Ageing Register for Investigational and Observational Trials (CHARIOT) cohort from GP practices in North West London were invited to participate from April to July 2020.

Participants6,219 cognitively healthy adults aged 50 to 92 years completed the survey.

Main outcome measuresSelf-reported PA before and after lockdown, as measured by Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) minutes. Associations of PA with demographic, lifestyle and social factors, mood and frailty.

ResultsMean PA was significantly lower following lockdown, from 3,519 MET minutes/week to 3,185 MET minutes/week (p<0.001). After adjustment for confounders and pre-lockdown PA, lower levels of PA after lockdown were found in those who were over 85 years old (640 [95% CI: 246 to 1034] MET minutes/week less); were divorced or single (240 [95% CI: 120 to 360] MET minutes/week less); living alone (277 [95% CI: 152 to 402] MET minutes/week less); reported feeling lonely often (306 [95% CI: 60 to 552] MET minutes/week less); and showed symptoms of depression (1007 [95% CI: 1401 to 612] MET minutes/week less) compared to those aged 50-64 years, married, co-habiting, and not reporting loneliness or depression, respectively.

449,"Elevated HScore is Associated with Poor Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19, Even in the Absence of Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis.","IntroductionPatients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently experience a hyperinflammatory syndrome, that leads to unfavorable outcomes. This condition resembles Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) described in neoplastic, rheumatic and other infectious diseases. However, it has not been prospectively studied on these patients. A scoring system (HScore) has been validated for sHLH, and recently proposed to evaluate hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

Methods143 patients aged [&ge;]18 years admitted because of COVID-19 were enrolled in a prospective, single-center, cohort study. HScore was calculated within the 72 hours since admission. The incidence of sHLH during hospitalization was evaluated. Additionally, the relationship between HScore [&ge;]130 points and either the requirement of mechanical ventilation or 60-days mortality was explored.

ResultsThe median age of enrolled patients was 57 (21-100), and 63.6% were male. The median HScore was 96 (33-169). One patient was diagnosed with sHLH (incidence 0,7%), due to a HScore of 169. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and obesity, HScore [&ge;]130 was independently associated with the composite clinical outcome (HR 2.13, p=0.022).

450,Home-based management of COVID-19 by identification of low-risk features,"BackgroundCovid-19 is a triphasic disorder characterized by a viral phase lasting 7-10 days from onset of symptoms. In approximately 20% it is followed by a second stage heralded by elevation of pro- inflammatory markers such as ferritin, IL-6, CRP, LDH and D-dimers. We hypothesized that those with few abnormalities would have a low risk for progression to respiratory insufficiency and hence could be monitored at home without treatment.

MethodsInclusion criteria included Covid infection, age >21, Oxygen saturation >90%. To be observed without treatment, patients could have no more than 1 of the following: CRP > 10 mg/dL, high LDH, ferritin > 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L, IL-6 > 10 pg/ml, absolute lymphocyte count <1,000, Oxygen saturation <94%, or CT chest evidence of pneumonia. Primary endpoint was progression to respiratory failure and secondary endpoints was 28-day survival.

ResultsOf 208 entered, 132 were low-risk and hence were monitored without therapy. None progressed to respiratory failure or died.

ConclusionsWe have shown that our approach can identify cases who can safely be observed without treatment, thus avoiding expensive, potentially toxic therapies, and circumventing unnecessary, costly hospitalizations. These results support our hypothesis that applying our criteria, 64% of Covid-19 cases can be monitored as outpatients without therapy.

What is already known about this subjectO_LICOVID-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by an infectious or viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until 7-10 days later. This is followed by a second phase considered as the inflammatory stage, characterized initially by the appearance of lung infiltrates which is followed in some cases by hypoxemia.
C_LIO_LIApproximately 80% of patients never proceed to the second phase but currently there is no reliable and objective method to accurately predict those that are cured spontaneously without any treatment and who could be managed at home.

What this study addsO_LIWe have developed an approach, based essentially on blood-based inflammatory markers which identifies low-risk cases that do not require therapy and can be managed at home. This method showed an excellent correlation with clinical outcome and has encouraging financial and psychological effects.
C_LIO_LIOf 208 patients, 132, fulfilled criteria for low-risk disease that justified monitoring at home without therapy and none of these developed respiratory failure or any other significant complication.
C_LIO_LIIncluded in this low-risk group were many cases with comorbidities, with COVID-19 pneumonia, as well as patients older than 65 and with more than two symptoms at presentation.

451,Colder and drier winter conditions are associated with greater SARS-CoV-2 transmission: a regional study of the first epidemic wave in north-west hemisphere countries.,"Higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in cold and dry weather conditions has been hypothesized since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic but the level of epidemiological evidence remains low.

During the first wave of the pandemic, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Canada and USA presented an early spread, a heavy COVID-19 burden, and low initial public health response until lockdowns. In a context when testing was limited, we calculated the basic reproduction number (R0) in 63 regions from the growth in regional death counts. After adjusting for population density, early spread of the epidemic, and age structure, temperature and humidity were negatively associated to SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. A reduction of mean absolute humidity by 1g/m3 was associated with a 0.15-unit increase of R0. Below 10{degrees}C, a temperature reduction of 1{degrees}C was associated with a 0.16-unit increase of R0.

Our results confirm a dependency of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility to weather conditions in the absence of control measures during the first wave. The transition from summer-to winter-like conditions likely contributed to the intensification of the second wave in north-west hemisphere countries.

455,Increased Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 to Antibody Neutralization,"The Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the globe, and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, continues to rage. Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Single and combination monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization1,2, with more in the pipeline3-6. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise7, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-198,9. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since, including variants with a D614G mutation10 that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct, however11. Recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK12 and B.1.351 in South Africa13 is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma (~3 fold) and vaccinee sera (~2 fold). Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple individual mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, largely due to an E484K mutation, although some mAb combinations retain activity. Moreover, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (~11-33 fold) and vaccinee sera (~6.5-8.6 fold).

458,Computational Investigation of Increased Virulence and Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7,"New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being reported worldwide. More specifically, the variants reported in South Africa (501Y.V2) and United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) were found to be more contagious than the wild type. There are also speculations that the variants might evade the host immune responses induced by currently available vaccines and develop resistance to drugs under consideration. The first step of viral infection in COVID-19, occurs through the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with peptidase domain of the human ACE-2 (hACE-2) receptor. So, possibly the mutations in the RBD domain of spike protein in the new variants could modulate the protein-protein interaction with hACE-2 receptor leading to the increased virulence. In this study, we aim to get molecular level understanding into the mechanism behind the increased infection rate due to such mutations in these variants. We have computationally studied the interaction of the spike protein in both wild-type and B.1.1.7 variant with hACE-2 receptor using combined molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations using molecular mechanics-Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach. The binding free energies computed using configurations from minimization run and low temperature simulation show that mutant variant of spike protein has increased binding affinity for hACE-2 receptor (i.e. {Delta}{Delta}G(N501Y,A570D) is in the range -20.4 to -21.4 kcal/mol)The residue-wise decomposition analysis and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis evidenced that the N501Y mutation has increased interaction between RBD of spike protein with ACE-2 receptor. We have also carried out calculations using density functional theory and the results evidenced the increased interaction between three pairs of residues (TYR449 (spike)-ASP38 (ACE-2), TYR453-HIE34 and TYR501-LYS353) in the variant that could be attributed to its increased virulence. The free energies of wild-type and mutant variants of the spike protein computed from MM-GBSA approach suggests that latter variant is stable by about -10.4 kcal/mol when compared to wild type suggesting that it will be retained in the evolution due to increased stability. We demonstrate that with the use of the state-of-the art of computational approaches, we can in advance predict the more virulent nature of variants of SARS-CoV-2 and alert the world health-care system.",Murugan Arul Natarajan; Prashanth S.

459,Kinetics and correlates of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,"A detailed understanding of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 immunity has critical implications for overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and for informing on vaccination strategies. In this study, we evaluated the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in a cohort of 963 recovered individuals over a period of 10 months. Investigating a total of 2,146 samples, we detected an initial SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 94.4% of individuals, with 82% and 79% exhibiting serum and IgG neutralization, respectively. Approximately 3% of recovered patients demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity, defining them as  elite neutralizers. These individuals also possessed effective cross-neutralizing IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 without any known prior exposure to this virus. By applying multivariate statistical modeling, we found that sero-reactivity, age, time since disease onset, and fever are key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in mild courses of COVID-19. Investigating longevity of the antibody response, we detected loss of anti-spike reactivity in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Moreover, neutralizing activity had an initial half-life of 6.7 weeks in serum versus 30.8 weeks in purified IgG samples indicating the presence of a more stable and long-term memory IgG B cell repertoire in the majority of individuals recovered from COVID-19. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum of the initial SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response depending on clinical characteristics, with antibodies being maintained in the majority of individuals for the first 10 months after mild course of COVID-19.",Kanika Vanshylla; Veronica Di Cristianziano; Franziska Kleipass; Felix Dewald; Philipp Schommers; Lutz Gieselmann; Henning Gruell; Maike Schlotz; Meryem S Ercanoglu; Ricarda Stumpf; Petra Mayer; Eva Heger; Wibke Johannis; Carola Horn; Isabelle Suarez; Norma Jung; Susanne Salomon; Kirsten Eberhardt; Gerd Faetkenheuer; Nico Pfeifer; Ralf Eggeling; Max Augustin; Clara Lehmann; Florian Klein,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.428207,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.428207,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,False
460,40 minutes RT-qPCR Assay for Screening Spike N501Y and HV69-70del Mutations,"A one-step reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) test was developed for rapid screening (40 minutes) of the Spike N501Y and HV69-70del mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The test also targets a conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab as an internal control. The samples containing both the N501Y and HV69-70del mutations are concluded as VOC-202012/01 positive. Samples suspected to be positive for B.1.351 or P.1 are the N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative cases. Limit of detection (LOD) of the kit for Orf1ab target is 500 copies/mL, while that of the N501, Y501 and HV69-70del targets are 5000 copies/mL. The developed assay was applied to 165 clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2 from 32 different lineages. The SARS-CoV-2 lineages were determined via the next-generation sequencing (NGS). The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the NGS results that 19 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del positive, 10 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 1 sample was N501Y negative and HV69-70del positive, and 135 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. All the VOC-202012/01 positive samples were detected in people who have traveled from England to Turkey. The RT-qPCR test and the Sanger sequencing was further applied to 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples collected in Jan2021 from the 81 different provinces of Turkey. The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the Sanger sequencing results that 32 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 4 samples were N501Y negative and HV69-70del positive, 964 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. The specificity of the 40 minutes RT-qPCR assay relative to the sequencing-based technologies is 100%. The developed assay is an advantageous tool for timely and representative estimation of the N501Y positive variants prevalence because it allows testing a much higher portion of the SARS-CoV-2 positives in much lower time compared to the sequencing-based technologies.",Gulay Korukluoglu; Mustafa Kolukirik; Fatma Bayrakdar; Gozde Girgin Ozgumus; Ayse Basak Altas; Yasemin Cosgun; Canan Zohre Ketre Kolukirik,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.428302,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.428302,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,False
461,Variability in codon usage in Coronaviruses is mainly driven by mutational bias and selective constraints on CpG dinucleotide,"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus within the Orthocoronavirinae causing an emergent infectious disease in humans, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19). Due to the high zoonotic potential of these viruses, it is critical to unravel their evolutionary history of host species shift, adaptation and emergence. Only such knowledge can guide virus discovery, surveillance and research efforts to identify viruses posing a pandemic risk in humans. We present a comprehensive analysis of the composition and codon usage bias of the 82 Orthocoronavirinae members, infecting 47 different avian and mammalian hosts. Our results clearly establish that synonymous codon usage varies widely among viruses and is only weakly dependent on the type of host they infect. Instead, we identify mutational bias towards AT-enrichment and selection against CpG dinucleotides as the main factors responsible of the codon usage bias variation. Further insight on the mutational equilibrium within Orthocoronavirinae revealed that most coronavirus genomes are close to their neutral equilibrium, the exception is the three recently-infecting human coronaviruses, which lie further away from the mutational equilibrium than their endemic human coronavirus counterparts. Finally, our results suggest that while replicating in humans SARS-CoV-2 is slowly becoming AT-richer, likely until attaining a new mutational equilibrium.",Josquin Daron; Ignacio G.

Back to Roots was a collaborative, community-based pilot intervention project in the British Asian community. To assess the efficacy and safety of Ayurveda intervention in relieving symptoms of mild-to-moderate COVID-19, a community based participatory research framework was used. Prospectively 28 patients were enrolled with confirmed COVID-19 clinical stages of mild-to-moderate COVID-19, symptomatic, and between 20 to 70{square}years of age. Routine management was followed by all patients managing at home, additionally patents taking Ayurveda intervention for 14 consecutive days. The efficacy and safety of Ayurveda intervention were evaluated. There were suggestions of Ayurvedas advantage in improved symptoms relief, clinical recovery in 7 days. However, a control group was not included but data triangulations from separate usual care found the difference statistically significant. Ayurveda intervention may potentially have a beneficial effect on patients with COVID{square}19, especially for those with mild to moderate symptoms.

463,Escape of SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variants from neutralization by convalescent plasma,"New SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike glycoprotein have arisen independently at multiple locations and may have functional significance. The combination of mutations in the 501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa include the N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we address whether the 501Y.V2 variant could escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by natural infection with earlier variants. We were the first to outgrow two variants of 501Y.V2 from South Africa, designated 501Y.V2.HV001 and 501Y.V2.HVdF002. We examined the neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma collected from six adults hospitalized with COVID-19 using a microneutralization assay with live (authentic) virus. Whole genome sequencing of the infecting virus of the plasma donors confirmed the absence of the spike mutations which characterize 501Y.V2. We infected with 501Y.V2.HV001 and 501Y.V2.HVdF002 and compared plasma neutralization to first wave virus which contained the D614G mutation but no RBD or NTD mutations. We observed that neutralization of the 501Y.V2 variants was strongly attenuated, with IC50 6 to 200-fold higher relative to first wave virus. The degree of attenuation varied between participants and included a knockout of neutralization activity. This observation indicates that 501Y.V2 may escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by prior natural infection. It raises a concern of potential reduced protection against re-infection and by vaccines designed to target the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Sandile Cele; Inbal Gazy; Laurelle Jackson; Shi-Hsia Hwa; Houriiyah Tegally; Gila Lustig; Jennifer Giandhari; Sureshnee Pillay; Eduan Wilkinson; Yeshnee Naidoo; Farina Karim; Yashica Ganga; Khadija Khan; Alejandro B.

464,SARS-CoV-2 Airborne Surveillance Using Non-Powered Cold Traps,"BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide challenge requiring efficient containment strategies. High-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing and legal restrictions are not effective in order to get the current outbreak under control. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with a higher transmissibility require efficient strategies for early detection and surveillance.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in aerosols collected by non-powered cold traps. SARS-CoV-2 spreading kinetics and indoor hotspots could be identified in isolation units and at public places within a high-endemic area. These included an outpatient endoscopy facility, a concert hall, and a shopping mall.

ResultsIndoor COVID-19 hotspots were found in non-ventilated areas and in zones that are predisposed to a buoyancy (chimney) effect. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those aerosols reached concentrations of 105 copies/mL. Extensive outdoor air ventilation reliably eliminates SARS-CoV-2 aerosol contamination.

ConclusionsThe method presented herein could predict SARS-CoV-2 indoor hotspots and may help to characterize SARS-CoV-2 spreading kinetics. Moreover, it can be used for the surveillance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Due to low costs and easy handling, the procedure might enable efficient algorithms for COVID-19 prevention and screening.",Sven G.

465,High density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisation: the UK Biobank study,"IntroductionWhile unfavourable changes in High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol appear to be a consequence of COVID-19, the reverse has been little-studied. Our objective was to test whether HDL-cholesterol within the normal range is associated with subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisation.

DesignWe examined 317,306 participants in the prospective UK Biobank study with complete data on HDL-cholesterol and covariates at baseline (2006-2010). Follow-up for COVID-19 status was via hospitalisation records in England (16th March and 31st May 2020). Death certificates for the period 1st March to 30th September 2020 with an underlying cause denoted as COVID-19 (emergency ICD-10 code U07.1) were also utilised.

ResultsLower COVID-19 hospitalisation risk was apparent in people with higher level of HDL-cholesterol, adjusting for factors including health behaviours, inflammatory markers, and socio-economic status. The association appeared to be linear so that for each 0.2 mmol/L increase in HDL-cholesterol, the odds ratio for COVID-19 hospitalisation was 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.86, 0.96). A similar pattern of association was apparent when deaths from COVID-19 was the outcome of interest.

466,Contact patterns before and during the UK's Autumn 2020 COVID-19 lockdown among university students and staff,"IntroductionUK universities re-opened in September 2020, despite the on-going coronavirus epidemic. During the first term, various national social distancing measures were introduced, including banning groups of >6 people and the second lockdown in November. COVID-19 can spread rapidly in university-settings, and students adherence to social distancing measures is critical for controlling transmission.

MethodsWe measured university staff and student contact patterns via an online, longitudinal survey capturing self-reported contacts on the previous day. We investigated the change in contacts associated with COVID-19 guidance periods: post-first lockdown (23/06/2020-03/07/2020), relaxed guidance period (04/07/2020-13/09/2020), ""rule-of-six"" period (14/09/2020-04/11/2020), and the second lockdown (05/11/2020-25/11/2020).

Results722 staff (4199 responses) (mean household size: 2.6) and 738 students (1906 responses) (mean household size: 4.5) were included in the study. Contact number decreased with age. Staff in single-person households reported fewer contacts than individuals in 2-and 3-person households, and individuals in 4-and 5-person households reported more contacts.

For staff, daily contacts were higher in the relaxed guidance and ""rule-of-six"" periods (means: 3.2 and 3.5, respectively; medians: 3) than the post-first lockdown and second lockdown periods (means: 4.5 and 5.4, respectively; medians: 2). Few students responded until 05/10/2020, after which the median student contacts was 2 and the mean was 5.7, until the second lockdown when it dropped to 3.1.

467,"Integrating Operant and Cognitive Behavioral Economics to Inform Infectious Disease Response: Prevention, Testing, and Vaccination in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The role of human behavior to thwart transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 is evident. Yet, many areas of psychological and behavioral science are limited in the ability to mobilize to address exponential spread or provide easily translatable findings for policymakers. Here we describe how integrating methods from operant and cognitive approaches to behavioral economics can provide robust policy relevant data. Adapting well validated methods from behavioral economic discounting and demand frameworks, we evaluate in four crowdsourced samples (total N = 1,366) behavioral mechanisms underlying engagement in preventive health behaviors. We find that people are more likely to social distance when specified activities are framed as high risk, that describing delay until testing (rather than delay until results) increases testing likelihood, and that framing vaccine safety in a positive valence improves vaccine acceptance.

MethodsIn this single-center, retrospective, observational study, we calculated multiple rehabilitation indices of patients discharged from our rehabilitation ward between February 28 and May 25, 2020 when Hokkaido was initially affected by COVID-19, and compared them with those calculated during the same period in 2019. Fishers exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. We also verified the impact of implementing the original infection control measures for the rehabilitation team on preventing nosocomial infections.

ResultsA total of 93 patients (47 of 2020 group, 46 of 2019 group) were included. The median age was 87 and 88 years, respectively, with no differences in age, sex, and main disease between the groups. Training time per day in the ward in 2020 was significantly lower than that in 2019 (p = 0.013). No significant differences were found in the qualitative evaluation indices of Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score at admission, FIM gain, length of ward stay, FIM efficiency, and rate of discharge to home. None of the patients or staff members had confirmed COVID-19 during the study period.

469,"Pervasive transmission of E484K and emergence of VUI-NP13L with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection events by two different lineages in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages are under the spotlight of the media, scientific community and governments. Recent reports of novel variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil (B.1.1.28-E484K) have raised intense interest because of a possible higher transmission rate or resistance to the novel vaccines. Nevertheless, the spread of B.1.1.28 (E484K) and other variants in Brazil is still unknown. In this work, we investigated the population structure and genomic complexity of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil. Most samples sequenced belonged to the B.1.1.28 (E484K) lineage, demonstrating its widespread dispersion. We were the first to identify two independent events of co-infection caused by the occurrence of B.1.1.28 (E484K) with either B.1.1.248 or B.1.91 lineages. Also, clustering analysis revealed the occurrence of a novel cluster of samples circulating in the state (named VUI-NP13L) characterized by 12 lineage-defining mutations. In light of the evidence for E484K dispersion, co-infection and emergence of VUI-NP13L in Rio Grande do Sul, we reaffirm the importance of establishing strict and effective social distancing measures to counter the spread of potentially more hazardous SARS-CoV-2 strains.

HighlightsO_LIThe novel variant B.1.1.28 (E484K) previously described in Rio de Janeiro is currently spread across the southernmost state of Brazil;
C_LIO_LIThe novel variant VUI-NP13L was also identified by causing a local outbreak in Rio Grande do Sul;
C_LIO_LIB.1.1.28 (E484K) is able to establish successful coinfection events co-occurring simultaneously with different lineages of SARS-CoV-2.

470,mRNA-1273 vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies against spike mutants from global SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative infection of a global pandemic that has led to more than 2 million deaths worldwide. The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine has demonstrated ~94% efficacy in a Phase 3 study and has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100g of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of ~ 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with a ~ 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays. Despite the observed decreases, the GMT of VSV PsVN titers in human vaccinee sera against the B.1.351 variant remained at ~1/300. Taken together these data demonstrate reduced but still significant neutralization against the full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427948,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427948,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
471,An effect of the COVID-19 pandemic: significantly more complicated appendicitis due to delayed presentation of patients!,"AIMS OF THE STUDYThe novel coronavirus pandemic has affected emergency department consultations for surgical pathologies. The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODSWe retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multi-center database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre- and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated.

RESULTSA total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixty-five patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017-2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms (symptoms > 48h in 61% and 26%, p < 0,001), the intervention time (77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay (hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment (antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001).

CONCLUSIONSThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset. Patients and general practitioners should be aware of this problem to avoid a time delay from initial symptoms to consultation.",Marie Burgard; Floryn Cherbanyk; Konstantinos Nassiopoulos; Sonaz Malekzadeh; Francois Pugin; Bernhard Egger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250358,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250358,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
472,Mask adherence and rate of COVID-19 across the United States,"Mask wearing has been advocated by public health officials as a way to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more government leaders encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask-wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask-wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for AprilSeptember 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (MayOctober 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) >200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask-wearing policy for the general public reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19. This association between high mask adherence and reduced COVID-19 rates should influence policy makers and public health officials to focus on ways to improve mask adherence across the population in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.",Charlie B Fischer; Nedghie Adrien; Jeremiah J Silguero; Julianne J Hopper; Abir I Chowdhury; Martha M Werler,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250029,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250029,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
473,"Association between clinical characteristics and laboratory findings with outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a report from northeast of Iran","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in December 2019 in China and has rapidly spread worldwide. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and their association with the outcome of patients with COVID-19 can be decisive in management and early diagnosis. Data were obtained retrospectively from medical records of 397 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between February and May 2020 in Imam Reza hospital, northeast of Iran. Clinical and laboratory features were evaluated among survivors and non-survivors. The correlation between variables and duration of hospitalization and admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was determined. Male sex, age, hospitalization duration, and admission to ICU were significantly related to mortality rate. Headache was a more common feature in patients who survived (p = 0.017). It was also related to a shorter stay in the hospital (p = 0.032) as opposed to patients who experienced chest pain (p = 0.033). Decreased levels of consciousness and dyspnea were statistically more frequent in non-survivors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.011, respectively). Baseline white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in non-survivors (p < 0.001). Patients with higher WBC and CRP levels were more likely to be admitted to ICU (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). Evaluating clinical and laboratory features can help clinicians find ways for risk stratifying patients and even make predictive tools. Chest pain, decreased level of consciousness, dyspnea, and increased CRP and WBC levels seem to be the most potent predictors of severe prognosis.",Sahar Sobhani; Reihaneh Aryan; Elham Kalantari; Salman Soltani; Nafise Malek; Parisa Pirzadeh; Amir Yarahmadi; Atena Aghaee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250359,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250359,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
474,Harnessing testing strategies and public health measures to avert COVID-19 outbreaks during ocean cruises,"To ensure the safe operation of schools, workplaces, nursing homes, and other businesses during COVID-19 pandemic there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective public health strategies. Here we focus on the cruise industry which was hit early by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 40 cruise ships reporting COVID-19 infections. We apply mathematical modeling to assess the impact of testing strategies together with social distancing protocols on the spread of the novel coronavirus during ocean cruises using an individual-level stochastic model of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We model the contact network, the potential importation of cases arising during shore excursions, the temporal course of infectivity at the individual level, the effects of social distancing strategies, different testing scenarios characterized by the tests sensitivity profile, and the testing frequency. Our findings indicate that PCR testing at embarkation and daily testing of all individuals aboard, together with increased social distancing and other public health measures, should allow for rapid detection and isolation of COVID-19 infections and dramatically reducing the probability of onboard COVID-19 community spread. In contrast, relying only on PCR testing at embarkation would not be sufficient to avert outbreaks, even when implementing substantial levels of social distancing measures.",Gerardo Chowell; Sushma Dahal; Raquel Bono; Kenji Mizumoto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250408,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250408,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
475,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by rapid antigen test in comparison with RT-PCR in a public setting,"BackgroundRapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential in limiting the spread of infection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR) by comparison with RT-PCR in a public setting.

MethodIndividuals aged 18 years or older who had booked an appointment for a RT-PCR test on December 26-31, 2020 at a public test center in Copenhagen, Denmark, were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, immediately followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the antigen test were calculated with test results from RT-PCR as reference.

ResultsOverall, 4697 individuals were included (female n=2456, 53.3%; mean age: 44.7 years, SD: 16.9 years); 196 individuals were tested twice or more. Among 4811 paired conclusive test results from the RT-PCR and antigen tests, 221 (4.6%) RT-PCR tests were positive. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the antigen test were 69.7% and 99.5%, the positive and negative predictive values were 87.0% and 98.5%. Ct values were significantly higher among individuals with false negative antigen tests compared to true positives.

476,"Distinct Autoimmune Antibody Signatures Between Hospitalized Acute COVID-19 Patients, SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Individuals, and Unexposed Pre-Pandemic Controls","Increasing evidence suggests that autoimmunity may play a role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection during both the acute and  long COVID phases of disease. However, an assessment of autoimmune antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients has not yet been reported.

MethodologyWe compared the levels of 18 different IgG autoantibodies (AABs) between four groups: (1) unexposed pre-pandemic subjects from the general population (n = 29); (2) individuals hospitalized with acute moderate-severe COVID-19 (n = 20); (3) convalescent SARS-COV-2-infected subjects with asymptomatic to mild viral symptoms during the acute phase with samples obtained between 1.8 and 7.3 months after infection (n = 9); and (4) unexposed pre-pandemic subjects with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (n = 6). Total IgG and IgA levels were also measured from subjects in groups 1-3 to assess non-specific pan-B cell activation.

ResultsAs expected, in multivariate analysis, AABs were detected at much higher odds in SLE subjects (5 of 6, 83%) compared to non-SLE pre-pandemic controls (11 of 29, 38%) [odds ratio (OR) 19.4,95% CI, 2.0 - 557.0, p = 0.03]. AAB detection (percentage of subjects with one or more autoantibodies) was higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected convalescent subjects (7 of 9, 78%) [OR 17.4, 95% CI, 2.0 - 287.4, p = 0.02] and subjects with acute COVID-19 (12 of 20, 60%) compared with non-SLE pre-pandemic controls, but was not statistically significant among the latter [OR 1.8,95% CI, 0.6 - 8.1, p = 0.23]. Within the convalescent subject group, AABs were detected in 5/5 with reported persistent symptoms and 2/4 without continued symptoms (p = 0.17). The multivariate computational algorithm Partial Least Squares Determinant Analysis (PLSDA) was used to determine if distinct AAB signatures distinguish subject groups 1-3. Of the 18 autoantibodies measured, anti-Beta 2-Glycoprotein, anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2 and anti-PM/Scl-100 defined the convalescent group; anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2, anti-Jo-1 and anti-RNP/SM defined acute COVID-19 subjects; and anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2, anti-Jo-1, anti-Beta 2-Glycoprotein distinguished unexposed controls. The AABs defining SARS-COV-2 infected from pre-pandemic subjects are widely associated with myopathies, vasculitis, and antiphospholipid syndromes, conditions with some similarities to COVID-19. Compared to pre-pandemic non-SLE controls, subjects with acute COVID-19 had higher total IgG concentration (p-value=0.006) but convalescent subjects did not (p-value=0.08); no differences in total IgA levels were found between groups.

ConclusionsOur findings support existing studies suggesting induction of immune responses to self-epitopes during acute, severe COVID-19 with evidence of general B cell hyperactivation. Also, the preponderance of AAB positivity among convalescent individuals up to seven months after infection indicates potential initiation or proliferation, and then persistence of self-reactive immunity without severe initial disease. These results underscore the importance of further investigation of autoimmunity during SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in the onset and persistence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.",Nahid Bhadelia; Anna Belkina; Alex Olson; Thomas Winter; Patricia Urick; Nina Lin; Ian Rifkin; Yachana Kataria; Rachel Yuen; Manish Sagar; Jennifer Cappione,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249176,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249176,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
477,An interactive COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker (CovMT) with a particular focus on critical mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of the Spike protein,"Almost one year has passed since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of confirmed SARS-Cov-2 cases worldwide has now reached [~]92 million, with 2 million reported deaths (https://covid19.who.int). Nearly 400,000 SARS-Cov-2 genomes were sequenced from COVID-19 samples and added to public resources such as GISAID (https://gisaid.org). With the vaccines becoming available or entering trials (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org), it is vital to keep track of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the Spike proteins Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region, which could have a potential impact on disease severity and treatment strategies.1-3 In the wake of a recent increase in cases with a potentially more infective RBD mutation (N501Y) in the United Kingdom, countries worldwide are concerned about the spread of this or similar variants. Impressive sampling and timely increase in sequencing efforts related to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) helped detect and monitor the spread of the new N501Y variant.

478,Acute and persistent symptoms in non-hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundReports of persistent symptoms after hospitalization with COVID-19 have raised concern of a ""long COVID"" syndrome. This study aimed at characterizing acute and persistent symptoms in non- hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19.

MethodsCohort study of 445 non-hospitalized participants identified via the Danish Civil Registration System with a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR-test and available biobank samples for genetic analyses. Participants received a digital questionnaire on demographics and COVID-19-related symptoms. Persistent symptoms: symptoms >four weeks (in sensitivity analyses >12 weeks).

Results445 participants were included, of whom 34% were asymptomatic. Most common acute symptoms were fatigue, headache, and sneezing, while fatigue and reduced smell and taste were reported as most severe. Persistent symptoms, most commonly fatigue and memory and concentration difficulties, were reported by 36% of 198 symptomatic participants with follow-up >four weeks. Risk factors for persistent symptoms included female sex (women 44% vs. men 24%, odds ratio 2.7, 95%CI:1.4-5.1, p=0.003) and BMI (odds ratio 1.1, 95%CI:1.0-1.2, p=0.001).

MethodsVirus control centered on three pillars: mitigation, containment, and communication, with testing of symptomatic and a random subset of asymptomatic students.

ResultsRandom surveillance testing demonstrated a prevalence among asymptomatic students of 0.4% throughout the term. There were two surges in cases that were contained by enhanced mitigation and communication combined with targeted testing. Cumulative cases totaled 445 for the term, most resulting from unsafe undergraduate student behavior and among students living off-campus. A case rate of 232/10,000 undergraduates equaled or surpassed several peer institutions that conducted mass testing.

480,"COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing For All - Using Non-Dilutive Saliva Sample Collection, Stabilization and Ambient Transport Devices","COVID-19 testing is not accessible for millions during this pandemic despite our best efforts. Without greatly expanded testing of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing and subsequent isolation of spreaders remains as a means for control. In an effort to increase RT-PCR assay testing for the presence of the novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as well as improve sample collection safety, GenTegra LLC has introduced two products for saliva collection and viral RNA stabilization: GTR-STM (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium) and GTR-STMdk (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium Direct to PCR). Both products contain a proprietary formulation based on GenTegras novel ""Active Chemical Protection"" (ACP) technology that gives non-dilutive, error-free saliva sample collection using RNA stabilization chemicals already dried in the collection tube.

GTR-STM can be used for safer saliva-based sample collection at home (or at a test site). Following saliva collection, the sample-containing GTR-STM can be kept at ambient temperature during shipment to an authorized CLIA lab for analysis. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in GTR-STM is stable for over a month at ambient temperature, easily surviving the longest transit times from home to lab. GTR-STM enhances patient comfort, convenience, compliance and reduces infectious virus exposure to essential medical and lab professionals.

Alternatively, the GTR-STMdk direct-into-PCR product can be used to improve lab throughput and reduce reagent costs for saliva sample collection and testing at any lab site with access to refrigeration. GTR-STMdk reduces lab process time by 25% and reagent costs by 30% compared to other approaches. Since GTR-STMdk retains SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA stability for three days at ambient temperature, it is optimized for lab test site rather than at home saliva collection. SARS-COV-2 viral RNA levels as low as 0.4 genome equivalents/uL are detected in saliva samples using GTR-STMdk. The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection can expand COVID-19 testing to include asymptomatic individuals using pooled saliva.

481,High-altitude is associated with better short-term survival in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU,"BackgroundThe novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has affected at least 218 countries worldwide. Some geographical and environmental factors are positively associated with a better or worse prognosis concerning COVID-19 disease and with lower or higher SARS-CoV-2 transmission. High altitude exposure has been associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 attack rates; nevertheless, the role of chronic high-altitude exposure on the clinical outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients has not been studied.

ObjectiveTo compare the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in two intensive care units (ICU) located at low and high altitude.

Exposure and OutcomeTo explore the effect of two different elevations (10 m vs 2,850 m above sea level) on COVID-19 clinical outcome and survival.

MethodsA prospective cohort, two-center study in confirmed COVID-19 adult patients admitted to a low altitude (Sea level) and high altitude (2,850 m) ICU units in Ecuador was conducted. Two hundred and thirty confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled from March 15th to July 15th, 2020. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters including supportive therapies, pharmacological treatments and medical complications were reported and compared between the low and high-altitude groups.

ResultsThe median age of all the patients was 60 years, 64.8% were men and 35.2% were women. A total of 105 (45.7%) patients had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most frequent being chronic diseases, such as hypertension (33.5%), diabetes (16.5%), and chronic kidney failure (5.7%). The APACHE II scale at 72 hours was especially higher in the low-altitude group with a median of 18 points (IQR: 9.5-24.0), compared to 9 points (IQR: 5.0-22.0) obtained in the group of high altitude. There is evidence of a difference in survival in favor of the high-altitude group (p = 0.006), the median survival being 39 days, compared to 21 days in the low altitude group.

ConclusionThere has been a substantial improvement in survival amongst people admitted to the high-altitude critical care unit. High altitude living was associated with improved survival, especially among patients with no comorbidities. COVID-19 patients admitted to the high-altitude ICU unit have improved severity-of-disease classification system scores at 72 hours and reported better respiratory and ventilatory profiles than the low altitude group.",Pablo R Morocho Jaramillo; Katherine Simbana-Rivera; Javier V Velastegui Silva; Lenin Gomez-Barreno; Ana Ventimilla Campoverde; Juan F Novillo Cevallos; Washington Almache Guanoquiza; Silvio Cedeno Guevara; Luis G Imba Castro; Nelson A Moran Puerta; Alex Guayta Valladares; Alex Lister; Esteban Ortiz-Prado,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249811,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249811,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
482,Numbers of close contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their association with government intervention strategies.,"BackgroundContact tracing is conducted with the primary purpose of interrupting transmission from individuals who are likely to be infectious to others. Secondary analyses of data on the numbers of close contacts of confirmed cases could also: provide an early signal of increases in contact patterns that might precede larger than expected case numbers; evaluate the impact of government interventions on the number of contacts of confirmed cases; or provide data information on contact rates between age cohorts for the purpose of epidemiological modelling.

MethodsWe analysed data from 140,204 contacts of 39861 cases in Ireland from 1st May to 1st December 2020. Only  close contacts were included in the analysis. A close contact was defined as any individual who had had > 15 minutes face-to-face (<2 m) contact with a case; any household contact; or any individual sharing a closed space for longer than 2 hours, in any setting.

ResultsThe number of contacts per case was overdispersed, the mean varied considerably over time, and was temporally associated with government interventions. Negative binomial regression models highlighted greater numbers of contacts within specific population demographics, after correcting for temporal associations. Separate segmented regression models of the number of cases over time and the average number of contacts per case indicated that a breakpoint indicating a rapid decrease in the number of contacts per case in October 2020 preceded a breakpoint indicating a reduction in the number of cases by 11 days.

DiscussionThese data were collected for a specific purpose and therefore any inferences must be made with caution. The data are representative of contact rates of cases, and not of the overall population. However, the data may be a more accurate indicator of the likely degree of onward transmission than might be the case if a random sample of the population were taken. Furthermore, since we analysed only the number of close contacts, the total number of contacts per case would have been higher. Nevertheless, this analysis provides useful information for monitoring the impact of government interventions on the number of contacts; for helping pre-empt increases or decreases in case numbers, and for triangulating assumptions regarding the contact mixing rates between different age cohorts for epidemiological modelling.",Conor G McAloon; Patrick Wall; Francis Butler; Mary Codd; Eamonn Gormley; Cathal Walsh; Jim Duggan; T Brendan Murphy; Philip Nolan; Breda Smyth; Katie O'Brien; Conor Teljeur; Martin J Green; Kieran Culhane; Claire Buckley; Jennifer Martin; Sarah Doyle; Ciara Carroll; Simon J More,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250109,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250109,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
483,On mobility trends analysis of COVID-19 dissemination in Mexico City,"This work presents a forecast of the spread of the new coronavirus in Mexico City based on a mathematical model with metapopulation structure by using Bayesian Statistics inspired in a data-driven approach. The mobility of humans on a daily basis in Mexico City is mathematically represented by a origin-destination matrix using the open mobility data from Google and a Transportation Mexican Survey. This matrix, is incorporated in a compartmental model. We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between February 27, 2020 and October 27, 2020 using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Since working with metapopulation models lead to rather high computational time consume, we do a clustering analysis based on mobility trends in order to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis could be implemented in smaller or lager scale in different part of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided in the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict the individuals movement in the city. Also, we calculate the reproductive number in Mexico City using the next generation operator method and the inferred model parameters.

484,Predictive power of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance for diverse populations across a large geographical range,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the disparities in healthcare delivery in the US. Many communities had, and continue to have, limited access to COVID-19 testing, making it difficult to track the spread and impact of COVID-19 in early days of the outbreak. To address this issue we monitored severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA at the population-level using municipal wastewater influent from 19 cities across the state of Minnesota during the COVID-19 outbreak in Summer 2020. Viral RNA was detected in wastewater continually for 20-weeks for cities ranging in populations from 500 to >1, 000, 000. Using a novel indexing method, we were able to compare the relative levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for each city during this sampling period. Our data showed that viral RNA trends appeared to precede clinically confirmed cases across the state by several days. Lag analysis of statewide trends confirmed that wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels preceded new clinical cases by 15-17 days. At the regional level, new clinical cases lagged behind wastewater viral RNA anywhere from 4-20 days. Our data illustrates the advantages of monitoring at the population-level to detect outbreaks.

MethodsUsing linear and exponential time series analysis, this research aimed at studying the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in 18 countries during the first six months of the pandemic, and further utilize multivariate techniques to explain the variance in monthly exponential growth rates of cases and deaths with aid of a set of different predictors: the recorded Google mobility trends towards six categories of places, daily average temperature, daily humidity, and key socioeconomic attributes of each country.

ResultsThe analysis showed that changes in mobility trends were the most significant predictors of the incidence and mortality rates, temperature and humidity were also significant but to a much lesser extent, on the other hand, the socioeconomic attributes did not contribute significantly to explaining different incidence and mortality rates across countries.

ConclusionChanges in mobility trends across countries dramatically affected the incidence and mortality rates across different countries, thus, it might be used as a proxy measure of contact frequency.",Noha Asem; Ahmed Mohamed Ramadan; Mohamed Hassany; Ramy Mohamed Ghazy; Mohamed Abdallah; Eman Gamal; Shimaa Hassan; Nehal Kamal; Hala Zaid,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250226,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250226,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
486,"Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries","ObjectiveTo assess whether the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors characterize initial vulnerability to the virus.

MethodsWe fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0.

FindingsWe found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors-population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality-as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

487,Rates of serious clinical outcomes in survivors of hospitalisation with COVID-19: a descriptive cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform,"BackgroundPatients with COVID-19 are thought to be at higher risk of cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications, but quantification of that risk is limited. We aimed to describe the overall burden of these complications in survivors of severe COVID-19.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform linking primary care records to death certificate and hospital data. We constructed two cohorts: a COVID-19 cohort consisting of patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, and a comparison population of patients discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019. Outcomes included DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and new type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Outcome rates from hospital discharge were measured in each cohort, stratified by patient demographics and 30-day period. We fitted Cox regression models to estimate crude and age/sex adjusted hazard ratios comparing outcome rates between the two cohorts.

ResultsAmongst the population of 31,569 patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, the highest rates were observed for heart failure (199.3; 95% CI: 191.8 - 207.1) and AKI (154.5; 95% CI: 147.9 - 161.4). Rates of DVT, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, MI, PE and diabetes were high over the four months post discharge, especially in the first month. Patterns were broadly similar to those seen in patients discharged with pneumonia but somewhat higher in the COVID-19 population for stroke (adj-HR 1.78; 95% CI: 1.53 - 2.08), PE (adj-HR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.21 - 1.58), MI (adj-HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.76), AKI (adj-HR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.19 - 1.36) and T2DM (adj-HR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.50).

ConclusionsIn this descriptive study of survivors of severe COVID-19, rates of the measured outcomes are at least as high, though in some cases slightly higher, than in patients discharged after hospitalisation with pneumonia.

488,Using Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and High Isolation of Asymptomatic Carriers to Contain the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes,"ObjectiveUsing a pandemic influenza model modified for COVID-19, this study investigated the degree of control over pre-symptomatic transmission that common non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would require to reduce the spread in long-term care facilities.

MethodsWe created a stochastic compartmental SEIR model with Poisson-distributed transition states that compared the effect of R0, common NPIs, and isolation rates of pre-symptomatic carriers primarily on attack rate, peak cases, and timing in a 200-resident nursing home. Model sensitivity was assessed with 1st order Sobol indices.

ResultsThe most rigorous NPIs decreased the peak number of infections by 4.3 and delayed the peak by 9.7 days in the absence of pre-symptomatic controls. Reductions in attack rate were not likely, even with rigorous application of all defined NPIs, unless pre-symptomatic carriers were identified and isolated at rates exceeding 76%. Attack rate was most sensitive to the pre-symptomatic isolation rate (Sobol index > 0.7) and secondarily to R0.

ConclusionsCommon NPIs delayed and reduced epidemic peaks. Reducing attack rates ultimately required efficient isolation of pre-symptomatic cases, including rapid antigen tests on a nearly daily basis. This must be accounted for in testing and contact tracing plans for group living settings.",Alec J Schmidt; Yury Garcia; Diego Pinheiro; Tom Reichert; Miriam Nuno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249308,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249308,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
489,Tracking the mental health of home-carers during the first COVID-19 national lockdown: evidence from a nationally representative UK survey,"BackgroundUnpaid carers who look after another member of their household (home-carers) have poorer mental health than the general population. The first COVID-19 national lockdown led to an increasing reliance on home-carers and we investigate the short and longer-term impact of lockdown on their mental health.

MethodsData from 9,737 adult participants (aged 16+) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) were used to explore changes in 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score between (a) pre-pandemic (2019) and early lockdown (April 2020) and (b) early and later (July 2020) lockdown.

ResultsGHQ-12 scores among home-carers were higher pre-lockdown and increased more than for non-carers from 2019 to April 2020 with further increases for home-carers compared with non-carers between April and July. Compared with respondents caring for a spouse/partner, those caring for a child under 18 had a particularly marked increase in GHQ-12 score between 2019 and April, as did those caring for someone with learning difficulties. Home-carers of children under 18 improved from April to July while those caring for adult children saw a marked worsening of their mental health. Home-carers with greater care burden saw larger increases in GHQ-12 score from 2019 to April and from April to July, and increases through both periods were greater for home-carers who had formal help prior to lockdown but then lost it.

ConclusionsThe mental health of home-carers deteriorated more during lockdown than non-carers. Policies that reinstate support for them and their care-recipients will benefit the health of both vulnerable groups.

What is already known on this topicO_LICarers have poorer mental health than the general population.
C_LIO_LIAmong carers who live with the care recipient (home-carers), some subgroups have poorer mental health than others: female versus male; those who provide more hours of care and have been caring for longer; spousal carers compared with those caring for children (including adult), parents, or other relationships; those caring for individuals whose impairment results in behavioural disturbances, than those who care for individuals with physical or long-term health conditions.

490,An external validation of the QCovid risk prediction algorithm for risk of mortality from COVID-19 in adults: national validation cohort study in England,"BackgroundTo externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study using the ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort based on the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service Data for pandemic planning and research, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two time periods were used: (a) 24th January to 30th April 2020; and (b) 1st May to 28th July 2020. We evaluated the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration for each validation time period.

FindingsThe study comprises 34,897,648 adults aged 19-100 years resident in England. There were 26,985 COVID-19 deaths during the first time-period and 13,177 during the second. The algorithms had good calibration in the validation cohort in both time periods with close correspondence of observed and predicted risks. They explained 77.1% (95% CI: 76.9% to 77.4%) of the variation in time to death in men in the first time-period (R2); the D statistic was 3.76 (95% CI: 3.73 to 3.79); Harrells C was 0.935 (0.933 to 0.937). Similar results were obtained for women, and in the second time-period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first time period was 65.9% for men and 71.7% for women. People in the top 20% of predicted risks of death accounted for 90.8% of all COVID-19 deaths for men and 93.0% for women.

InterpretationThe QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. It has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPublic policy measures and clinical risk assessment relevant to COVID-19 need to be aided by rigorously developed and validated risk prediction models. A recent living systematic review of published risk prediction models for COVID-19 found most models are subject to a high risk of bias with optimistic reported performance, raising concern that these models may be unreliable when applied in practice. A population-based risk prediction model, QCovid risk prediction algorithm, has recently been developed to identify adults at high risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, which overcome many of the limitations of previous tools.

Added value of this studyCommissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for England, we validated the novel clinical risk prediction model (QCovid) to identify risks of short-term severe outcomes due to COVID-19. We used national linked datasets from general practice, death registry and hospital episode data for a population-representative sample of over 34 million adults. The risk models have excellent discrimination in men and women (Harrells C statistic>0.9) and are well calibrated. QCovid represents a new, evidence-based opportunity for population risk-stratification.

Implications of all the available evidenceQCovid has the potential to support public health policy, from enabling shared decision making between clinicians and patients in relation to health and work risks, to targeted recruitment for clinical trials, and prioritisation of vaccination, for example.",Vahe Nafilyan; Ben Humberstone; Nisha Metha; Ian Diamond; Luke Lorenzi; Piotr Pawelek; Ryan Schofield; Jasper Morgan; Paul Brown; Ronan Lyons; Aziz Sheikh; Julia Hippisley-Cox,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249968,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249968,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
491,Using an Ecological and Biological Framing for an Anti-racist Covid-19 Approach,"In the United States and the United Kingdom COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people respectively. Multiple studies identify environmental factors such as overcrowded housing and poor workplace conditions as contributing factors for the disproportionate COVID-19 rates amongst BAME and BIPOC communities. This paper will show that to fully understand the phenomenon, both an ecological and biological approach is needed. An ecological approach highlights how a persons habitat and the experiences within it mediate their susceptibility to disease. Moreover, to understand how this mediation works, this paper will use allostatic load as a biological pathway to link a person to their habitat and the poor health outcomes that contributed to COVID-19 susceptibility. In introducing this new approach, the paper will serve as an anti-racist framework for understanding how COVID-19 affected BAME and BIPOC communities. It is anti-racist by centring poor health outcomes on the habitats people are forced to live in due to structural racism rather than the physiology of a persons race or ethnicity.

492,Existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient particulate matter samples: A nationwide study in Turkey,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has been affecting the world since the end of 2019. Turkey is severely affected with the first case being reported on March 11th 2020. Ambient particulate matter (PM) samples in various size ranges were collected from 13 sites including urban and urban background locations and hospital gardens in 10 cities across Turkey between the 13th of May and the 14th of June, 2020 to investigate a possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient PM. A total of 155 daily samples (TSP, n=80; PM2.5, n=33; PM2.5-10, n=23; PM10, n=19; and 6 size segregated, n=48) were collected using various samplers in each city. The N1 gene and RdRP gene expressions were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to RT-PCR and 3D-RT-PCR analysis, dual RdRP and N1 gene positivity were detected in 20 (9.8 %) of the samples. The highest percentage of virus detection on PM samples was from hospital gardens in Tekirda[g], Zonguldak, and [I]stanbul--especially in PM2.5 mode. Samples collected from two urban sites were also positive. Findings of this study have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be transported by ambient particles especially at sites close to the infection hot-spots. However, whether this has an impact on the spread of the virus infection remains to be determined.

Significance StatementAlthough there are several studies reporting the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor aerosols is established, it remains unclear whether the virus is transported by ambient atmospheric particles. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ambient particles collected from characteristic sites within various size ranges was investigated, and positive results were found in urban sites especially around Turkish hospitals. In this context, this study offers a new discussion on the transmission of the virus via ambient particles.",Ozgecan Kayalar; Akif Ari; Gizem Babuccu; Nur Konyalilar; Ozlem Dogan; Fusun Can; Ulku Alver Sahin; Eftade Gaga; Levent Kuzu; Pelin Ari; Mustafa Odabasi; Yucel Tasdemir; Siddik Cindoruk; Fatma Esen; Egemen Sakin; Burak Caliskan; Lokman Tecer; Merve Ficici; Ahmet Altin; Burcu Onat; Coskun Ayvaz; Burcu Uzun; Arslan Saral; Tuncay Dogeroglu; Semra Malkoc; Ozlem Uzmez; Fatma Kunt; Senar Aydin; Melik Kara; Baris Yaman; Guray Dogan; Bihter Olgun; Ebru Dokumaci; Gulen Gullu; Elif Uzunpinar; Hasan Bayram,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250391,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250391,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True

494,Analytical and clinical evaluation of antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies used in Finland in 2020,"BackgroundSensitive and highly specific antibody tests are critical for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies especially in populations where seroprevalence is low.

AimTo set up, optimize and evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of a new in-house microsphere immunoassay for measurement of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein for assessment of population seroprevalence in Finland.

MethodsWe set up a new in-house microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) with SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and optimized its analytical performance. For evaluation of clinical performance, we tested sera collected in a well-characterized cohort of PCR positive-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=89) with mostly mild symptoms, and before the COVID-19 pandemic (n=402), for nucleoprotein specific IgG concentrations by FMIA and a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay and for neutralizing antibodies by the microneutralization test.

ResultsThe analytical performance of FMIA was established in terms of sensitivity, linearity and precision. FMIA discriminated between COVID-19 patient and control samples with high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (100%). We generated FMIA seropositivity cut-offs, 0.46 and 1.71 U/ml, for low- and high-seroprevalence settings, respectively. In addition, we obtained high level of agreement between FMIA results and results by the microneutralization test.

ConclusionThe fluorescent microsphere immunoassay showed excellent analytical and clinical performance and is well suited for serosurveillance studies of SARS-CoV-2.

496,Prediction of In-hospital Mortality among Adults with COVID-19 Infection,"Prediction of mortality from COVID-19 infection might help triage patients to hospitalization and intensive care. To estimate the risk of inpatient mortality, we analyzed the data of 13,190 adult patients in the New York City Health + Hospitals system admitted for COVID-19 infection from March 1 to June 30, 2020. They had a mean age 58 years, 40% were Latinx, 29% Black, 9% White and 22% of other races/ethnicities and 2,875 died. We used Machine learning (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees; XGBoost) to select predictors of inpatient mortality from demographics, vital signs and lab tests results from initial encounters. XGBoost identified O2 saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, age, and BUN with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve = 94%. We applied CART to find cut-points in these variables, logistic regression to calculate odds-ratios for those categories, and assigned points to the categories to develop a score. A score = 0 indicates a 0.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.5 - 1.0%) risk of dying and [&ge;] 12 points indicates a 98% (97-99%) risk, and other scores have intermediate risks. We translated the models into an online calculator for the probability of mortality with 95% confidence intervals (as pictured):

497,Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) status in people with suspected COVID-19: Secondary analysis of the PRIEST observational cohort study,"BackgroundCardiac arrest is common in people admitted with suspected COVID-19 and has a poor prognosis. Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders can reduce the risk of futile resuscitation attempts but have raised ethical concerns.

ObjectivesWe aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of adults admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 according to their DNAR status and identify factors associated with an early DNAR decision.

MethodsWe undertook a secondary analysis of 13977 adults admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 and included in the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage (PRIEST) study. We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNAR (occurring before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNAR (no DNAR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNAR.

ResultsWe excluded 1249 with missing DNAR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNAR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNAR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%). On multivariable analysis, older age (p<0.001), active malignancy (p<0.001), chronic lung disease (p<0.001), limited performance status (p<0.001), and abnormal physiological variables were associated with increased recording of early DNAR. Asian ethnicity was associated with reduced recording of early DNAR (p=0.001).

ConclusionsEarly DNAR decisions were associated with recognised predictors of adverse outcome, and were also associated with Asian ethnicity. Most people with an early DNAR decision survived to 30 days and many received potentially life-saving interventions.

Being a continental country, which comprises many ethnic groups and an engrained social inequality, the pandemic evidenced this heterogeneous discrepancy. We aimed to estimate the impact of associated risk factors, isolated or combined, on COVID-19 severeness, detecting specific epidemiological profiles for multiple age ranges in hospitalized Brazilians.

MethodsIn this large retrospective cohort study, we used open-access data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil with COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients annotated in SRAG system between February and August 2020, a total of 235555 entries. The association of COVID-19 death with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics was analysed and presented as odds ratios adjusted by confounding co-variables. We also presented marginal mean aOR values for high-order interactions either by or not another fixed level or condition. We kept all other variables in the multivariate logistic models in their mean values or equal proportions.

FindingsYounger individuals with one or more comorbidities had an adjusted odds ratio up to four-fold compared to those without it, in the same age interval. Younger diabetic patients either self-declared as brown ethnicity (aOR 5{middle dot}58, 95% CI 4{middle dot}97-6{middle dot}25; p<0{middle dot}0001) or with some other associated comorbidities, mainly chronic hematologic disease (21{middle dot}09, 13{middle dot}64-32{middle dot}6; p<0{middle dot}0001) and obesity (aOR 21{middle dot}7, 95% CI not calculated; p<0{middle dot}0001), resulted in outstanding death risk. Age over 60, particularly over 90 (28{middle dot}91, 24{middle dot}5-34{middle dot}11; p<0.001), usage of invasive ventilatory support (16{middle dot}23, 14{middle dot}05-18{middle dot}75; p<0{middle dot}001), admission to intensive care units (3{middle dot}14, 2{middle dot}82-3{middle dot}48; p<0{middle dot}001), multiple respiratory symptoms (3{middle dot}24, 2{middle dot}79-3{middle dot}75; p<0{middle dot}0001), black ethnicity (1{middle dot}78, 1{middle dot}52-2{middle dot}07; p<0{middle dot}05), and diagnosis previous to hospitalization (1{middle dot}32, 1{middle dot}19-1{middle dot}47; p<0{middle dot}05) were associated with higher death odds. As protective factors, with roughly one third less death risk, we found hospitalization duration of (4, 7] days and illness onset to hospitalization over 6 days.

InterpretationWe found evidence for increased COVID-19 risk in two distinct groups: younger patients with prevalent comorbidities, especially in brown ethnicity, and patients with black ethnicity. We speculate that the pro-inflammatory synergism of COVID-19 and comorbidities, promoting an overproduction of cytokines, is partially the cause of higher mortality in this young group. Brazilian black and brown are underprivileged populations, with structural social inequality, limited healthcare access and, thus, remarkable disease vulnerability. Our study supplies essential data to patient stratification upon admission, optimizing hospital management, and to guide public policy determinations, including group prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in context

Evidence before this studyCOVID-19 is still very active, having spread to over two hundred countries and caused more than one million deaths worldwide. Its current situation requires large-scale studies to assess the impact of preexisting comorbidities, symptoms, and socioeconomic issues regarding mortality rate, especially where lack of control is evident. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv on Dec 12, 2020, for studies published in English or Brazilian Portuguese, estimating the impact of several risk factors in COVID-19 prognosis. We used the search terms ""Brazil"" or ""risk factors"" or ""ethnicity"" or ""cohort"" or ""diabetes mellitus"" or ""mortality"" or ""symptoms"" or ""comorbidities"", and related synonyms, combined with ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""COVID-19"". Many pre-existing conditions have shown to directly impact patient prognosis, out of which cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, among others, are well established in SARS-CoV-2 infection severeness. Some studies reported an increased death risk for non-white Brazilians, but no large scale cohort analyzing the impact of one or more associated risk factors in younger Brazilians patients were found.

Added value of this studyWe found that the impact of having one or two or more risk factors on mortality are progressively higher in ages (60, 80], (40, 60], (20, 40], and (0, 20], compared with people of the same age interval without comorbidities. We also found that young brown individuals with diabetes, as well as black ethnicity on its own, are population subgroups at remarkably higher risk for severe COVID-19 in Brazil. Furthermore, advanced age, usage of ventilatory support, admission to intensive care units, multiple respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis previous to hospitalization were associated with higher death odds. As protective factors, we found hospitalization duration of (4, 7] days and illness onset to hospitalization over 6 days.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe identified multiple epidemiological profiles associated with death risk in different age ranges in Brazilian COVID-19 hospitalized patients. These findings unveil that a large part of Brazilian working-age population is at a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 death, a neglected situation that is further exacerbating inequalities, leading to a striking sociodemographic and economic impact. We hope that our analysis aids patient risk stratification, hospital management optimization, and public policy determination, including prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil.

499,Mental health and wellbeing amongst people with informal caring responsibilities across different time points during the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based propensity score matching analysis,"AimsDue to a prolonged period of national and regional lockdown measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an increase reliance on informal care and a consequent increase in care intensity for informal carers. In light of this, the current study compared the experiences of carers and non-carers on various mental health and wellbeing measures across 5 key time points during the pandemic.

MethodsData analysed were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. Our study focused on 5 time points in England: (i) the first national lockdown (March-April 2020; N=12,053); (ii) the beginning of lockdown rules easing (May 2020; N=24,374); (iii) further easing (July 2020; N=21,395); (iv) new COVID-19 restrictions (September 2020; N=4,792); and (v) the three-tier system restrictions (October 2020; N=4,526). We considered 5 mental health and wellbeing measures-depression, anxiety, loneliness, life satisfaction and sense of worthwhile. Propensity score matching were applied for the analyses.

ResultsWe found that informal carers experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety than non-carers across all time points. During the first national lockdown, carers also experienced a higher sense of life being worthwhile. No association was found between informal caring responsibilities and levels of loneliness and life satisfaction.

ConclusionGiven that carers are an essential national health care support, especially during a pandemic, it is crucial to integrate carers needs into healthcare planning and delivery. These results highlight there is a pressing need to provide adequate and targeted mental health support for carers during and following this pandemic.",Hei Wan Mak; Feifei Bu; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250045,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250045,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
500,High-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater provides insights into circulating variants,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from a zoonotic spill-over event and has led to a global pandemic. The public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data from 52 samples with >90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients. We identified 7973 SNVs, of which 5680 were ""novel"" SNVs that had not yet been identified in the global clinical-derived data as of 17th June 2020 (the day after our last wastewater sampling date). However, between 17th of June 2020 and 20th November 2020, almost half of the SNVs have since been detected in clinical-derived data. Using the combination of SNVs present in each sample, we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to lineages observed in North America prior to our sampling dates. The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical-derived data. Principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples, with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates. We demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis combined with SNVs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic population structure circulating within a community, which might not be observed if relying solely on clinical cases.",Rafaela S.

501,Ubiquitin ligase RIPLET mediates polyubiquitination of RIG-I and LGP2 and regulates the innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"RIG-I, a cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor, is crucial for innate antiviral immune responses; however, there are controversies about RIG-Is regulatory mechanism by several ubiquitin ligases and LGP2. Our genetic study revealed that the RIPLET ubiquitin ligase was a general activating factor for RIG-I signaling, whereas another ubiquitin ligase, TRIM25, activated RIG-I in a cell-type-specific manner. These RIPLET and TRIM25 functions were modulated by accessory factors, such as ZCCH3C and NLRP12. Interestingly, we found an additional role of RIPLET in innate immune responses. RIPLET induced delayed polyubiquitination of LGP, resulting in the attenuation of excessive cytokine expression at the late phase. Moreover, RIPLET was involved in the innate immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection, a cause of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our data indicate that RIPLET fine-tunes innate immune responses via polyubiquitination of RIG-I and LGP2 against virus infection, including SARS-CoV-2.",Takahisa Kouwaki; Tasuku Nishimura; Guanming Wang; Reiko Nakagawa; Hiroyuki Oshiumi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428042,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428042,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
502,A multiscale model suggests that a moderately weak inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I IFN could accelerate the clearance of the virus,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible RNA virus that emerged in China at the end of 2019 and caused a large global outbreak. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune response is complex because it is regulated by various processes taking part at the intracellular, tissue, and host levels. To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19, we formulate a multiscale model that integrate the main mechanisms which regulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 across multiple scales. The model describes the effect of type I interferon on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside cells. At the tissue level, we simulate the interactions between infected cells and immune cells using a hybrid agent-based representation. At the same time, we model the dynamics of virus spread and adaptive immune response in the host organism. After model validation, we demonstrate that a moderately weak inhibition of virus replication by type I IFN could elicit a strong adaptive immune response which accelerates the clearance of the virus. Furthermore, numerical simulations suggest that the deficiency of lymphocytes and not dendritic cells could lead to unfavourable outcomes in the elderly population.",Anass Bouchnita; Alexey Tokarev; Vitaly Volpert,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427896,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427896,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
503,Next generation vaccine platform: polymersomes as stable nanocarriers for a highly immunogenic and durable SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit vaccine,"Multiple successful vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to address the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In the present work, we describe a subunit vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein co-administered with CpG adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of our formulation, both antigen and adjuvant were encapsulated with our proprietary artificial cell membrane (ACM) polymersome technology. Structurally, ACM polymersomes are self-assembling nanoscale vesicles made up of an amphiphilic block copolymer comprising of polybutadiene-b-polyethylene glycol and a cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane. Functionally, ACM polymersomes serve as delivery vehicles that are efficiently taken up by dendritic cells, which are key initiators of the adaptive immune response. Two doses of our formulation elicit robust neutralizing titers in C57BL/6 mice that persist at least 40 days. Furthermore, we confirm the presence of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that produce Th1 cytokines. This study is an important step towards the development of an efficacious vaccine in humans.",Jian Hang Lam; Amit Kumar Khan; Thomas Andrew Cornell; Regine Josefine Dress; Teck Wan Chia; Wen Wang William Yeow; Nur Khairiah Mohd-Ismail; Shrinivas Venkatraman; Kim Tien Ng; Yee-Joo Tan; Danielle E.

504,"Effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on protein stability, cleavage, and cell-cell fusion function","The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is the sole viral protein responsible for both viral binding to a host cell and the membrane fusion event needed for cell entry. In addition to facilitating fusion needed for viral entry, S can also drive cell-cell fusion, a pathogenic effect observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. While several studies have investigated S requirements involved in viral particle entry, examination of S stability and factors involved in S cell-cell fusion remain limited. We demonstrate that S must be processed at the S1/S2 border in order to mediate cell-cell fusion, and that mutations at potential cleavage sites within the S2 subunit alter S processing at the S1/S2 border, thus preventing cell-cell fusion. We also identify residues within the internal fusion peptide and the cytoplasmic tail that modulate S cell-cell fusion. Additionally, we examine S stability and protein cleavage kinetics in a variety of mammalian cell lines, including a bat cell line related to the likely reservoir species for SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that proteolytic processing alters the stability of the S trimer. This work therefore offers insight into S stability, proteolytic processing, and factors that mediate S cell-cell fusion, all of which help give a more comprehensive understanding of this highly sought-after therapeutic target.",Chelsea T.

505,Lost in translation: codon optimization inactivates SARS-CoV-2 RdRp,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a primary target for antivirals. We report that Nsp12, a catalytic subunit of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, produces an inactive enzyme when codon-optimized for bacterial expression. We also show that accessory subunits, NTPs, and translation by slow ribosomes partially rescue Nsp12. Our findings have implications for functional studies and identification of novel inhibitors of RdRp and for rational design of other biotechnologically and medically important expression systems.",Bing Wang; Vladimir Svetlov; Evgeny Nudler; Irina Artsimovitch,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.428004,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.428004,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
506,Molecular Dynamics Reveals the Effects of Temperature on Critical SARS-CoV-2 Proteins,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified RNA virus that causes the serious infection Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The incidence of COVID-19 is still increasing worldwide despite the summer heat and cool winter. However, little is known about seasonal stability of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the effect of temperature on four critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Our work demonstrates that the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Main protease (Mpro), and nonstructural protein 3 (macro X) possesses extreme thermos-stability when subjected to temperature variations rendering them attractive drug targets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these four proteins are well adapted to habitable temperatures on earth and are largely insensitive to cold and warm climates. Furthermore, we report that the critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD were less responsive to temperature variations as compared to the critical residues in SARS-CoV. As such, extreme summer and winter climates, and the transition between the two seasons, are expected to have a negligible effect on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which will marginally suppress transmission rates until effective therapeutics are available world-wide.",Paul Morgan; Chih-Wen Shu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427990,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427990,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
507,mRNA-1273 efficacy in a severe COVID-19 model: attenuated activation of pulmonary immune cells after challenge,"The mRNA-1273 vaccine was recently determined to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from interim Phase 3 results. Human studies, however, cannot provide the controlled response to infection and complex immunological insight that are only possible with preclinical studies. Hamsters are the only model that reliably exhibit more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease similar to hospitalized patients, making them pertinent for vaccine evaluation. We demonstrate that prime or prime-boost administration of mRNA-1273 in hamsters elicited robust neutralizing antibodies, ameliorated weight loss, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in the airways, and better protected against disease at the highest prime-boost dose. Unlike in mice and non-human primates, mRNA-1273- mediated immunity was non-sterilizing and coincided with an anamnestic response. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue permitted high resolution analysis which is not possible in vaccinated humans. mRNA-1273 prevented inflammatory cell infiltration and the reduction of lymphocyte proportions, but enabled antiviral responses conducive to lung homeostasis. Surprisingly, infection triggered transcriptome programs in some types of immune cells from vaccinated hamsters that were shared, albeit attenuated, with mock-vaccinated hamsters. Our results support the use of mRNA-1273 in a two-dose schedule and provides insight into the potential responses within the lungs of vaccinated humans who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428136,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428136,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
508,Profiling transcription factor sub-networks in type I interferon signaling and in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Type I interferons (IFN /{beta}) play a central role in innate immunity to respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. Genetic defects in type I interferon signaling were reported in a significant proportion of critically ill CoOVID-19 patients. Extensive studies on interferon-induced intracellular signal transduction pathways led to the elucidation of the Jak-Stat pathway. Furthermore, advances in gene expression profiling by microarrays have revealed that type I interferon rapidly induced multiple transcription factor mRNA levels. In this study, transcription factor profiling in the transcriptome was used to gain novel insights into the role of inducible transcription factors in response to type I interferon signaling in immune cells and in lung epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Modeling the interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA data in terms of distinct sub-networks based on biological functions such as antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell growth revealed enrichment of specific transcription factors in mouse and human immune cells. The evolutionarily conserved core type I interferon gene expression consists of the inducible transcriptional factor mRNA of the antiviral response sub-network and enriched in granulocytes. Analysis of the type I interferon-inducible transcription factor sub-networks as distinct protein-protein interaction pathways revealed insights into the role of critical hubs in signaling. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that SARS-CoV-2 induced high levels of IFN-beta and interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA in human lung epithelial cells. Transcription factor mRNA of the three major sub-networks regulating antiviral, immune modulation, and cell growth were differentially regulated in human lung epithelial cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. A subset of type I interferon-inducible transcription factors and inflammatory mediators were specifically enriched in the lungs and neutrophils of Covid-19 patients. The emerging complex picture of type I IFN transcriptional regulation consists of a rapid transcriptional switch mediated by the Jak-Stat cascade and a graded output of the inducible transcription factor activation that enables temporal regulation of gene expression.",Ramana Chilakamarti,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428122,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428122,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
509,Longitudinal analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in convalescent individuals up to 8 months post-symptom onset,"Functional and lasting immune responses to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are currently under intense investigation as antibody titers in plasma have been shown to decline during convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients. In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance. Even though overall circulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contract over time during convalescence, we demonstrate that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up to 8 months post symptom onset. We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month period. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical for the prevention of secondary infections, vaccine efficacy and herd immunity against COVID-19.",Sai Priya Anand; Jeremie Prevost; Manon Nayrac; Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres; Mehdi Benlarbi; Romain Gasser; Nathalie Brassard; Annemarie Laumaea; Shang Yu Gong; Catherine Bourassa; Elsa Brunet-Ratnasingham; Halima Medjahed; Gabrielle Gendron-Lepage; Guillaume Goyette; Laurie Gokool; Chantal Morrisseau; Philippe Begin; Valerie Martel-Laferriere; Cecile Tremblay; Jonathan Richard; Renee Bazin; Ralf Duerr; Daniel E Kaufmann; Andres Finzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428097,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428097,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
