0,Covid-19 in children: is there any correlation with renal function and severity of the disease?,"Abstract Background. Kidney manifestations are life-threatening conditions, such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), especially when attributed to viral infections. The severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an emerging health problem worldwide, potentially affecting all organs, including the kidney. Most reports on kidney manifestations were conducted mostly on the adult and elderly population, and limited on children. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the correlation between kidney manifestations with the renal function of pediatric patients suffering from COVID-19. Methods. An observational analytic study was conducted in Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, from March to August 2020. The demographic data, clinical signs, laboratory results, and notable kidney function were analysed, while the disease was classified as severe and nonsevere based on its clinical appearance. The Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric was used to analyze the collected data. Results. In this study, 16 COVID-19 children were selected as the research subjects, the median eGFR value in the severe group was lower (49.59 ml / minute / 1.73m2) compared to the nonsevere (113 ml / minute / 1.73m2), however, not statistically significant (p = 0.521). Significant high CRP and low thrombocyte levels were found in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.05). Conclusion. A severe SARS-CoV-2 infection tends to affect the kidney, which is manifested as decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).",Dedi Rachmadi Sambas; Ahmedz AW Widiasta; Dany Hilmanto; Hadyana Sukandar; Nanan Sekarwana,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216440,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216440,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
1,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Southern Region of New Zealand, 2020","Background: During New Zealand's first outbreak in early 2020 the Southern Region had the highest per capita SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. PCR testing was initially limited by a narrow case definition and limited laboratory capacity, so cases may have been missed. Objectives: To evaluate the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-confirmed and probable cases, contacts, and higher risk individuals in the Southern Region of NZ. Study design: Pre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=78) to establish sensitivity. For prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with grey-zone (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. Results: The median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed cases was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI, 98.2%-99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI, 66.0%-85.7%). Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7-94.9%. Nine previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had epidemiological risk factors. Conclusions: Spike-based assays demonstrated higher sensitivity than the Abbott IgG assay, likely due to temporal differences in antibody persistence. No unexpected SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the Southern region of NZ, supporting the elimination status of the country at the time this study was conducted.",Alyson Craigie; Reuben McGregor; Alana Whitcombe; Lauren Carlton; David Harte; Michelle Sutherland; Matthew Parry; Erasmus Smit; Gary McAuliffe; James Ussher; Nicole Moreland; Susan Jack; Arlo Upton,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215616,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215616,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
2,COVID-19 adaptive humoral immunity models: non-neutralizing versus antibody-disease enhancement scenarios,"The interplay between the virus, infected cells and the immune ressponses to SARS-CoV-2 is still under debate. Extending the basic model of viral dynamics we propose here a formal approach to describe the neutralizing versus non-neutralizing scenarios and compare with the possible effects of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The theoretical model is consistent with data available from the literature and conclusions show that, while both non-neutralizing scenarios and ADE give rise to similar final virus clearance, the non-neutralizing antibodies can induce permanent high levels of antibody production with documented unfavorable impact on the disease progression and outcome. We also discuss the implications on secondary infections.",Antoine Danchin; Oriane Pagani-Azizi; Gabriel TURINICI; Ghozlane Yahiaoui,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216713,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216713,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
3,Mathematical Analysis of COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics. A Case Study with Nigeria,"Abstract: In this article, we formulated a mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease and we introduced quarantined and isolated compartments. The next generation matrix method was adopted to compute the basic reproduction number in order to assess the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 deadly disease. Stability analysis of the disease free equilibrium is investigated based on the basic reproduction number and the result shows that it is locally and asymptotically stable for less than 1. Numerical calculation of the basic reproduction number revealed that which means that the disease can be eradicated from Nigeria. The study shows that isolation, quarantine and other government policies like social distancing and lockdown are the best approaches to control the pernicious nature of COVID-19 pandemic.

4,Early intervention is the key to success in COVID-19 control,"New Zealand responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with a combination of border restrictions and an Alert Level system that included strict stay-at-home orders. These interventions were successful in containing the outbreak and ultimately eliminating community transmission of COVID-19. The timing of interventions is crucial to their success. Delaying interventions for too long may both reduce their effectiveness and mean that they need to be maintained for a longer period of time. Here, we use a stochastic branching process model of COVID-19 transmission and control to simulate the epidemic trajectory in New Zealand and the effect of its interventions during its COVID-19 outbreak in March-April 2020. We use the model to calculate key outcomes, including the peak load on the contact tracing system, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the probability of elimination within a specified time frame. We investigate the sensitivity of these outcomes to variations in the timing of the interventions. We find that a delay to the introduction of Alert Level 4 controls results in considerably worse outcomes. Changes in the timing of border measures have a smaller effect. We conclude that the rapid response in introducing stay-at-home orders was crucial in reducing the number of cases and deaths and increasing the probability of elimination.",Rachelle N Binny; Michael G Baker; Shaun C Hendy; Alex James; Audrey Lustig; Michael J Plank; Kannan M Ridings; Nicholas Steyn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216457,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216457,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
5,Supervised self-collected SARS-CoV-2 testing in indoor summer camps to inform school reopening,"Background and Objectives: Testing strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in school settings are needed to assess the efficacy of infection mitigation strategies and inform school reopening policies. We hypothesized that supervised serial self-collected non-nasopharyngeal testing in summer camp settings would be acceptable and feasible. Methods: We performed a cohort study at two urban day camps for kindergarten-8th graders in June and July 2020. Eligible participants were campers, up to two adult household contacts, and camp staff. We assessed participation rates for providing, at two time points, supervised, self-collected anterior nares samples for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and saliva samples for antibody testing. We qualitatively assessed testing feasibility and adherence to stated camp infection mitigation strategies. Results: 76% (186/246) of eligible participants consented. The cohort completing both rounds of testing (n=163) comprised 67 campers, 76 household contacts, and 20 staff. Among those present, 100% of campers and staff completed test collection at both time points. Testing was feasible to implement, including staff participation supervising camper test collection. No virus was detected by RT-PCR; seven participants had antibodies. Observed adherence to stated camp mitigation policies for masking, physical distancing, and stable cohorting was generally high. Conclusions: Supervised, self-collected serial anterior nasal and saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 testing was acceptable, with successful repeated participation by children ages 5-14. This strategy for testing and the observed infection mitigation practices comprise potential core components for safe school reopening.",Peter B Cooch; Annalisa Watson; Apryl Olarte; Emily Dawn Crawford; - CLIAhub Consortium; Joe DeRisi; Bryan Greenhouse; Jill Hakim; Keirstinne Turcios; Lee Atkinson-McEvoy; Raphael Hirsch; Roberta L Keller; Theodore Ruel; Auritte Cohen-Ross; Araceli Leon; Naomi Bardach,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20214338,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20214338,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
6,"Associations between Affect, Physical Activity, and Anxiety Among US Children During COVID-19","We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID 19 pandemic. Sixty four typically developing children (63% girls) age 9 to 15 years old completed two virtual visits during height of stay at home measures between April 22 to July 29, 2020. Children completed 24 hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the shortened 10 item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important for child mental health during stressful periods.",Jasmin M Alves; Alexandra G Yunker; Alexis W Defendis; Anny H Xiang; Katie A Page,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216424,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216424,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
7,Prevalence of Depressive Disorders and Associated Demographic Factors Among Refugees Amidst COVID-19 in Nakivale Refugee Camp in Southwestern Uganda.,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic and health measures to prevent it have unprecedented effects on the mental health of the refugees. However, the situation of refugees in developing countries is unclear. Thus, this study estimated the prevalence of and associated demographic factors during COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology employed a cross-sectional survey carried out in June 2020 in which 146 adult refugees from Nakivale settlement camp were randomly selected to fill out a questionnaires-demographics and PHQ9. Results revealed that the majority of respondents were female (53%) and 47% had a depressive disorder. There was no statistical relationship between demographics (gender, age and marital status) and depressive disorders. In Conclusion, findings indicate that depressive disorders are prevalent among refugees in Nakivale settlement and it is important to identify refugees affected mentally and given proper treatment.",Lucas Goodgame Anyayo; Amir Kabunga,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216754,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216754,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
8,"Anti-vaccine attitudes and risk factors for not agreeing to vaccination against COVID-19 amongst 32,361 UK adults: Implications for public health communications","Background Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods Data were from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust or misinformation about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 22% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low income (< 30,000 GBP a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of vaccine benefit mistrust and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation Negative attitudes towards vaccines are major public health concerns in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns.

9,Mining transcriptomics and clinical data reveals ACE2 expression modulators and identifies cardiomyopathy as a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell-entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It plays critical roles in both the transmission and the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Comprehensive profiling of ACE2 expression patterns will help researchers to reveal risk factors of severe COVID-19 illness. While the expression of ACE2 in healthy human tissues has been well characterized, it is not known which diseases and drugs might modulate the ACE2 expression. In this study, we developed GENEVA (GENe Expression Variance Analysis), a semi-automated framework for exploring massive amounts of RNA-seq datasets. We applied GENEVA to 28,6650 publicly available RNA-seq samples to identify any previously studied experimental conditions that could directly or indirectly modulate ACE2 expression. We identified multiple drugs, genetic perturbations, and diseases that modulate the expression of ACE2, including cardiomyopathy, HNF1A overexpression, and drug treatments with RAD140 and Itraconazole. Our unbiased meta-analysis of seven datasets confirms ACE2 up-regulation in all cardiomyopathy categories. Using electronic health records data from 3936 COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that patients with pre-existing cardiomyopathy have an increased mortality risk than age-matched patients with other cardiovascular conditions.

10,Evidence for secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in COVID-19,"The causes of coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 disease are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between markers of endothelial activation, intravascular hemolysis, coagulation, and organ damage in COVID-19 patients and study their association with disease severity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective study of 181 hospitalized COVID-19 patients randomly selected with equal distribution of survivors and non-survivors. Patients who died had significantly lower ADAMTS13 activity, significantly higher LDH, schistocytes and von Willebrand Factor levels compared to patients discharged alive. Only 30% of patients with an initial ADAMTS13 activity <43% survived vs. 60% with ADAMTS13 >43% who survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 may manifest as a TMA-like illness in a subset of hospitalized patients. Presence of schistocytes on admission may warrant a work-up for TMA. These findings indicate the need for future investigation to study the relationship between endothelial and coagulation activation and the efficacy of TMA treatments in COVID-19.",Joseph Sweeney; Mohammad Barouqa; Gregory J J Krause; Jesus Gonzalez Lugo; Shafia Rahman; Morayma Reyes Gil,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215608,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215608,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
11,Broadly-targeted autoreactivity is common in severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to the presence of autoantibodies against multiple targets, including phospholipids and type-I interferons. We recently identified activation of an autoimmune-prone B cell response pathway as correlate of severe COVID-19, raising the possibility of de novo autoreactive antibody production during the antiviral response. Here, we identify autoreactive antibodies as a common feature of severe COVID-19, identifying biomarkers of tolerance breaks that may indicate aggressive immunomodulation.",Matthew Woodruff; Richard P Ramonell; F.

12,Clinical correlations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19 infection,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the clinical correlations of antibodies produced by infected individuals will be critical for incorporating antibody results into clinical management. This study was an observational cohort study to evaluate antibody responses in individuals with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, including 48 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a large tertiary care medical center. Serum samples were obtained from patients at various time points during the disease course and tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Medical records were reviewed, and antibody levels were compared with clinical and laboratory findings. Patients did not have high levels of antibodies within one week of symptoms, but most had detectable IgM and IgG antibodies between 8 and 29 days after onset of symptoms. Some individuals did not develop measurable levels of IgM or IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies were associated with elevated ALT, but there were no other significant associations. We did not observe significant associations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with clinical outcomes, including intubation and death. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were unlikely to be detected in the first week of infection or in severely immunocompromised individuals. Although we did not observe associations with clinical outcomes, IgM antibodies were associated with higher ALT levels. Antibody production reflects the virus-specific immune response, which is important for immunity but also drives pathology, and antibody levels may be important for guiding treatment of individuals with COVID-19.",Mia DeSimone; Daimon P Simmons; Nicole Tolan; Stacy Melanson; Athena Petrides; Milenko Tanasijevic; Peter Schur,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20213207,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20213207,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
13,Tocilizumab in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is often associated with hyperinflammation. Safety and efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab was evaluated in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia. Methods: Nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia were randomized (2:1) to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations were emphasized. The primary endpoint was cumulative proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28. Results: Of 389 randomized patients, 249 patients received tocilizumab and 128 received placebo in the modified intent-to-treat population (Hispanic/Latino, 56.0%; Black/African American, 14.9%; American Indian/Alaska Native, 12.7%; White, 12.7%; other/unknown, 3.7%). The cumulative proportion (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28 was 12.0% (8.52% to 16.86%) and 19.3 % (13.34% to 27.36%) for the tocilizumab and placebo arms, respectively (log-rank P=0.0360; hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97]). Median time to clinical failure up to Day 28 favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93]). All-cause mortality by Day 28 was 10.4% with tocilizumab and 8.6% with placebo (weighted difference, 2.0% [95% CI, -5.2% to 7.8%). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 15.2% of tocilizumab patients (38/250 patients) and 19.7% of placebo patients (25/127). Conclusions: This trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab over placebo in reducing the likelihood of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation or death in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.",Carlos Salama; Jian Han; Linda Yau; William G.

14,"Early use of nitazoxanide in mild Covid-19 disease: randomized, placebo-controlled trial","The antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide is widely available and exerts broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro. However, there is no evidence of its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients who presented up to 3 days after onset of Covid-19 symptoms (dry cough, fever, and/or fatigue) were enrolled. After confirmation of SARS-CoV2 infection by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either nitazoxanide (500 mg) or placebo, TID, for 5 days. The primary outcome was complete resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were viral load, general laboratory tests, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and hospitalization rate. Adverse events were also assessed. From June 8 to August 20, 2020, 1,575 patients were screened. Of these, 392 (198 placebo, 194 nitazoxanide) were analyzed. Median time from symptom onset to first dose of study drug was 5 (4-5) days. At the 5-day study visit, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo arms. However, at the 1-week follow-up, 78% in the nitazoxanide arm and 57% in the placebo arm reported complete resolution of symptoms (p=0.048). Swabs collected were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in 29.9% of patients in the nitazoxanide arm versus 18.2% in the placebo arm (p=0.009). Viral load was also reduced after nitazoxanide compared to placebo (p=0.006). No serious adverse events were observed.

15,Decrease in Hospitalizations for COVID-19 after Mask Mandates in 1083 U.S. Counties,"Importance: Population-wide facial masking decreases COVID-19 transmission but may also decrease the severity of disease by reducing the viral inoculum to which the wearer is exposed. The mortality of COVID-19 infection decreased in the U.S. in the second wave over the summer of 2020 compared to the first, but reasons for declining severity of disease have not been fully elucidated. Objective: To determine if facial mask mandates instituted in U.S. counties over the spring and summer of 2020 were associated with declining severity of infection as measured by the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19. Design: Data on hospitalizations due to COVID-19; testing access determined by number of tests performed per day per 100,000 people; new cases per day normalized by population; measures of population mobility to control for other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, social distancing, and business closures; age categories in each census tract; and dates of masking mandates in U.S. counties were all obtained from open-sourced epidemiologic datasets. We used a staggered difference-in-difference study design to assess the impact of the introduction of mask mandates (defined as the treatment) on the proportion of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 per week from March 10-September 16, 2020. Setting: U.S. counties with available full datasets on relevant COVID-19 metrics Exposure: Mask mandates Main outcome: Proportion of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 Results: Using data from 1083 counties (34% of U.S. counties, 82% of U.S. population) from 49 states, we found a statistically significant drop in hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 up to 12 weeks following county mask mandates of 7.13 (95% CI: -4.19, -10.1) percentage points, after controlling for age categories by county, testing access, numbers of cases, and population mobility. Conclusion and Relevance: Facial masking may decrease COVID-19 severity by decreasing the viral inoculum to which individuals are exposed. Mask mandates across 1083 counties in the U.S. in 49 states decreased hospitalization rates from COVID-19 even when controlling for other factors that could impact disease severity, including age, testing access, number of cases, and mobility (as a proxy for other non-Pharmaceutical interventions such as sheltering-in-place).

16,Serological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2: trends and humoral response in a cohort of public health workers,"Background There is considerable debate about the rate of antibody waning after SARS-CoV-2 infection, raising questions around long-term immunity following both natural infection and vaccination. We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England. Methods The serosurveillance cohort included office and laboratory-based staff and healthcare workers in 4 sites in England, who were tested monthly for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein IgG between 23rd March and 20th August 2020. Antibody levels from 21 days after a positive test were modelled using mixed effects regression models. Findings In total, 2247 individuals were recruited and 2014 (90%) had 3-5 monthly antibody tests. Overall, 272 (12.1%) of individuals had at least one positive/equivocal spike protein IgG result, with the highest proportion in a hospital site (22%), 14% in London and 2.1% in a rural area. Results were similar for nucleoprotein IgG. Following a positive result, 39/587 (6.6%) tested negative for nucleoprotein IgG and 52/515 (10.1%) for spike protein IgG. Nucleoprotein IgG declined by 6.4% per week (95% CI, 5.5-7.4%; half-life, 75 [95% CI, 66-89] days) and spike protein IgG by 5.8% (95% CI, 5.1-6.6%; half-life, 83 [95% CI, 73-96] days). Conclusions Over the study period SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 8-10% overall and up to 21% in clinical healthcare workers. In seropositive individuals, nucleoprotein and spike protein IgG antibodies declined with time after infection and 50% are predicted to fall below the positive test threshold after 6 months.",Ross J Harris; Heather J Whitaker; Nick J Andrews; Felicity Aiano; Zahin Amin-Chowdhury; Jessica Flood; Ray Borrow; Ezra Linley; Shazaad Ahmad; Lorraine Stapley; Bassam Hallis; Gayatri Amirthalingam; Ben Parker; Alex Horsley; Timothy J G Brooks; Kevin Brown; Mary Ramsay; Shamez Ladhani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216689,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216689,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
17,Comparison of three nasopharyngeal swab types and the impact of physiochemical properties for optimal SARS-CoV-2 detection,"Adequate swab specimen collection, release and detection of nucleic acids by molecular diagnostic assays is largely attributed to the physical and chemical characteristics of different swab types. We investigated properties of three types of commercial nasopharyngeal swabs (nylon flocked: Type 1-Media Merge; Type 2- Kang Jian Medical Apparatus, China and Type 3- Wuxi NEST Biotechnology Co. Ltd, China) used in clinical diagnostics with the aim to establish if different swab designs and configurations had any effect on swab performance. Properties investigated included viral absorption, release, capture, extraction and recovery efficiency from each swab for the detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). All swab types (n=18) were inoculated with different amounts of SARS-CoV-2 live viral cultures (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 copies/ml) and eluted in sterile phosphate buffer saline. RNA was extracted from all swab eluates using a fully automated system (BD MAX System) and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. RNA stability was also investigated after dry storage of swabs at room temperature for 72 hours. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed in the absorption and release capabilities between Type 1 and 3 as well as between Type 2 and 3 swabs, however, no significant difference was observed between Type 1 and 2. Ct values and extraction efficiency amounts of SARS-CoV-2 varied amongst the swab types. We conclude that in order to facilitate accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, assessment of NP swab characteristics is of importance before implementation for specimen collection in the clinical setting.",Trish R Kahamba; Lara Noble; Lesley Scott; Wendy Stevens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20206078,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20206078,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
18,Survey of Attitudes on Personal Protection Interventions Against COVID-19 Including MMR Vaccination and Future Anti-COVID Vaccines,"Abstract: An electronic survey was conducted in October, 2020 among individuals primarily age 60 and older regarding their degree of confidence of deriving personal protection from 8 different antiCOVID interventions: social isolation, lockdowns, avoiding restaurants, taking MMR vaccine, wearing masks when indoors with others, avoiding hotels, avoiding commercial air travel, and using the first future specific antiCOVID vaccine. Responses were received from 135 persons from many different U.S. regions and 5 foreign countries. Respondents were generally individuals with very high levels of education and personal achievement. Results demonstrated wide diversity of responses regarding each of these interventions. None were strongly supported by a majority of respondents, but those receiving the largest proportions of strong support were social isolation (41%), wearing masks indoors (41%), and using the first antiCOVID vaccine (41%). MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination was viewed much more positively than negatively but had the highest proportion of individuals who felt they had insufficient data to formulate an opinion. The largest number of strong negative assessments were toward lockdowns (37%). We speculate that the wide variation in perception of possible benefits from the surveyed interventions, most of which have been widely practiced by or imposed upon millions of individuals, in this highly accomplished older population at increased personal risk from COVID19 reflects the current absence of rigorous scientific proof of the efficacy of any these interventions, and the continuation of the epidemic despite the widespread utilization of most of them.",Joseph D.

19,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in two regions of Estonia (KoroSero-EST-1),"Background: In Estonia, during the first wave of COVID-19 total number of cases confirmed by PCR was 13.3/10,000, similar in most regions, including capital Tallinn, but in the hotspot of Estonian epidemic, an island Saaremaa, the cumulative incidence was 166.1/10,000. Aim: We aimed to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in these two regions, symptoms associated with infection and factors associated with antibody concentrations. Methods: Participants were selected using stratified (formed by age decades) random sampling and recruited by general practitioners. IgG were determined from sera by four assays. Symptoms of acute respiratory illness associated with seropositivity were analyzed by multiple correspondence analysis, antibody concentrations by multiple linear regression. Results: Total of 3608 individual were invited and 1960 recruited From May 8 to July 31, 2020. Seroprevalence was 1.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-2.5) and 6.3% (95% CI 5.0-7.9), infection fatality rate 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.2) and 1.3% (95% CI 0.4-2.1) in Tallinn and Saaremaa, respectively. Of seropositive subjects 19.2% (14/73) had acute respiratory illness. Fever, diarrhea and the absence of cough and runny nose were associated with seropositivity in individuals aged 50 or more years. IgG concentrations were higher if fever, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain or diarrhea was present, or hospitalization required. Conclusion: Similarly to other European countries the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Estonia was low even in the hotspot region Saaremaa suggesting that majority of population is still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

20,Superspreading Events Without Superspreaders: Using High Attack Rate Events to Estimate N o forAirborne Transmission of COVID-19,"We study transmission of COVID-19 using five well-documented case studies : a Washington state church choir, a Korean call center, a Korean exercise class, and two different Chinese bus trips. In all cases the likely index patients were pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic, which is when infective patients are most likely to interact with large groups of people. An estimate of N 0 , the characteristic number of COVID-19 virions needed to induce infection in each case, is found using a simple physical model of airborne transmission. We find that the N 0 values are similar for five COVID-19 superspreading cases (~300-2,000 viral copies) and of the same order as influenza A. Consistent with the recent results of Goyal et al , these results suggest that viral loads relevant to infection from presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals may fall into a narrow range, and that exceptionally high viral loads are not required to induce a superspreading event [1,2] . Rather, t he accumulation of infective aerosols exhaled by a typical pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient in a confined, crowdedspace (amplified by poor ventilation, particularly activity like exercise or singing, or lack of masks) for exposure times as short as one hour are sufficient. We calculate that talking and breathing release ~460 N 0 and ~10 N 0 (quanta)/hour, respectively, providing a basis to estimate the risks of everyday activities. Finally, we provide a calculation which motivates the observation that fomites appear to account for a smallpercentage of total COVID-19 infection events.",MARA G. PRENTISS; Arthur Chu; Karl K.

21,Viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the predictive value of repeat testing,"SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that report viral RNA concentrations can be used to determine a patient's stage of infection, but this potential has not yet been realized due to a lack of prospective longitudinal data to calibrate such inferences. Here, we report the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals using quantitative PCR testing. On average, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals reached similar peak viral RNA concentrations (22.2 Ct, 95% credible interval [19.1, 25.1] vs. 22.4 Ct [20.2, 24.5]) within similar amounts of time (2.9 days [0.7, 4.7] vs. 3.0 days [1.3, 4.3]), but acute shedding lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.5 days [6.5, 14.0] vs. 6.7 days [3.2, 9.2]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR result reliably indicated whether viral RNA concentration was increasing, decreasing, or in a low-level persistent phase.

In this article, we are going to analyze the current COVID-19 spread patterns in Italy, the UK, Germany, Russia, Spain and France. We have found that the current spread has perhaps been underestimated as just the second wave. As per our analysis, as on 7 October the resurgence is much more vigorous than the first wave of spread of the disease.

23,"No lockdown policy for COVID-19 epidemic in Bangladesh: Good, bad or ugly?","Bangladesh has been combating the COVID-19 pandemic with limited financial resources and poor health infrastructure since March, 2020. Although the government has imposed several restricted measures to curb the progression of the outbreak, these arrays of measures are not sustainable in the long run. In this study, we assess the impact of lift of flexible lockdown on the COVID-19 dynamics in Bangladesh. Our analysis demonstrates that the country might experience second infection peak in 6-7 months after the withdrawal of current lockdown. Moreover, a prolonged restriction until January, 2021 will shift the infection peak towards August, 2021 and will reduce approximately 20 % COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh.",Zakaria Shams Siam; M.

24,Prediction of the infection of COVID-19 in Bangladesh by classical SIR model,"The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) started from Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019. It is one of the leading public health challenges in the world because of high transmissibility. The first patient of COVID-19 was officially reported on March 8, 2020, in Bangladesh. Using the epidemiological data up to October 17, 2020, we try to estimate the infectious size. In this paper, we used Classical SIR (Susceptible- Infected-Recovered), model. The epidemic has now spread to more than 216 countries around the world. The necessary reproduction number R_o of Bangladesh is 1.92. The primary data was collected from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard (BANGLADESH: CASE TREND). In our analysis, the statistical parameters specify the best import to provide the predicted result. We projected that the epidemic curve pulling down in Bangladesh will start from the first week of November (November 4, 2020) and may end in the last week of July (July 24, 2021). It is also estimated that the start of acceleration on May 24, 2020, in 53 days, and the start of steady growth on September 10, 2020, in 109 days. The start of the ending phase of the epidemic may appear in the first week of November 2020, and the epidemic is expected to be finished by the last week of July 2021.

25,Patterns of Multimorbidity and Risk of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection: an observational study in the U.K.,"Background Pre-existing comorbidities have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection but evidence is sparse on the importance and pattern of multimorbidity (2 or more conditions) and severity of infection indicated by hospitalisation or mortality. We aimed to use a multimorbidity index developed specifically for COVID-19 to investigate the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We used data from the UK Biobank linked to laboratory confirmed test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality data from Public Health England between March 16 and July 26, 2020. By reviewing the current literature on COVID-19 we derived a multimorbidity index including: 1) angina; 2) asthma; 3) atrial fibrillation; 4) cancer; 5) chronic kidney disease; 6) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 7) diabetes mellitus; 8) heart failure; 9) hypertension; 10) myocardial infarction; 11) peripheral vascular disease; 12) stroke. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalisation or death). Potential effect modifiers of the association were assessed: age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, body mass index, air pollution, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, cardiorespiratory fitness, high sensitivity C-reactive protein. Results Among 360,283 participants, the median age was 68 [range, 48-85] years, most were White (94.5%), and 1,706 had severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of multimorbidity was more than double in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (25%) compared to those without (11%), and clusters of several multimorbidities were more common in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common clusters with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were stroke with hypertension (79% of those with stroke had hypertension); diabetes and hypertension (72%); and chronic kidney disease and hypertension (68%). Multimorbidity was independently associated with a greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.91 [95% confidence interval 1.70, 2.15] compared to no multimorbidity). The risk remained consistent across potential effect modifiers, except for greater risk among men.

26,The impact of COVID-19 on Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) of an Italian Province: a cohort study and a retrospective analysis of observed vs. expected mortality,"In Italy, as in other countries, Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) have seen a disproportionally high number of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Veneto region was one of the first areas of the country where the virus spread rapidly particularly in the LTCFs. As it became evident that LTCs were the epicenter of the pandemic, health authorities of the Vicenza province adopted a plan, which included an epidemiological investigation in a case study facility (CSF) and a retrospective analysis to estimate the impact of COVID-19 in terms of mortality. Combining retrospective data and a prospective cohort study in the CSF we provided a tentative estimate of the impact of COVID-19 on LTCFs. We found an age-gradient in all variables explored. An observed mortality higher 60% than 2019 was found in those LTCF reporting COVID-19 cases.

27,Trends in suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in a major German city,"Background It remains unclear whether the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates. Social distancing, economic insecurity and increasing prevalence rates of mental disorders may cause an increase in risk factors for suicide. Methods Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations in suicide risk, data from 2020 were compared to data from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes A total of 333 suicides were registered and 2,791,131 life years (LY) were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 42 suicides and 300,834 LY accounted for the year 2020. In 2020, suicide rates (SR, suicides per 100,000 LY) were lower in periods with moderate (SR = 8.5, X^2 = 4.374, p = 0.037) or severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.0, X^2 = 3.999, p = 0.046) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 18.0). A comparison with preceding years showed that differences cannot be attributed to seasonal variations. No age- or gender differences were found. Interpretation SR decreased during the COVID-19 restrictions; we expect SR to rise in the medium term. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is therefore urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalized.

28,Modelling the Anatomical Distribution of Neurological Events in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review,"Background Neuropathology caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported across several studies. The characterisation of the spatial distribution of these pathology remains critical to assess long and short-term neurological sequelae of COVID-19. To this end, Mathematical models can be used to characterise the location and aetiologies underlying COVID-19-related neuropathology. Method We performed a systematic review of the literature to quantify the locations of small neurological events identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among COVID-19 patients. Neurological events were localised into the Desikan-Killiany grey and white matter atlases. A mathematical network diffusion model was then used to test whether the spatial distribution of neurological events could be explained via a linear spread through the structural connectome of the brain. Findings We identified 35 articles consisting of 123 patients that assessed the spatial distribution of small neurological events among COVID-19 patients. Of these, 91 patients had grey matter changes, 95 patients had white matter changes and 72 patients had confirmed cerebral microbleeds. White matter events were observed within 14 of 42 white matter bundles from the IIT atlas. The highest proportions (26%) of events were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. The splenium and middle of the corpus callosum were affected in 14% and 9% of the cases respectively. Grey matter events were spatially distributed in the 41 brain regions within the Desikan-Killiany atlas. The highest proportions (~10%) of the events were observed in areas including the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices. Sub-cortical events were most frequently identified in the Pallidum. The application of a mathematical network diffusion model suggested that the spatial pattern of the small neurological events in COVID-19 can be modelled with a linear diffusion of spread from epicentres in the bilateral cerebellum and basal ganglia (Pearsons r=0.41, p<0.001, corrected). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically characterise the spatial distribution of small neurological events in COVID-19 patients and test whether the spatial distribution of these events can be explained by a linear diffusion spread model. The location of neurological events is consistent with commonly identified neurological symptoms including alterations in conscious state among COVID-19 patients that require brain imaging. Given the prevalence and severity of these manifestations, clinicians should carefully monitor neurological symptoms within COVID-19 patients and their potential long-term sequelae.",Nicholas Parsons; Athanasia Outsikas; Annie Parish; Rebecca Clohesy; Nilam Thakkar; Fiore Fiore DAprano; Fidel Toomey; Shailesh Advani; Govinda Raj Poudel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20215640,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20215640,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True

This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence on COVID-19 patients with HBV or HCV co-infections. Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases and preprint servers from December 1, 2019 to August 9, 2020. Studies were included if they reported quantitative empirical data on COVID- 19 patients with HBV or HCV co-infections. Descriptive analyses were reported and data were narratively synthesized. Quality assessments was completed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Results: Out of the 941 identified records, 28 studies were included. Of the eligible studies, 235 patients with COVID-19 were infected with HBV and 22 patients with HCV. Most patients were male and mean age was 49.8 and 62.8 in patients with HBV and HCV, respectively. Death proportion was 6% among COVID-19-HBV and 13% among COVID-19-HCV co-infected patients. Among COVID-19 patients, 34.1% and 76.2% reported at least one comorbidity besides HBV and HCV infections, mainly hypertension and diabetes mellites type 2. The most common COVID-19-related symptoms in both HBV and HCV groups were fever, cough and dyspnea. ICU admission was reported in 14.1% and 21.4% of individuals with HBV and HCV, respectively.

30,Nasopharyngeal aspirates vs. nasal swabs for the detection of respiratory pathogens: results of a rapid review protocol,"Background Nasal pathogen detection sensitivities are often as low as 70% despite advances in molecular diagnostics. It has been suggested that this is linked, in part, to the choice of sampling method. Methods A diagnostic test accuracy review for sensitivity, using recently developed Cochrane methods for conducting rapid reviews, and the PRISMA protocol was undertaken, with QUADAS-2 risk of bias assessments and meta-analysis of included studies. Sensitivities were calculated by a consensus standard of positivity by either method as the gold standard. Insufficient and/or inaccurate, cross sectional or anatomical site pooling methodologies were excluded. Results Of 13 included studies, 8 had high risk of bias, and 5 had high applicability concerns. There were no statistical differences in pooled sensitivities between collection methods for 8 different viruses, and neither with use of PCR, Immunofluorescence nor culture. In a single study, Influenza H1N1 favoured nasopharyngeal swabs, with aspirates having 93.3% of the sensitivity of swabs (p>0.001). Similar equivocal sensitivities were noticed in detecting bacteria. Conclusions The chain of sampling, from anatomical site to laboratory results, features different potential foci along which sensitivity may be lost. A sufficient body of evidence exists that use of a different sampling method will not yield more respiratory pathogens.

31,The wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric complications in Covid-19 patients within a multidisciplinary hospital context,"Objective: To describe the spectrum of neurological and psychiatric complications in patients with Covid-19 seen in a multidisciplinary center over six months. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study on all patients showing neurological or psychiatric symptoms in the context of Covid-19 seen in the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry of the APHP-Sorbonne University. We collected demographic data, medical and treatment history, comorbidities, symptoms, date of onset, and severity of Covid-19 infection, neurological and psychiatric symptoms, neurological and psychiatric examination data and, when available, results from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, brain magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging, 18-fluorodesoxyglucose-position emission computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT)), electroencephalography (EEG) and electroneuromyography (ENMG). Results: 245 patients were included in the analysis. One-hundred fourteen patients (47%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 10 (4%) died. The most frequently reported neuropsychiatric symptoms were motor deficit (41%), cognitive disturbance (35%), impaired consciousness (26%), psychiatric disturbance (24%), headache (20%) and behavioral disturbance (18%). The most frequent syndromes diagnosed were encephalopathy (43%), critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (26%), isolated psychiatric disturbance (18%), and cerebrovascular disorders (16%). No patients showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in their CSF. Encephalopathy was associated with greater age and higher risk of death.

32,The incubation period of COVID-19: A scoping review and meta-analysis to aid modelling and planning,"Background An accurate estimate of the distribution of the incubation period for COVID-19 is the foundational building block for modelling the spread of the SARS COV2 and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies on affected communities. Initial estimates were based on early infections, the aim of this study was to provide an updated estimate and meta-analysis of the incubation period distribution for COVID-19. Methods The review was conducted according to the PRISMA Scoping Review guidelines. Five databases were searched; CINAHL, MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, ASSIA, and Global Index Medicus for studies published between 1 January 2020 - 27 July 2020. Results A total of 1,084 articles were identified through the database searches and 1 article was identified through the reference screening of retrieved articles. After screening 64 articles were included. The studies combined had a sample of 45,151 people. The mean of the incubation periods was 6.71 days with 95% CIs ranging from 1 to 12.4 days. The median was 6 days and IQR ranging from 1.8 to 16.3. The resulting parameters for a Gamma Distribution modelling the incubation period were {Gamma}(,{lambda})={Gamma}(2.810,0.419) with mean, =/{lambda}. Conclusion Governments are planning their strategies on a maximum incubation period of 14 days. While our results are limited to primarily Chinese research studies, the findings highlight the variability in the mean period and the potential for further incubation beyond 14 days. There is an ongoing need for detailed surveillance on the timing of self-isolation periods and related measures protecting communities as incubation periods may be longer.",Prakashini Banka; Catherine M Comiskey,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216143,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,True
33,Diagnostic utility of a Ferritin-to-Procalcitonin Ratio to differentiate patients with COVID-19 from those with Bacterial Pneumonia: A multicenter study,"Importance: There is a need to develop tools to differentiate COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia at the time of clinical presentation before diagnostic testing is available. Objective: To determine if the Ferritin-to-Procalcitonin ratio (F/P) can be used to differentiate COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia. Design: This case-control study compared patients with either COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia, admitted between March 1 and May 31, 2020. Patients with COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia co-infection were excluded. Setting: A multicenter study conducted at three hospitals that included UCHealth and Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in the United States, and Yichang Central People Hospital in China. Participants: A total of 242 cases with COVID-19 infection and 34 controls with bacterial pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures: The F/P in patients with COVID-19 or with bacterial pneumonia were compared. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined the sensitivity and specificity of various cut-off F/P values for the diagnosis of COVID-19 versus bacterial pneumonia. Results: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a lower mean age (57.11 vs 64.4 years, p=0.02) and a higher BMI (30.74 vs 27.15 kg/m2, p=0.02) compared to patients with bacterial pneumonia. Cases and controls had a similar proportion of women (47% vs 53%, p=0.5) and COVID-19 patients had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (32.6% vs 12%, p=0.01). The median F/P was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (4037.5) compared to the F/P in bacterial pneumonia (802, p<0.001). An F/P greater than or equal to 877 used to diagnose COVID-19 resulted in a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 56%, with a positive predictive value of 93.2%, and a likelihood ratio of 1.92. In multivariable analyses, an F/P greater than or equal to 877 was associated with greater odds of identifying a COVID-19 case (OR: 11.27, CI: 4-31.2, p<0.001). Conclusions and Relevance: An F/P greater than or equal to 877 increases the likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia compared to bacterial pneumonia. Further research is needed to determine if obtaining ferritin and procalcitonin simultaneously at the time of clinical presentation has improved diagnostic value. Additional questions include whether an increased F/P and/or serial F/P associates with COVID-19 disease severity or outcomes.",Amal A. Gharamti; Fei Mei; Katherine C.

34,Population-based prevalence surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"Population-based prevalence surveys of COVID-19 contribute to establish the burden and epidemiology of infection, the role of asymptomatic and mild infections in transmission, and allow more precise decisions about reopen policies. We performed a systematic review to evaluate qualitative aspects of these studies, their reliability, and biases. The available data described 37 surveys from 19 countries, mostly from Europe and America and using antibody testing. They reached highly heterogeneous sample sizes and prevalence estimates. Disproportional prevalence was observed in minority communities. Important risk of bias was detected in four domains: sample size, data analysis with sufficient coverage, measurements in standard way, and response rate. The correspondence analysis showed few consistent patterns for high risk of bias. Intermediate risk of bias was related to American and European studies, blood samples and prevalence >1%. Low risk of bias was related to Asian studies, RT-PCR tests and prevalence <1%.",Vinicius Bonetti Franceschi Jr.; Andressa Schneiders Santos Jr.; Andressa Barreto Glaeser Jr.; Janini Cristina Paiz Jr.; Gabriel Dickin Caldana Jr.; Carem Luana Machado Lessa Jr.; Amanda de Menezes Mayer Jr.; Julia Goncalves Kuchle Jr.; Paulo Ricardo Gazzola Zen Sr.; Alvaro Vigo Sr.; Ana Trindade Winck Sr.; Liane Nanci Rotta Sr.; Claudia Elizabeth Thompson Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216259,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216259,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,True
35,COVID-19's unfortunate events in schools: mitigating classroom clusters in the context of variable transmission,"Widespread school closures occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened schools with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools were low risk and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We describe the contrasting literature on school transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by heterogeneity, or ``overdispersion'' in transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in children and youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic individual-based model to find the implications of these combined observations for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider both individual and environment/activity contributions to the transmission rate, as both are known to contribute to variability in transmission. We find that even small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly variable transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols we modeled, initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic individual, are able to prevent large transmission clusters unless the transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters do not occur in any case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring (for example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention. We suggest approaches and the rationale for mitigating these ``unfortunate events'', even if they are expected to be rare.",Paul Tupper; Caroline Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216267,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216267,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,True
36,Prevalence of COVID-19 in Adolescents and Youth Compared with Older Adults in States Experiencing Surges,"PURPOSE: There has been considerable controversy regarding susceptibility of adolescents (10-19 years) and youth (15-24 years) to COVID-19. A number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases. METHODS: We examined data from six U.S. states experiencing surges in the number of cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two other measures, related to prevalence in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures were: Percentage of cases observed in a given age group / by the percentage of cases expected based on population demographics; and percentage deviation, or [(% observed- % expected)/ % expected] x100. RESULTS: Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p<.00001), as was percentage observed / percentage expected (p<.005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p<0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. The findings have implications for school re-openings. The age groups 10-19 and 15-24 are students in middle school, high school, college, and the first two years of professional/graduate school. The high prevalence in these age groups would argue against school re-openings in the near future.",Barbara T Rumain; Moshe Schneiderman; Allan Geliebter,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215541,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215541,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,True

38,Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a structure reveals chloride binding sites,"SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a is believed to form ion channels, which may be involved in the modulation of virus release, and has been implicated in various cellular processes like the up-regulation of fibrinogen expression in lung epithelial cells, downregulation of type 1 interferon receptor, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and increasing IFNAR1 ubiquitination. ORF3a assemblies as homotetramers, which are stabilized by residue C133. A recent cryoEM structure of a homodimeric complex of ORF3a has been released. A lower-resolution cryoEM map of the tetramer suggests two dimers form it, arranged side by side. The dimer's cryoEM structure revealed that each protomer contains three transmembrane helices arranged in a clockwise configuration forming a six helices transmembrane domain. This domain's potential permeation pathway has six constrictions narrowing to about 0.1 nm in radius, suggesting the structure solved is in a closed or inactivated state. At the cytosol end, the permeation pathway encounters a large and polar cavity formed by multiple beta strands from both protomers, which opens to the cytosolic milieu. We modeled the tetramer following the arrangement suggested by the low-resolution tetramer cryoEM map. Molecular dynamics simulations of the tetramer embedded in a membrane and solvated with 0.5 M of KCl were performed. Our simulations show the cytosolic cavity is quickly populated by both K+ and Cl-, yet with different dynamics. K+ ions moved relatively free inside the cavity without forming proper coordination sites. In contrast, Cl- ions enter the cavity, and three of them can become stably coordinated near the intracellular entrance of the potential permeation pathway by an inter-subunit network of positively charged amino acids. Consequently, the central cavity's electrostatic potential changed from being entirely positive at the beginning of the simulation to more electronegative at the end.",Valeria Marquez-Miranda; Maximiliano Rojas; Yorley Duarte; Ignacio Diaz-Franulic; Miguel Holmgren; Raul Cachau; Fernando Danilo Gonzalez-Nilo,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.349522,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.349522,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,False
39,Immunogenicity of a new gorilla adenovirus vaccine candidate for COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the emergent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public health and there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective vaccines. Here we report the generation and the preclinical evaluation of a novel replication-defective gorilla adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV2. We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAd-COV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies which neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, Th1-dominated cellular response in the periphery and in the lung. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies. To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at massive scale, different GRAd genome deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank bioreactors. This preliminary dataset identified GRAd-COV2 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate, supporting the translation of GRAd-COV2 vaccine in a currently ongoing Phase I clinical trial (NCT04528641).",Alessandra Vitelli Sr.; Stefania Capone Sr.; Angelo Raggioli; Michela Gentile; Simone Battella; Armin Lahm; Andrea Sommella; Alessandra Maria Contino; Richard A Urbanowicz; Romina Scala; Federica Barra; Adriano Leuzzi; Eleonora Lilli; Giuseppina Miselli; Alessia Noto; Maria Ferraiuolo; Francesco Talotta; Theocharis Tsoleridis; Silvia Meschi; Marco Soriani; Antonella Folgori; Jonathan K Ball; Stefano Colloca,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.349951,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.349951,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,False
40,Distinct Phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 Isolates Reveal Viral Traits Critical for Replication in Primary Human Respiratory Cells,"Since entering the human population, SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) has spread across the world, causing >40 million infections and >1 million deaths. While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether these changes impact adaptation, replication or transmission of the virus in its new host. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all the major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, viral stocks and passaging experiments, with kinetic virus replication data from non-human Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 sequence features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally-occurring substitutions in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G substitution generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E, and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin-cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human respiratory cells.

41,Broad transcriptional dysregulation of brain and choroid plexus cell types with COVID-19,"Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity. However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons--evolutionarily expanded in humans--show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive function, schizophrenia, and depression.

42,Small-Molecule In Vitro Inhibitors of the Coronavirus Spike - ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction as Blockers of Viral Attachment and Entry for SARS-CoV-2,"Inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2, which acts as a ligand-receptor pair that initiates the viral attachment and cellular entry of this coronavirus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are of considerable interest as potential antiviral agents. While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable / less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound-library that is focused on the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel drug-like compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50s of 0.2-3.0 M); whereas, control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not ACE2. Selected promising compounds inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells in concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50s (6-30 M). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for coronavirus attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.",Damir Bojadzic; Oscar Alcazar; Jinshui Chen; Peter Buchwald,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.351056,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.351056,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,False
43,Deep learning segmentation model for automated detection of the opacity regions in the chest X-rays of the Covid-19 positive patients and the application for disease severity,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe pandemic of Covid-19 has caused tremendous losses to lives and economy in the entire world. Up until October 2020, it has caused more than 38 million infections and 1.1 million deaths. This has created a severe burden for the health care system worldwide. The machine learning models have been applied to the radiological images of the Covid-19 positive patients for disease prediction and severity assessment. However, a segmentation model for detecting the opacity regions like haziness, ground-glass opacity and lung consolidation from the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays is still lacking. The recently published dataset of a collection of radiological images for a rural population in United States had made development of such a model a possibility due to the high quality of the radiological images and the consistency in clinical measurements. We manually annotated 221 chest X-ray images with lung fields and opacity regions and trained a segmentation model for the opacity region. The model has a good performance in regarding the overlap between predicted and manually labelled opacity regions for both the testing data set and the validation dataset from very different sources. In addition, the percentage of the opacity region over the area of the total lung fields shows a good predictive power for the patient severity. In view of the above, our model is a successful first try in developing a segmentation model for the opacity regions for the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays. However, careful manual examinations of the model predictions by experienced radiologists show mistakenly predicted opacity regions caused probably by the anatomical complexities. Thus, additional work is needed before a robust and accurate model can be developed for the ultimate goal of implementation in the clinical setting.

44,Early prognostication of COVID-19 to guide hospitalisation versus outpatient monitoring using a point-of-test risk prediction score,"Introduction Risk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are defined but stratification of mortality using non-laboratory measured scores, particularly at the time of pre-hospital SARS-CoV-2 testing, is lacking. Methods Multivariate regression with bootstrapping was used to identify independent mortality predictors in a derivation cohort of COVID-19 patients. Predictions were externally validated in a large random sample of the ISARIC cohort (N=14,231) and a smaller cohort from Aintree (N=290). Results 983 patients (median age 70, IQR 53-83; in-hospital mortality 29.9%) were recruited over an 11-week study period. Through sequential modelling, a 5-predictor score termed SOARS (SpO2, Obesity, Age, Respiratory rate, Stroke history) was developed to correlate COVID-19 severity across low, moderate and high strata of mortality risk. The score discriminated well for in-hospital death, with area under the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.82, 0.80 and 0.74 in the derivation, Aintree and ISARIC validation cohorts respectively. Its predictive accuracy (calibration) in both external cohorts was consistently higher in patients with milder disease (SOARS 0-1), the same individuals who could be identified for safe outpatient monitoring. Prediction of a non-fatal outcome in this group was accompanied by high score sensitivity (99.2%) and negative predictive value (95.9%). Conclusion The SOARS score uses constitutive and readily assessed individual characteristics to predict the risk of COVID-19 death. Deployment of the score could potentially inform clinical triage in pre-admission settings where expedient and reliable decision-making is key.

45,The Causal Effect of Air Pollution on COVID-19 Transmission: Evidence from China,"There is increasing concern that ambient air pollution could exacerbate COVID-19 transmission. However, estimating the relationship is challenging because it requires one to account for epidemiological characteristics, to isolate the impact of air pollution from potential confounders, and to capture the dynamic impact. We propose a new econometric framework to address these challenges: we rely on the epidemiological Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model to construct the outcome of interest, the Instrument Variable (IV) model to estimate the causal relationship, and the Flexible-Distributed-Lag (FDL) model to understand the dynamics. Using data covering all prefectural Chinese cities, we find that a 10-point (14.3%) increase in the Air Quality Index would lead to a 2.80 percentage point increase in the daily COVID-19 growth rate with 2 to 13 days of delay (0.14 ~ 0.22 increase in the reproduction number: R0).

46,Prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy blood donors in New York,"ABSTRACT Despite the high level of morbidity and mortality worldwide, there is increasing evidence for asymptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed blood specimens from 1,559 healthy blood donors, collected in the greater New York metropolitan area between the months of March and July 2020 for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using our proprietary technology, SERA (Serum Epitope Repertoire Analysis), we observed a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rates over the four-month period, from 0% [95% CI: 0 - 1.5%] (March) to 11.6% [6.0 - 21.2%] (July). Follow-up ELISA tests using S1 and nucleocapsid viral proteins confirmed most of these results. Our findings are consistent with seroprevalence studies within the region and with reports that SARS-COV-2 infections can be asymptomatic or cause only mild symptoms. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused vast morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet several studies indicate that there may be a significant number of infected people who are asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms. In this study, samples were collected from healthy blood donors in a region of rapidly increasing disease burden (New York metropolitan area) and we hypothesized that a subset would be seropositive to SARS-CoV-2.

DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing HCV and by PHE for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based approaches to SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain. Objective: To compare antibody detection in dried blood spot eluates using the Roche Elecsys immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay (reference test). Setting: One Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England. Participants: 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME. Outcome Measures: Sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population. Results: 18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using a cut-off of ten median absolute deviations above the immunoassay result with negative samples, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma. Conclusion: DBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance.

48,PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A SARS-COV-2 RAPID ANTIGENTEST: TEST PERFORMANCE IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE NETHERLANDS,"Objectives: This study was primarily conducted to evaluate clinical sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (VRD) compared to real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the VRD sensitivity for different Ct-value groups (Ct <20; Ct 20-25, Ct 25-30 and Ct > 30) and different intervals since symptom onset (< 7 days; > 7 days) were examined. Design: Prospective performance evaluation study. Setting: Municipal Health Service (GGD) COVID-19 test centres in West-Brabant, the Netherlands Participants: In order to evaluate clinical specificity, 352 symptomatic adults (> 18 years) who presented at a participating GGD test centre for a COVID- 19 test between September 28 and October 7 2020 were included. In order to evaluate clinical sensitivity, 123 symptomatic adults (> 18 years) who were tested positive with qRT-PCR in a participating GGD test centre between September 26 and October 6 were included. Results: An overall clinical specificity of 100% (95%CI : 98.9%-100%) and sensitivity of 80.7% (95% CI: 73,2%-86,9%) was found for the VRD compared to qRT-PCR. Sensitivity was the highest for low Ct-value categories and for specimen obtained within the first days after disease onset. For specimen obtained within 7 days after onset of symptoms, the overall sensitivity was 91.0% (95%: CI 82,4%-96,3%) and 98,6% (95%: CI 92,3%-100%) for samples with qRT-PCR Ct-value beneath 30. Conclusion: The VRD is a promising diagnostic test for COVID-19 community screening for symptomatic individuals within 7 days after symptom onset in function of disease control. The clinical sensitivity was highest when viral load was high, which correlated with the duration of symptoms.

50,Saliva as testing sample for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in low prevalence community setting.,"The aim of our study was to demonstrate that saliva can be used as an effective material for SARS-CoV-2 testing and screening of large population groups to identify Covid-19 clusters. The most important aspect of saliva sampling approach is the convenience of obtaining material by self- sampling that is even possible at home. In our experiments, saliva was sufficiently stable for testing for at least 24 hours after collection. The results obtained from the saliva of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient were consistent with those obtained from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from the same patient with the sensitivity 90% and specificity 100% during the first two weeks after the onset of symptoms. To demonstrate the usefulness of testing saliva material for mass screening, crowd sampling with pooling was performed on 3660 people in 3-day time (44 samples were tested positive). We conclude that saliva testing is an appropriate tool for screening campaigns and cluster detection, that is able to detect more infected people in a shorter period of time with little human resources and thus help to stop the epidemic spread more quickly.",Didzis Gavars; Mikus Gavars; Dmitrijs Perminovs; Janis Stasulans; Justine Stana; Zane Metla; Jana Pavare; Eriks Tauckels; Egils Gulbis; Uga Dumpis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216127,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216127,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True

Long-COVID was characterised by symptoms of fatigue, headache, dyspnoea and anosmia and was more likely with increasing age, BMI and female sex. Experiencing more than five symptoms during the first week of illness was associated with Long-COVID, OR=3.53 [2.76;4.50]. A simple model to distinguish between short and long-COVID at 7 days, which gained a ROC-AUC of 76%, was replicated in an independent sample of 2472 antibody positive individuals.

53,City-level SARS-CoV-2 sewage surveillance,"The COVID-19 pandemic created a global crisis impacting not only healthcare systems, but also world economies and society. Recent data have indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that viral RNA can be detected in wastewater. This suggests that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for both epidemiological surveillance, and early warning for SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the population level. In this study we sampled an urban wastewater infrastructure in the city of Ashkelon, Israel, during the end of the first COVID-19 wave in May 2020 when the number of infections seemed to be waning. We were able to show varying presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from several locations in the city during two sampling periods. This was expressed as a new index, Normalized Viral Load (NVL), which can be used in different area scales to define levels of virus activity such as red (high) or green (no), and to follow morbidity in the population at tested area. Our index showed the rise in viral load between the two sampling periods (one week apart) and indicated an increase in morbidity that was evident a month later in the population. Thus, this methodology may provide an early indication for SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak in a population before an outbreak is clinically apparent.

54,On nonlinear incidence rate of Covid-19,"Classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model with constant transmission rate and removal rate may not capture real world dynamics of epidemic due to complex influence of multiple external factors on the spread. On top of that transmission rate may vary widely in a large region due to non-stationarity of spatial features which poses difficulty in creating a global model. We modified discrete global Susceptible-Infected-Removed model by using time varying transmission rate, recovery rate and multiple spatially local models. No specific functional form of transmission rate has been assumed. We have derived the criteria for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period. A single Convolutional LSTM model is created and trained to map multiple spatiotemporal features to transmission rate. The model achieved 8.39% mean absolute percent error in terms of cumulative infection cases in each locality in a 10-day prediction period. Local interpretations of the model using perturbation method reveals local influence of different features on transmission rate which in turn is used to generate a set of generalized global interpretations. A what-if scenario with modified recovery rate illustrates rapid dampening of the spread when forecasted with the trained model. A comparative study with current normal scenario reveals key necessary steps to reach baseline.",Swarna Kamal Paul; Saikat Jana; Parama Bhaumik,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215665,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215665,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
55,Modifiable lifestyle factors and severe COVID-19 risk: Evidence from Mendelian randomization analysis,"BackgroundLifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be related to increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, little is known about whether these relationships are causal, or the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption and physical activity.

MethodsGenome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were selected as instrumental variables. GWAS summary statistics of these genetic variants for relevant lifestyle factors and severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted.

ResultsBoth genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about 2-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P<0.05). Genetically predicted physical activity was associated with about 5-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4, 20.3; P=0.02) decreased risk of severe respiratory COVID-19, but not with COVID-19 hospitalization, though the majority of the 95% CI did not include one. No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption, but associations were found when using pleiotropy robust methods.

ConclusionEvidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity causally decreases the risk of COVID-19 severe illness.

56,"What predicts adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines? Longitudinal analyses of 51,000 UK adults.","In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete, and existing studies provide limited understanding of what factors influence compliance; in particular modifiable factors. We use weekly panel data from 51,000 adults across the first three months of lockdown in the UK to identify factors that are related to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We find evidence that increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic is longitudinally related to higher compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness are related to changes in compliance. Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained, something which has not occurred in all countries.",Liam Wright; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215376,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215376,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
57,"PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST SARS-CoV-2 IN PROFESSIONALS OF A PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY AT SAO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL","Background: Covid-19 Serology may document exposure and perhaps protection to the virus, and serological test may help understand epidemic dynamics. To evaluate previous exposure to the virus we estimated the prevalence of antibodies against-SARS-CoV-2 among HPs in Adolfo Lutz Institute, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This study was performed among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil and some administrative areas of the Secretary of Health that shares common areas with the institute. We used a lateral flow immunoassay (rapid test) to detect IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2; positive samples were further evaluated using Roche Electrochemiluminescence assay and SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also offered to participants. Results: A total of 406 HPs participated. Thirty five (8.6%) tested positive on rapid test and 32 these rapid test seropositive cases were confirmed by ECLIA.. 43 HPs had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected at a median of 33 days, and the three cases not reactive at Roche ECLIA had a previous positive RNA. Outsourced professionals (34% seropositive), males (15%) workers referring COVID-19 patients at home (22%) and those living farther form the institute tended to have higher prevalence of seropositivity, but in multivariable logistic analysis only outsourced workers and those with COVID patients at home remained independently associated to seropositivity. We observed no relation of seropositivity to COVID samples handling. Presence of at least one symptom was common but some clinical manifestations as anosmia/dysgeusia. Fatigue, cough and fever were associated to seropositivity. Conclusions: We documented a relatively high (8.6%) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological reactivity in this population, with higher rates among outsourced workers and those with referring cohabitation with COVID-19 patients.

58,Analytical solution of equivalent SEIR and agent-based model of COVID-19; showing the bounds of contact tracing,"Mathematical models not only forecast the possible future but also is used to find hidden parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerical estimates can inform us of both goals. Still, the interdependencies of parameters stay obscure. Many numerical solutions have been proposed so far; however, the analytical relationship between the outbreak growth, decay and equilibrium are much less studied. In this study, we have employed both an equivalent agent-based model and a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like model to prove that the growth rate can be determined analytically in terms of other model parameters, including contact tracing rate. We identify the most sensitive parameters as undocumented transmission rate and documentation ratio. Unfortunately, these are the parameters we have the least knowledge. We derived an identity that predicts the effectiveness of contact tracing in a country from observable parameters. We underline an unavoidable dilemma: that even in the case of high contact tracing, we cannot bring the outbreak to stalemate without applying substantial quarantine; however, some countries are benefiting from contact tracing. Besides, we have shown that the seemingly same parameters of the SEIR models and agent-based models are not equivalent.

59,Changes of evening exposure to electronic devices during the COVID-19 lockdown affect the time course of sleep disturbances,"Study Objectives: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a worldwide increase in electronic devices' daily usage. The exposure to backlit screens before falling asleep leads to negative consequences on sleep health through its influence on the circadian system. We investigated the relationship between the changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19. Methods: 2123 Italians were longitudinally tested during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. During the second assessment, respondents reported the changes in the backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep. Results: Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, higher sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving their screen time habits did not show any change in the sleep parameters. Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between the modifications of the evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period.

60,Could nutrition modulate COVID-19 susceptibility and severity of disease? A systematic review,"Background: Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence. Objectives: To provide a systematic review of the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and over-nutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression and severity of, COVID-19. Methods: We synthesised information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anaemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; poly-unsaturated fatty acids; iron; selenium; zinc; anti-oxidants, and nutritional support. For each section we provide: a) a landscape review of pertinent material; b) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a systematic search of a wide range of pre-print servers; and c) a screen of six clinical trial registries. Two reviewers were assigned per section for data extraction. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16th May and 11th August, 2020. PROSPERO registration CRD42020186194. Results: Across the 13 searches, a total of 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the pre-print servers, and 433 trials were returned. A total of 288 published articles and 278 pre-print articles were taken to full text screening. In the final narrative synthesis, we cover 22 published articles, 39 pre-print articles and 79 trials. The review highlights a range of mechanistic and observational evidence to highlight the role nutrition can play in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19. However, to date, there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery, although results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Conclusions: To date there is no conclusive evidence supporting adoption of novel nutritional therapies. However, given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. There is strong evidence that prevention of obesity, and its consequent type-2 diabetes, will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes.",Not available,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20214395,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20214395,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
61,An agent-based model of spread of a pandemic with validation using COVID-19 data from New York State,"We introduce a simple agent based model where each agent carries an effective viral load that captures the instantaneous state of infection of the agent and simulate the spread of a pandemic and subsequently validate it by using publicly available COVID-19 data. Our simulation tracks the temporal evolution of a virtual city or community of agents in terms of contracting infection, recovering asymptomatically, or getting hospitalized. The virtual community is divided into family groups with 2-6 individuals in each group. Agents interact with other agents in virtual public places like at grocery stores, on public transportation and in offices. We initially seed the virtual community with a very small number of infected individuals and then monitor the disease spread and hospitalization over a period of fifty days, which is a typical time-frame for the initial spread of a pandemic. An uninfected or asymptomatic agent is randomly selected from a random family group in each simulation step for visiting a random public space. An uninfected agent contracts infection if the public place is occupied by other infected agents. We have calibrated our simulation rounds according to the size of the population of the virtual community for simulating realistic exposure of agents to a contagion. Our simulation results are consistent with the publicly available hospitalization and ICU patient data from different communities of varying sizes in New York state. Our model can predict the trend in epidemic spread and hospitalization from a set of simple parameters and could be potentially useful in exploring strategies to keep a community safe.",Amitava Datta; Peter Winkelstein; Surajit Sen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215517,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215517,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True

63,Characteristics and outcomes of clinically diagnosed RT-PCR swab negative COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study,"Patients with strong clinical features of COVID-19 with negative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing are not currently included in official statistics. The scale, characteristics and clinical relevance of this group are thus unknown. We performed a retrospective cohort study in two large London hospitals to characterize the demographic, clinical, and hospitalization outcome characteristics of swab-negative clinical COVID-19 patients. We found 1 in 5 patients with a negative swab and clinical suspicion of COVID-19 received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 within clinical documentation, discharge summary or death certificate. We compared this group to a similar swab positive cohort and found similar demographic composition, symptomology and laboratory findings. Swab-negative clinical COVID-19 patients had better outcomes, with shorter length of hospital stay, reduced need for >60% supplementary oxygen and reduced mortality. Patients with strong clinical features of COVID-19 that are swab-negative are a common clinical challenge.

64,Tocilizumab is associated with reduction in inflammation and improvement in P/F ratio in critically sick COVID19 patients,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 was initially detected in China and has been declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In the majority of patients, SARS{square}CoV{square}2 causes a mild to moderate illness characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms, with or without evidence of pneumonia. The recent studies suggest that anti-cytokine targeted therapies might be associated with benefit for patients with severe COVID-19 especially in improving respiratory failure. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor, is associated with clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients as it inhibits IL6 and decreases inflammation.

MethodsAs Tocilizumab has been an important part of our treatment and a strict criterion was followed to administer Tocilizumab, a retrospective study design used to assess the beneficial effects of Tocilizumab in improvement of ratio partial pressure of arterial Oxygen and fraction of inspired Oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in COVID19 patients has been done. 60 patients were taken for this study by using convenient sampling technique the data of demographics, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes i.e. improvement of respiratory failure depicted in the form of PF Ratio were obtained from the medical records, Statistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 21.0.

ResultsSixty patients (47 males and 13 females) with COVID{square}19 were included in this study, the mean age of patients was 53.83 (14{square}81) years. After administration of Tocilizumab the lab parameters were changed as CRP decreased down to .40 (9.6{square}73) mg/L but other parameters were not affected. The PF ratio improved in COVID-19 patients after administration of Tocilizumab the median of PF Ratio before treatment was 108 (52{square}362) and improved up to 128 (37{square}406) after Tocilizumab therapy.

ConclusionIn summary, Tocilizumab appears to be associated with improvement in P/F Ratio and CRP in COVID19 patients but other markers did not improve in response to Tocilizumab therapy in severely ill COVID-19 patients.",Muhammad Asim Rana; Mubashar Sultan Hashmi; Muhammad Muneeb Ullah Saif; Muhammad Faisal Munir; Ahad Qayyum; Rizwan Pervaiz; Muhammad Mansoor Hafeez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20210195,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20210195,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
65,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a population from Veracruz (Southeastern Mexico).,"Introduction/AimRecent studies have shown that seroprevalence is quite variable depending on the country, the population and the time of the pandemic in which the serological tests are performed. Here, we investigated the prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a population living in Veracruz City, Mexico.

MethodsFrom of June 1 to July 31, 2020, the consecutive adult patients (age [&ge;]18 years) that attended 2 ambulatory diagnostic private practice centers for testing were included. Samples were run on the Abbott Architect instrument using the commercial Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. The main outcome was seroprevalence. Demographics, previous infection to SARS-CoV-2 (according to a previous positive polymerase-chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab), self-suspicious of virus of infection (according to have in the previous 4 weeks either fever, headache, respiratory symptoms but not a confirmatory PCR) or no having symptoms were also evaluated.

ResultsA total of 2174 subjects were tested, included 53.6% women (mean age 41.8{+/-}15.17 years, range 18-98 years). One thousand and forty-one (52.5%) subjects were asymptomatic, 722 (33.2%) had suspicious of infection and 311 (14.3%) had previous infection. Overall, 642 of 2174 (29.5% [95% CI 27.59%-31.47%]) of our population were seropositive. Seropositivity among groups was 21.3% in asymptomatic, 23.4% in self-suspicious patients and 73.9% in previous infection patients.

ConclusionsWe found one of the highest seroprevalences reported for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in asymptomatic subjects (21.3%) as well in subjects with self-suspicious of COVID-19 (23.4%). The number of infected subjects in our population is not encouraging and it should be interpreted with caution.",Jose Maria Remes-Troche; Antonio Ramos-de-la-Medina; Marisol Manriquez-Reyes; Laura Martinez-Perez Maldonado; Maria Antonieta Solis-Gonzalez; Karina Hernandez-Flores; Hector Vivanco-Cid,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215558,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215558,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
66,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in France: results from nationwide serological surveillance,"Background Assessment of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is critical for monitoring the course and the extent of the epidemic. As asymptomatic or mild cases were typically not captured by surveillance data in France, we implemented nationwide serological surveillance. We present estimates for prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the French population and the proportion of infected individuals who developed potentially protective neutralizing antibodies throughout the first epidemic wave. Methods We performed serial cross-sectional sampling of residual sera over three periods: prior to (9-15 March), during (6-12 April) and following (11-17 May) a nationwide lockdown. Each sample was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the Nucleoprotein and Spike using two Luciferase-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays, and for neutralising antibodies using a pseudo-neutralisation assay. We fitted a general linear mixed model of seropositivity in a Bayesian framework to derive prevalence estimates stratified by age, sex and region. Findings In total, sera from 11 021 individuals were analysed. Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was estimated at 0.41% [0.05;0.88] mid-March, 4.14% [3.31;4.99] mid-April and 4.93% [4.02;5.89] mid-May. Approximately 70% of seropositive individuals had detectable neutralising antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in regions where circulation occurred earlier and was more intense. Seroprevalence was lowest in children under 10 years of age (2.72% [1.10;4.87]). Interpretation Seroprevalence estimates confirm that the nationwide lockdown substantially curbed transmission and that the vast majority of the French population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Low seroprevalence in school age children suggests limited susceptibility and/or transmissibility in this age group. Our results show a clear picture of the progression of the first epidemic wave and provide a framework to inform the ongoing public health response as viral transmission is picking up again in France and globally.",Stephane Le Vu; Gabrielle Jones; Francois Anna; Thierry Rose; Jean-Baptiste Richard; Sibylle Bernard-Stoecklin; Sophie Goyard; Caroline Demeret; Olivier Helynck; Corinne Robin; Virgile Monnet; Louise Perrin de Facci; Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer; Lucie Leon; Yvonnick Guillois; Laurent Filleul; Pierre Charneau; Daniel Levy-Bruhl; Sylvie van der Werf; Harold Noel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20213116,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20213116,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True

69,Analytical evaluation and critical appraisal of early commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for routine use in a diagnostic laboratory.,"BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of early commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in mild and asymptomatic subjects to enable the selection of suitable serological assays for routine diagnostic use within HCA Healthcare UK. METHODS We used serum samples from a pre-Covid era patient cohort (n=50, pre-December 2019), designated SARS-CoV-2 negative, and serum samples from a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive cohort (n=90) taken > 14 days post symptom onset (April-May 2020). We evaluated 6 ELISA assays including one confirmation assay to investigate antibody specificity. We also evaluated one point-of-care lateral flow device and one high throughput electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS The ELISA specificities ranged from 84-100%, with sensitivities ranging from 75.3-90.0%. The LFIA showed 100% specificity and 80% sensitivity using smaller sample numbers. The Roche CLIA immunoassay showed 100% specificity and 90.7% sensitivity. When used in conjunction, the Euroimmun nucleocapsid (NC) and spike-1 (S1) IgG ELISA assays had a sensitivity of 95.6%. The confirmation IgG assay showed 92.6% of samples tested contained both NC and S1 antibodies, 32.7% had NC, S1 and S2 and 0% had either S1 or S2 only. CONCLUSIONS These first generation assays were not calibrated against reference material and the results are reported qualitatively. The Roche assay and the Euroimmun NC and S1 assays had the best sensitivity overall in our hands. Combining the assays detecting NC and S1/S2 antibody increased diagnostic yield.

70,Validation of expert system enhanced deep learning algorithm for automated screening for COVID-Pneumonia on chest X-rays,"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed a limitation of artificial intelligence (AI) based medical image interpretation systems. Early in the pandemic, when need was greatest, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions. Even now, there is a need for Chest-X-ray (CxR) screening tools in low and middle income countries (LMIC), when RT-PCR is delayed, to exclude COVID-19 pneumonia (Cov-Pneum) requiring transfer to higher care. In absence of local LMIC data and poor portability of CxR DL algorithms, a new approach is needed. Axiomatically, it is faster to repurpose existing data than to generate new datasets. Here, we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool which uses an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for Cov-Pneum diagnosis, trained entirely on datasets from the pre-COVID-19 period. Portability, performance, and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. First, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine-center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiologic Cov-Pneum that may require higher care. Second, a curated dataset with 434 RT-PCR positive cases of varying levels of severity and 471 historical scans containing normal studies and non-COVID pathologies, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had accuracy of 87% with negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data for Cov-Pneum. However, sensitivity varied from 0.66 to 0.90 depending on whether RT-PCR or radiologist opinion was set as ground truth.

71,Preclinical study of DNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2,"To fight against the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is required. As potential pandemic vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines and protein-based vaccines have been rapidly developed to prevent pandemic spread worldwide. In this study, we designed plasmid DNA vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S protein) as pandemic vaccine, and the humoral, cellular, and functional immune responses were characterized to support proceeding to initial human clinical trials. After intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine encoding S protein with alum adjuvant (three times at 2-week intervals), the humoral immunoreaction, as assessed by anti-S protein or anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, and the cellular immunoreaction, as assessed by antigen-induced IFN{gamma} expression, were up-regulated. In IgG subclass analysis, IgG2b was induced as the main subclass. Based on these analyses, DNA vaccine with alum adjuvant preferentially induced Th1-type T cell polarization. We confirmed the neutralizing action of DNA vaccine-induced antibodies via two different methods, a binding assay of RBD recombinant protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and pseudovirus assay. Further B cell epitope mapping analysis using a peptide array showed that most vaccine-induced antibodies recognized the S2 and RBD subunits, but not the S1 subunit.

72,Structural basis for the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by favipiravir-RTP,"The RNA polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for infection with SARS-CoV-2, despite limited information about the molecular basis for its activity. Here we report the structure of favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) bound to a template:primer RNA duplex, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to a resolution of 2.5 Ang. The structure shows clear evidence for the inhibitor at the catalytic site of the enzyme, and resolves the conformation of key side chains and ions surrounding the binding pocket. Polymerase activity assays indicate that the inhibitor is weakly incorporated into the RNA primer strand, and suppresses RNA replication in the presence of natural nucleotides. The structure reveals an unusual, non-productive binding mode of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic site of SARS-CoV2 RdRp which explains its low rate of incorporation into the RNA primer strand.

The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 replication may be sensitive to changes in -1 PRF efficiency is currently unknown. Through an unbiased, reporter-based high-throughput compound screen, we identified merafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial, as a -1 PRF inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is robust to mutations within the pseudoknot region and is similarly effective on -1 PRF of other beta coronaviruses. Importantly, frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin substantially impedes SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, thereby providing the proof of principle of targeting -1 PRF as an effective antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2.",Yu Sun; Laura Abriola; Yulia V.

Methods We conducted a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following risk factors for worsening: age 75 years or more, age between 60 and 74 years, and presence of at least one comorbidity, or need for supplemental oxygen (3 L/min or more). Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800 mg hydroxychloroquine on Day 0 followed by 400 mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or tracheal intubation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary endpoints included mortality and clinical evolution at Day 14 and 28, viral shedding at Day 5 and 10. Results The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included due to a slowdown of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 years and 151 patients required oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint occurred in nine patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and eight patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.45-2.80; P=0.82).

Public health measures to control the virus are reliant on testing, including appropriate collection of specimens for analysis.

MethodsA prospective study of nasopharyngeal swab technique by staff in an academic tertiary referral centre was carried out. Nasopharyngeal swab technique was evaluated by a novel design of a navigated swab on a three-dimensional model head.

ResultsSwab technique of 228 participants was assessed. Technique was poor, with a success rate of nasopharyngeal swabbing at 38.6%. Angle and length of insertion were significantly different between those with successful and unsuccessful technique. Doctors were significantly more accurate than nurses and non-healthcare professionals (p<0.01).

77,Percentage HScore confirms low incidence of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in hospitalised COVID-19 patients,"ObjectiveIt has been assumed that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients show evidence of hyperinflammation of which secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is the most severe manifestation. To facilitate diagnosis of sHLH the HScore has been developed and validated. We set out to examine the prevalence of sHLH-like hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

MethodsWe retrospectively examined HScore parameters in 626 COVID-19 cases admitted to our institute of which 567 were suitable for analysis and compared these to a cohort of confirmed infection associated sHLH cases. To account for missing data, we calculated the maximum possible HScore of the recorded parameters (%HScore).

ResultsEarly measurement of HScore parameters (day -1 to 4 from diagnosis) strongly predicted the %HScore over the course of the admission (p <0.0001). The retrospective cohort of sHLH showed significantly higher %HScores as compared to COVID-19 (median 73.47 vs 18.13 respectively, p <0.0001). The overall prevalence of individuals with an 80% probability of sHLH in our COVID-19 cohort was 1.59% on admission and only rose to 4.05% during the whole disease course. In the small cohort with scores suggestive of sHLH, there was no excess mortality compared with the whole cohort. %HScores were higher in younger patients (p<0.0001) and did not reliably predict outcome at any cut-off value (AUROC 0.533, p=0.211; OR 0.99).

ConclusionSurprisingly, these findings show that sHLH-type hyperinflammation is not prevalent in COVID-19, and %HScores do not predict outcome.

79,Extending the range of COVID-19 risk factors ina Bayesian network model for personalised riskassessment,"A need is emerging for individuals to gauge their own risks of coronavirus infection as it becomes apparent that contact tracing to contain the spread of the virus is not working in many societies. This paper presents an extension of an existing Bayesian network model for an application in which people can add their own personal risk factors to calculate their probability of exposure to the virus and likely severity if they do catch the illness. The data need not be shared with any central authority. In this way, people can become more aware of their individual risks and adjust their behaviour accordingly, as many countries prepare for a second wave of infections or a prolonged pandemic. This has the advantage not only of preserving privacy but also of containing the virus more effectively by allowing users to act without the time lag of waiting to be informed that a contact has been tested and confirmed COVID-19 positive. Through a nuanced assessment of individual risk, it could also release many people from isolation who are judged highly vulnerable using cruder measures, helping to boost economic activity and decrease social isolation without unduly increasing transmission risk. Although much has been written and reported about single risk factors, little has been done to bring these factors together in a user-friendly way to give an overall risk rating. The causal probabilistic model presented here shows the power of Bayesian networks to represent the interplay of multiple, dependent variables and to predict outcomes. The network, designed for use in the UK, is built using detailed data from government and health authorities and the latest research, and is capable of dynamic updates as new information becomes available.

80,"Efficacy of stay-at-home policy and transmission of COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada: a mathematical modeling study","Background In many parts of the world, restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) that aim to reduce contact rates, including stay-at-home orders, limitations on gatherings, and closure of public places, are being lifted, with the possibility that the epidemic resurges if alternative measures are not strong enough. Here we aim to capture the combination of use of NPIs and reopening measures which will prevent an infection rebound. Methods We employ a SEAIR model with a household structure able to capture the stay-at-home policy (SAHP). To reflect the changes in the SAHP over the course of the epidemic, we vary the SAHP compliance rate, assuming that the time to compliance of all the people requested to stay-at-home follows a Gamma distribution. Using confirmed case data for the City of Toronto, we evaluate basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers and simulate how the average household size, the stay-at-home rate, the efficiency and duration of SAHP implementation, affect the outbreak trajectory. Findings The estimated basic reproduction number R_0 was 2.36 (95% CI: 2.28, 2.45) in Toronto. After the implementation of the SAHP, the contact rate outside the household fell by 39%. When people properly respect the SAHP, the outbreak can be quickly controlled, but extending its duration beyond two months (65 days) had little effect. Our findings also suggest that to avoid a large rebound of the epidemic, the average number of contacts per person per day should be kept below nine. This study suggests that fully reopening schools, offices, and other activities, is possible if the use of other NPIs is strictly adhered to. Interpretation Our model confirmed that the SAHP implemented in Toronto had a great impact in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Given the lifting of restrictive NPIs, we estimated the thresholds values of the maximum number of contacts, probability of transmission and testing needed to ensure that the reopening will be safe, i.e. maintaining an R_t<1.",Pei Yuan; Juan Li; Elena Aruffo; Qi Li; Tingting Zheng; Nicholas Ogden; Beate Sander; Jane Heffernan; Evgenia Gatov; Effie Gournis; Sarah Collier; Yi Tan; Jun Li; Julien Arino; Jacques Belair; James Watmough; Jude Dzevela Kong; Iain Moyles; Huaiping Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20181057,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20181057,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
81,From multiplex serology to serolomics: A novel approach to the antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome,"BackgroundThe emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic entails an urgent need for specific and sensitive high-throughput serological assays to assess SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. We therefore aimed at developing a fluorescent-bead based SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay for detection of antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.

MethodsProteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and protein N of SARS-CoV-1 and common cold Coronaviruses (ccCoVs) were recombinantly expressed in E. coli or HEK293 cells. Assay performance was assessed in a Covid-19 case cohort (n=48 hospitalized patients from Heidelberg) as well as n=85 age- and sex-matched pre-pandemic controls from the ESTHER study. Assay validation included comparison with home-made immunofluorescence and commercial Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays.

ResultsA sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86%-100%) was achieved in Covid-19 patients 14 days post symptom onset with dual sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 N and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The specificity obtained with this algorithm was 100% (95% CI: 96%-100%). Antibody responses to ccCoVs N were abundantly high and did not correlate with those to SARS-CoV-2 N. Inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as separate assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M, A, and G allowed for explorative analyses regarding disease progression and course of antibody response.

ConclusionThis newly developed SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay achieved high sensitivity and specificity to determine SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity. Its high throughput ability allows epidemiologic SARS-CoV-2 research in large population-based studies. Inclusion of additional pathogens into the panel as well as separate assessment of Ig isotypes will furthermore allow addressing research questions beyond SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence.",Julia Butt; Rajagopal Murugan; Theresa Hippchen; Sylvia Olberg; Monique van Straaten; Hedda Wardemann; Erec Stebbins; Hans-Georg Kraeusslich; Ralf Bartenschlager; Hermann Brenner; Vibor Laketa; Ben Schoettker; Barbara Mueller; Uta Merle; Tim Waterboer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20214916,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20214916,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
82,Modelling the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic network graph,"BackgroundWhen modelling the dispersion of an epidemic using R0, one only considers the average number of individuals each infected individual will infect. However, we know from extensive studies of social networks that there is significant variation in the number of connections and thus social contacts each individual has. Individuals with more social contacts are more likely to attract and spread infection. These individuals are likely the drivers of the epidemic, so-called superspreaders. When many superspreaders are immune, it becomes more difficult for the disease to spread, as the connectedness of the social network dramatically decreases. If one assumes all individuals being equally connected and thus as likely to spread disease as in a SIR model, this is not true.

MethodsTo account for the impact of social network structure on epidemic development, we model the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic preferential attachment graph which changes appearance proportional to observed mobility changes. We sample a serial interval distribution that determines the probability of dispersion for all infected nodes each day. We model the dispersion in different age groups using age-specific infection fatality rates. We vary the infection probabilities in different age groups and analyse the outcome.

ResultsThe impact of movement on network dynamics plays a crucial role in the spread of infections. We find that higher movement results in higher spread due to an increased probability of new connections being made within a social network. We show that saturation in the dispersion can be reached much earlier on a preferential attachment graph compared to spread on a random graph, which is more similar to estimations using R0.

ConclusionsWe provide a novel method for modelling epidemics by using a dynamic network structure related to observed mobility changes. The social network structure plays a crucial role in epidemic development, something that is often overlooked.",Patrick Bryant; Arne Elofsson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215046,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215046,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
83,Effect of park use and landscape structure on COVID-19 transmission rates,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe impacts on global public health. In the UK, social distancing measures and a nationwide lockdown were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. Green space accessibility may have been particularly important during this lockdown, as it could have provided benefits for physical and mental wellbeing, while also limiting the risk of transmission. However, the effects of public green space use on the rate of COVID-19 transmission are yet to be quantified, and as the size and accessibility of green spaces vary within local authorities, the risks and benefits to the public of using green space may well be context-dependent. To evaluate how green space affected COVID-19 transmission across 98 local authorities in England, we first split case rates into two periods, the pre-peak rise and the post-peak decline in cases, and assessed how baseline health and mobility variables influenced these rates. Next, looking at the residual case rates, we investigated how landscape structure (e.g. area and patchiness of green space) and park use influenced transmission. We first show that pre- and post-peak case rates were significantly reduced when overall mobility was low, especially in areas with high population clustering, and high population density during the post-peak period only. After accounting for known mechanisms behind transmission rates, we found that park use (showing a preference for park mobility) decreased residual pre-peak case rates, especially when green space was low and contiguous (not patchy). Whilst in the post-peak period, park use and green landscape structure had no effect on residual case rates. Our results show that utilising green spaces rather than other activities (e.g. visiting shops and workplaces) can reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19, especially during an exponential phase of transmission.",Thomas Frederick Johnson; Lisbeth A Hordley; Matthew P Greenwell; Luke C Evans,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215731,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215731,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
84,Differential Impact of Mitigation Policies and Socioeconomic Status on COVID-19 Prevalence and Social Distancing in the United States,"Background The spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the long-standing health inequalities across the U.S. as neighborhoods with fewer resources were associated with higher rates of COVID-19 transmission. Although the stay-at-home order was one of the most effective methods to contain its spread, residents in lower-income neighborhoods faced barriers to practicing social distancing. We aimed to quantify the differential impact of stay-at-home policy on COVID-19 transmission and residents mobility across neighborhoods of different levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. Methods This was a comparative interrupted time-series analysis at the county level. We included 2,087 counties from 38 states which both implemented and lifted the state-wide stay-at-home order. Every county was assigned to one of four equally-sized groups based on its levels of disadvantage, represented by the Area Deprivation Index. Prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the daily number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases by the number of residents from the 2010 Census. We used the Social Distancing Index, derived from the COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, to measure the social distancing practice. For the evaluation of implementation, the observation started from Mar 1 2020 to one day before lifting; and, for lifting, it ranged from one day after implementation to Jul 5 2020. We calculated a comparative change of daily trends in COVID-19 prevalence and Social Distancing Index between counties with three highest disadvantage levels and those with the least level before and after the implementation and lifting of the stay-at-home order, separately. Results On both stay-at-home implementation and lifting dates, COVID-19 prevalence was much higher among counties with the highest or lowest disadvantage level, while mobility decreased as the disadvantage level increased. Mobility of the most disadvantaged counties was least impacted by stay-at-home implementation and relaxation compared to counties with the most resources; however, disadvantaged counties experienced the largest relative increase in COVID-19 infection after both stay-at-home implementation and relaxation. Conclusions Neighborhoods with varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage reacted differently to the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation policies. Policymakers should consider investing more resources in disadvantaged counties as the pandemic may not stop until most neighborhoods have it under control.",Hsien-Yen Chang; Wenze Tang; Elham Hatef; Christopher Kitchen; Jonathan P.

85,2.5 Million Person-Years of Life Have Been Lost Due to COVID-19 in the United States,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by tens of millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections world-wide, has resulted in considerable levels of mortality and morbidity. The United States has been hit particularly hard having 20 percent of the worlds infections but only 4 percent of the world population. Unfortunately, significant levels of misunderstanding exist about the severity of the disease and its lethality. As COVID-19 disproportionally impacts elderly populations, the false impression that the impact on society of these deaths is minimal may be conveyed by some because elderly individuals are closer to a natural death. To assess the impact of COVID-19 in the US, I have performed calculations of person-years of life lost as a result of 194,000 premature deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection as of early October, 2020. By combining actuarial data on life expectancy and the distribution of COVID-19 associated deaths we estimate that over 2,500,000 person-years of life have been lost so far in the pandemic in the US alone, averaging over 13.25 years per person with differences noted between males and females. Importantly, nearly half of the potential years of life lost occur in non-elderly populations.

86,"A Sensitive, Rapid, and Portable CasRx-based Diagnostic Assay for SARS-CoV2","Since its first emergence from China in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally despite unprecedented containment efforts, resulting in a catastrophic worldwide pandemic. Successful identification and isolation of infected individuals can drastically curtail virus spread and limit outbreaks. However, during the early stages of global transmission, point-of-care diagnostics were largely unavailable and continue to remain difficult to procure, greatly inhibiting public health efforts to mitigate spread. Furthermore, the most prevalent testing kits rely on reagent- and time-intensive protocols to detect viral RNA, preventing rapid and cost-effective diagnosis. Therefore the development of an extensive toolkit for point-of-care diagnostics that is expeditiously adaptable to new emerging pathogens is of critical public health importance. Recently, a number of novel CRISPR-based diagnostics have been developed to detect COVID-19. Herein, we outline the development of a CRISPR-based nucleic acid molecular diagnostic utilizing a Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) to detect SARS-CoV-2, an approach we term SENSR (Sensitive Enzymatic Nucleic-acid Sequence Reporter).

87,Antibody Immunological Imprinting on COVID-19 Patients,"While the current pandemic remains a thread to human health, the polyclonal nature of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Other than SARS-CoV-2, humans are susceptible to six different coronaviruses, and previous exposure to antigenically related and divergent seasonal coronaviruses is frequent. We longitudinally profiled the early humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and quantify levels of pre-existing immunity to OC43, HKU1 and 223E seasonal coronaviruses. A strong back-boosting effect to conserved, but not variable regions of OC43 and HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike protein was observed. All patients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, with peak induction at day 7 post hospitalization. However a negative correlation was found between antibody memory boost to human coronaviruses and induction of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 spike.

88,Prediction of Covid-19 Infections Through December 2020 for 10 US States Incorporating Outdoor Temperature and School Re-Opening Effects-September Update,"A two-parameter, human behavior Covid-19 infection growth model predicts total infections between-4.2% (overprediction) and 4.5% (underprediction) of actual infections from July 27, 2020 to September 30, 2020 for 10 US States (NY, WA, GA, IL, MN, FL, OH, MI, CA, NC). During that time, total Covid-19 infections for 9 of the 10 modeled US States grew by 60% (MI) to 95% (MN). Only NY limited Covid-19 infection growth with an 11% increase from July 27 to September 30, 2020.

September is a month with contraposing effects of increased social interaction (eg, physical school openings) and outdoor temperatures decreasing to the 50F (10C) to 70F (21C) range in which outdoor activities and building ventilation are beneficially increased. All State infection predictions except GA, FL and CA predictions through September 30 are bounded by four prediction scenarios (no school with outdoor temperature effect, no school with no outdoor temperature effect, school with temperature effect, school with no temperature effect). GA, FL and CA continued along a path slightly below the linear infection growth boundary separating infection growth and decay, resulting in overprediction of infection growth over the two month simulation period(-3.1% for GA, -1.9% for FL, and -4.5% for CA).

Three eastern States (NY, NC, and GA) are most accurately represented by models that assume no significant change in social interactions coupled with minor outdoor temperature effects. Four midwestern States (IL, MI, MN, OH) are most accurately modeled with minor outdoor temperature effects due to a delayed decrease in average outdoor temperatures in the Midwest. The remaining three States (WA, FL, and CA) are also in good agreement with the model but with differing weather condition and social interaction impacts.

Overall, model predictions continue to support the basic premise that human behavior in the US oscillates across a linear infection growth boundary that divides accelerated infection growth and decaying infection transmission.",Ty A Newell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213223,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213223,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

As a result, each government has proposed emergency public health measures that are critical to delay the transmission and spread of the virus and mitigate its impacts. In Brazil, the outbreak triggered many cases of people infected with COVID-19. Considering there are no drugs or vaccines proven to be effective to treat the disease, analyzing the data of infection cases and their mathematical interpretation are essential for supporting and guiding governmental measures to suppress and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This means that estimates with mathematical models to assess the development potential of sustained human-human transmission are needed. Since the disease has its own biological characteristics, the models need to be adapted to the variability of the regions characteristics and the decision-making by both the government and the population, in order to be able to deal with real situations. Thus, in the present paper, we analyzed the official data of COVID-19 in Brazil and used the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation to predict the evolution of the disease. The model indicates that a nucleation rate is of fourth order, which indicates that Brazilians are crowding with no respect to measures of social distance and disease prevention.

90,Integration of Kalman filter in the epidemiological model: a robust approach to predict COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh,"As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh have been trying to contain the impact of a pandemic like COVID-19 since March, 2020. Although government announced an array of restricted measures to slow down the diffusion in the beginning of the pandemic, the lockdown has been lifted gradually by reopening all the industries, markets and offices with a notable exception of educational institutes. As the physical geography of Bangladesh is highly variable across the largest delta, the population of different region and their life style also differ. Thus, to get the real scenario of the current pandemic across Bangladesh, it is essential to analyze the transmission dynamics over the individual districts. In this article, we propose to integrate the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with classic SIRD model to explain the epidemic evolution of individual districts in the country. We show that UKF-SIRD model results in a robust prediction of the transmission dynamics for 1-4 months. Then we apply the robust UKF-SIRD model over different regions in Bangladesh to estimates the course of the epidemic. Our analysis demonstrate that in addition to the densely populated areas, industrial areas and popular tourist spots are in the risk of higher COVID-19 transmission.

Physical distancing is the current major strategy to suppress spread of the disease, but with enormous socio-economic costs. However, modelling and studies in isolated jurisdictions suggest that active population surveillance through systematic molecular diagnostics, combined with contact tracing and focused quarantining can significantly suppress disease spread1-3 and has significantly impacted disease transmission rates, the number of infected people, and prevented saturation of the healthcare system4-7. However, reliable systems allowing for parallel testing of 10-100,000s of patients in larger urban environments have not yet been employed.

While opening campuses could pose a major health risk, keeping instruction online could dissuade students from enrolling. Taking an ecological approach that considers the influence of state, county, and college characteristics, this study uses mixed modeling techniques and data from 89% of two- and four-year public and four-year private US colleges to assess the factors that shaped their decision to provide mostly in-person instruction as of August 1, 2020. We consider the roles of the political and religious climate, COVID-19 infections, deaths, and mask mandates, college niche, finances, dormitory capacity, faculty resistance, online readiness, and enrollment pressures. Most notably, we find that decision-making was unrelated to cumulative COVID infection and related mortality rates. The strongest predictor of in-person instruction was the proportion of state residents who voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. We also find that dormitory capacity, percentage of revenue from tuition, institutional importance to the local economy, graduation rates, and per capita endowment were associated with providing in-person instruction.",Jacob Felson; Amy Adamczyk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213363,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213363,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

97,COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies predict disease severity and survival,"COVID-19 exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and high anti-RBD antibody levels. While anti-RBD IgG levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting protection from reinfection by this strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera was unable to cross-neutralize a highly-homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, that has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus pandemics.",Wilfredo F Garcia-Beltran; Evan C Lam; Michael G Astudillo; Diane Yang; Tyler E Miller; Jared Feldman; Blake M Hauser; Timothy M Caradonna; Kiera L Clayton; Adam D Nitido; Mandakolathur R Murali; Galit Alter; Richelle C Charles; Anand Dighe; John A Branda; Jochen K Lennerz; Daniel Lingwood; Aaron G Schmidt; A.

98,FebriDx point-of-care test in patients with suspected COVID-19: a pooled diagnostic accuracy study,"BackgroundPoint-of-care (POC) tests for COVID-19 could relieve pressure on isolation resource, support infection prevention and control, and help commence more timely and appropriate treatment. We aimed to undertake a systematic review and pooled diagnostic test accuracy study of available individual patient data (IPD) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a commercial POC test (FebriDx) in patients with suspected COVID-19.

MethodsA literature search was performed on the 1st of October 2020 to identify studies reporting diagnostic accuracy statistics of the FebriDx POC test versus real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Studies were screened for risk of bias. IPD were sought from studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the study effect on the outcome of the RT-PCR test result in order to determine whether it was appropriate to pool results. Diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results15 studies were screened, and we included two published studies with 527 hospitalised patients. 523 patients had valid FebriDx results for Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), an antiviral host response protein. The FebriDx test produced a pooled sensitivity of 0.920 (95% CI: 0.875-0.950) and specificity of 0.862 (0.819-0.896) compared with RT-PCR, where there was an estimated true COVID-19 prevalence of 0.405 (0.364-0.448) and overall FebriDx test yield was 99.2%. Patients were tested at a median of 4 days [interquartile range: 2:9] after symptom onset. No differences were found in a sub-group analysis of time tested since the onset of symptoms.

ConclusionsBased on a large sample of patients from two studies during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the FebriDx POC test had reasonable diagnostic accuracy in a hospital setting with high COVID-19 prevalence, out of influenza season. More research is required to determine how FebriDx would perform in other healthcare settings with higher or lower COVID-19 prevalence, different patient populations, or when other respiratory infections are in circulation.

Trial registrationThis work was based on a pooled analysis of anonymised data from two previous studies; the CoV-19POC study, described by Clark et al. (9), the ""Southampton study"" [ISRCTN:14966673, date registered: 18/03/2020]; and a study described by Karim et al. (13) the ""Kettering study"".

Lay summaryTests to diagnose COVID-19 are crucial to help control the spread of the disease and to guide treatment. Over the last few months, tests have been developed that can detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19. These tests use complex machines in pathology laboratories accepting samples from large geographical areas. Sometimes it takes days for test results to come back. So, to reduce the wait for results, new portable tests are being developed. These point-of-care (POC) tests are designed to work close to where patients require assessment and care such as hospital emergency departments, GP surgeries or care homes. For these new POC tests to be useful, they should ideally be as good as standard laboratory tests so patients get their result quickly and can benefit from the best, safest care.

In this study we looked at published research into a new test, FebriDx, which can detect the presence of any viral infection, including infections due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as bacterial infections which can have similar symptoms. The FebriDx result was compared with that obtained on the same patients throat and nose swab and using the standard COVID-19 viral laboratory test. We were able to analyse data from two studies with a total of 523 adult patients who were receiving emergency hospital care with symptoms of COVID-19 during the early stage of the UK pandemic. Almost half of the patients were diagnosed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus using standard laboratory COVID-19 viral tests.

Our analysis demonstrated that the FebriDx POC test agreed 94 out of 100 times with the standard laboratory test results when FebriDx diagnosed the patient as free from COVID-19. However, FebriDx agreed only 82 out of 100 times with the standard laboratory test when FebriDx indicated that the patient had a COVID-19 infection. These differences have important implications for how these tests could be used. As there were far fewer FebriDx false results when the results of the FebriDx test were negative (6 out of 100) than when the results of the FebriDx test were positive (18 out of 100), we can have more confidence in a negative test result using FebriDx at the POC than a positive FebriDx result.

Overall, we have shown that the FebriDx POC test performed quite well during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with laboratory tests, especially when the POC test returned a negative test. For the future, this means that the FebriDx POC test might be helpful in making a rapid clinical decision whether to isolate a patient with COVID-19-like symptoms arriving in a busy emergency department. However, our results indicate it would not completely replace the need to conduct a confirmatory laboratory test in certain cases.

There are limitations to our findings. For example, we do not know if FebriDx will work in a similar way with patients in different settings such as in the community or care homes. Similarly, we do not know whether other viral and bacterial infections which cause similar COVID-19 symptoms, and are more common in the autumn and winter months, could influence the FebriDx test accuracy.",Samuel G Urwin; B Clare Lendrem; Jana Suklan; Kile Green; Sara Graziadio; Peter Buckle; Paul M Dark; Adam L Gordon; Daniel S Lasserson; Brian Nicholson; D Ashley Price; Charles Reynard; Mark H Wilcox; Graham Prestwich; Valerie Tate; Tristan W Clark; Raja V Reddy; Richard Body; A Joy Allen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213108,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213108,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
99,Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) is an effective alternative for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection in middle-income countries,"Molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries is still a big challenge. The reference standard, RT-qPCR, recommended by WHO, is not widely available, difficulting early identification of cases. Furthermore, the transport logistic between the sample collection point and the laboratory facilities can alter the samples, producing false negative results. RT-LAMP is a cheaper, simpler molecular technique that can be an interesting alternative to be offered in hospital laboratories. We present the evaluation of a RT-LAMP for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in two steps: the laboratory standardization and the clinical validation, comparing it with the standard RT-qPCR. In the standardization phase, limit of detection and robustness values were obtained using RNA from a Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 strain. It presented 100% agreement between triplicates (RT-LAMP agreement with all RT-qPCR reactions that presented Ct [&le;] 30) and robustness (RT-LAMP successful reactions with 80% reaction volume and 50% primer concentration). 384 nasal and pharyngeal swabs collected from symptomatic patients and stored in the INS biobank were tested and we obtained 98.75%, 87.41%, 97.65% and 92.96% for specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values respectively. Then, 383 samples from symptomatic patients with less than 15 days of disease, were tested both with the RT-LAMP and with the RT-qPCR, obtaining e 98.8%, 88.1%, 97.7% y 93.3% of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values respectively. The laboratory standardization and the clinical validation presented the same value by Kappa-Cohen index (0.88) indicating an almost perfect agreement between RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that this RT-LAMP protocol presented high diagnostic performance values and can be an effective alternative for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis in hospitals, contributing to early diagnosis and reducing the spread of virus transmission in the Peruvian population.",Oscar Escalante-Maldonado; Margot Vidal-Anzardo; Fernando Donaires; GIlmer Solis-Sanchez; Italo Gallesi; Luis Pampa-Espinoza; Maribel Huaringa; Nancy Rojas-Serrano; Coralith Garcia; Eddie Angles-Yanqui; Ronnie Gustavo Gavilan; RIcardo Duraes-Carvalho; Cesar Cabezas; Paulo Vitor Marques Simas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212977,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212977,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
100,Intravenous Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Extracorporeal Oxygenation Patients with Severe COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"BackgroundThere is an ongoing critical need to improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the most severely affected patients. Adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have the potential to benefit critically ill patients with acute respiratory syndrome SARS-COV-2 infection, but clinical data supporting efficacy are lacking.

MethodsWe conducted a case-control study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To evaluate clinical responsiveness in the most critically ill patient we examined outcomes in a sub-group of those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Patients (n=9) were administered with up to 3 infusions of intravenous (IV) MSCs and compared to a local ECMO control group (n=31). The primary outcome was safety, and the secondary outcomes were all- cause mortality (or rate of hospital discharge), cytokine levels, and viral clearance.

FindingsMSC infusions (12 patients) were well tolerated and no side effects occurred. Of ECMO patients receiving MSC infusions, 2 out of 9 died (22.2%; 95%CI: 2.8%, 60.0%) compared with a mortality of 15 of 31 (48.4%; 95%CI: 30.2%, 66.9%; p = 0.25) in the ECMO control group. Isolated plasma exosomes containing the SARS-COV-2 Spike protein decreased after MSC infusions between day 14 or 21 after administration (p=0.003 and p=0.005, respectively) and was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 IgG Spike protein titer at same time points (p = 0.006 and p=0.007, respectively). Control ECMO patients receiving convalescent plasma did not clear COVID-19 IgG over the same time frame.

InterpretationTogether these findings suggest that MSC IV infusion is well tolerated in patients with a broad range of severity including the most severe COVID-19 ARDS requiring ECMO. These data also raise the possibility that MSCs, in addition to exerting an immunomodulatory effect, contribute to viral clearance and strongly support the conduct of randomized placebo-controlled trial.",Sunjay Kaushal; Aisha Khan; Kristopher Deatrick; Derek K Ng; Abigail Snyder; Aakash Shah; Lina V Caceres; Ketty Bacallao; Melania Bembea; Allen Everett; Jie Zhu; David Kaczorowski; Ronson Madathil; Ali Tabatabai; Geoffrey Rosenthal; Adriana Brooks; Bangon Longsomboon; Rachana Mishra; Progyaparamita Saha; Yvenie Desire; Russell Saltzman; Kim G Hankey; Sixto A Arias; Folusakin Ayoade; Jairo A.

101,Indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric health-care use and severe disease: a retrospective national cohort study,"BackgroundSevere disease directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is rare. However, the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric health have not been fully quantified. We examined paediatric health-care utilisation, incidence of severe disease, and mortality during the lockdown period in Scotland.

MethodsThis national retrospective cohort study examined national data for emergency childhood primary and secondary care utilisation following national lockdown on March 23, 2020. To determine whether social distancing measures and caregiver behavioural changes were associated with delayed care-seeking and increased disease severity on presentation, unplanned, emergency admissions requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for the two national Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) were analysed. PICU admissions were grouped by diagnostic category, and disease severity on presentation calculated. National statutory death records were consulted to establish childhood mortality rates and causes of death. For all observations, the lockdown period was compared to equivalent dates in 2016-2019.

FindingsWe identified 273,455 unscheduled primary care attendances; 462,437 emergency department attendances; 54,076 emergency hospital admissions; 413 PICU emergency admissions; and 415 deaths during the lockdown study period and equivalent dates in previous years. The rates of emergency presentations to primary and secondary care fell during lockdown in comparison to previous years. Emergency PICU admissions for children requiring invasive mechanical ventilation also fell, with an odds ratio of 0{middle dot}52 for chance of admission during lockdown (95% CI 0{middle dot}37-0{middle dot}73, p < 0{middle dot}001). Clinical severity scores did not suggest children were presenting with more advanced disease. The greatest reduction in PICU admissions was for diseases of the respiratory system; those for injury, poisoning or other external causes were equivalent to previous years. Mortality during lockdown did not change significantly compared to 2016-2019.

InterpretationNational lockdown led a reduction in paediatric emergency care utilisation, without associated evidence of severe harm.

FundingNone

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSData on the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children at a population level are limited. We searched PubMed and medRxiv on October 13, 2020, for studies published from Jan 1, 2020 examining the indirect effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and associated changes in caregiver health-care seeking behaviour, on the risk of severe paediatric disease and death. We used the search terms COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, non-pharmaceutical interventions, indirect, and children, as well as manually searching references in other relevant papers. Terms were searched individually and in combination as necessary, with no language restrictions. We identified one study that modelled the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on child deaths in low- and middle-income countries. Other studies analysed in isolation the effects of NPIs and other behavioural changes on emergency department attendances, hospital admission rates, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission rates, or the incidence of specific presentations, such as asthma exacerbations. Some case series described delayed care-seeking for children with non-SARS-CoV-2 disease. We did not identify any national studies examining the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of severe paediatric disease and mortality.

Added value of this studyThis national study quantified the changes following national lockdown in Scotland on March 23, 2020. We examined data for unscheduled primary care and emergency department attendances, emergency hospital admissions, emergency paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and paediatric mortality. Rates were compared with previous years. We found a reduction in paediatric emergency care utilisation rates associated with national lockdown. This reduction is likely to be due to a combination of changes in health care seeking behavior, and a fall in overall burden of paediatric infectious disease. These measures did not appear to have been associated with evidence of severe harm to children in Scotland, as evidenced by severity scores on presentation to PICU or mortality.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis is the first comprehensive population-based assessment at a national level of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on severe paediatric morbidity and mortality. Despite a significant reduction in health-care utilisation rates, we did not find associated evidence of severe harm. This study will assist policy makers, health-care providers and the public in evaluating the effects of lockdown on the risk of severe paediatric disease at a population level.",Thomas C Williams; Clare MacRae; Olivia Swann; Haris Haseeb; Steve Cunningham; Philip Davies; Neil Gibson; Christopher Lamb; Richard Levin; Catherine McDougall; Jillian McFadzean; Ian Piper; Alastair Turner; Steve Turner; Margrethe Van Dijke; Don Urquhart; Bruce Guthrie; Ross Langley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20212308,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20212308,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
102,A Comparative Analysis of System Features Used in the TREC-COVID Information Retrieval Challenge,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rapidly growing quantity of scientific publications from journal articles, preprints, and other sources. The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Based on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a systems ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections.",Jimmy Chen; William Hersh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213645,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213645,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

Design, Multicentre , randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting Two hospitals in Wuhan, China, 5 March 2020 to 28 March 2020. Participants 101 severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage aged between 18-74 years. Intervention Patients were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive either UC-MSCs (40 million cells per infusion) or placebo on days 0, 3, and 6. Main outcome measures The primary endpoints were safety and an altered proportion of whole lung lesion size from baseline to day 28, measured by chest computed tomography. Secondary outcomes were reduction of consolidation lesion sizeand lung function improvement (6-minute walk test, maximum vital capacity, diffusing capacity). Primary analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. Results 100 patients were finally recruited to receive either UC-MSCs (n = 65) or placebo (n = 35). The patients receiving UC-MSCs exhibited a trend of numerical improvement in whole lung lesion size from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo cases (the median difference was -13.31%, 95%CI -29.14%, 2.13%, P=0.080). UC-MSCs administration significantly reduced the proportions of consolidation lesion size from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo (median difference: -15.45%, 95% CI -30.82%, -0.39%, P=0.043). The 6-minute walk test showed an increased distance in patients treated with UC-MSCs (difference: 27.00 m, 95% CI 0.00, 57.00, P=0.057). The incidence of adverse events was similar, and no serious adverse events were observed in the two groups.

104,Different mutations in SARS-CoV-2 associate with severe and mild outcome,"IntroductionGenomic alterations in a viral genome can lead to either better or worse outcome and identifying these mutations is of utmost importance. Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome.

MethodsMutations in viral sequences from the GISAID virus repository were evaluated by using ""hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019"" as the reference. Patient outcomes were classified as mild disease, hospitalization and severe disease (death or documented treatment in an intensive-care unit). Chi-square test was applied to examine the association between each mutation and patient outcome. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and results passing a FDR cutoff of 5% were accepted as significant.

ResultMutations were mapped to amino acid changes for 2,120 non-silent mutations. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in the 3-to5 exonuclease, in ORF3a, NSP2 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the surface (S) glycoprotein and in NSP7. Five out of 17 of the most significant mutations mapped onto a 10 amino acid long phosphorylated stretch of N indicating that in spite of obvious sampling restrictions the approach can find functionally relevant sites in the viral genome.

105,The Safety of Contemporary Planned Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has put an unprecedented burden on global healthcare, including detrimental implications for the volume and provision of surgical services. The aim of this audit was to assess if the planned surgical cancer care (both diagnostic for possible cancer, and treatment of known cancer) during this period of widespread community and hospital based COVID-19 infection resulted in patients acquiring symptomatic COVID-19 as a consequence of their surgical admission, and if so, what the impact on patients was.

MethodsA prospective audit of all patients undergoing elective cancer surgery in Greater Manchester operated on between 01/05/2020 and 31/06/2020 was undertaken after the introduction of specific peri operative COVID safety measures across Greater Manchester cancer surgical cells. The COVID related outcomes for all cancer patients operated on in Greater Manchester were recorded.

ResultsOf the 1501 patients undergoing surgery, one (<0.1%) was diagnosed with COVID-19 in hospital within 14 days of surgery. This patient did not require admission to critical care due to post-operative COVID-19 diagnosis, and there was no associated mortality related to post-operative COVID-19 infection.

ConclusionThe use of peri operative COVID-19 infection prevention strategies has allowed for the safe continuation of elective cancer surgery during this pandemic in all surgical units, without significant additional COVID-19 related morbidity or mortality.",David Shackley; Struan Henry Gray; Susannah Penney; Lisa Galligan-Dawson; Freya Howle; Sanjay Arya; John Hunter; Francis Andrews; Colin Wasson; Murray Luckas; Brendan Ryan; Jane Eddleston; Chris Brookes; Christopher Harrison,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20207803,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20207803,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

Numerous teams are quickly developing artificial intelligence approaches to these problems, including using deep learning to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis from computed tomography (CT) imaging data. In this work, we assess the value of aggregated chest CT data for COVID-19 prognosis compared to clinical metadata alone. We develop a novel patient-level algorithm to aggregate the chest CT volume into a 2D representation that can be easily integrated with clinical metadata to distinguish Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19+) from other cases of viral pneumonia and normal healthy chest CT volumes with state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we present a multitask model for joint segmentation of different classes of pulmonary lesions present in COVID-19 infected lungs that can outperform individual segmentation models for each task. We directly compare this multitask segmentation approach to combining feature-agnostic volumetric CT classification feature maps with clinical metadata for predicting mortality. These approaches enable the automated extraction of clinically relevant features from chest CT volumes for risk stratification of COVID-19+ patients.",Anusua Trivedi; Anthony Ortiz; Jocelyn Desbiens; Caleb Robinson; Marian Blazes; Sunil Gupta; Rahul Dodhia; Pavan Bhatraju; W.

107,Correlation between Chest CT Severity Scores and the Clinical Parameters of Adult Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,"PurposeOur aim is to correlate the clinical condition of patients with COVID-19 infection with the 25 Point CT severity score by Chang et al (devised for assessment of ARDS in patients with SARS in 2005).

Material and MethodsData of consecutive symptomatic patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 infection and presented to our hospital, was collected from March to April 2020. All patients underwent two consecutive RT-PCR tests and had a non-contrast HRCT scan done at presentation. From the original cohort of 1062 patients, 160 patients were excluded leaving a total number of 902 patients.

ResultsThe mean age was 44.2 {+/-}11.9 years [85.3%males, 14.7%females]. CT severity score found to be positively correlated with lymphopenia, increased serum CRP, d-dimer and ferritin levels (p < 0.0001).

108,Correlation of COVID-19 Mortality with Clinical Parameters in an Urban and Suburban Nursing Home Population,"Importance and ObjectiveCOVID-19 has a high mortality rate amongst nursing home populations (26.4% nationally and 28.3% in New Jersey). Identification of factors influencing mortality in COVID-19 positive nursing home populations may help direct physicians towards appropriate glycemic, blood pressure, weight, kidney function, lipid, thyroid, and hematologic management to reduce COVID-19 mortality.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective cross-sectional study of patients in two nursing home facilities (one urban, one suburban) from 3/16/2020 to 7/13/2020 with positive COVID-19 PCR assays. Age, race, sex, lipids, hematologic parameters, body mass index, blood pressure, thyroid function, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin A1c were correlated with COVID-19 mortality by chi-squared analysis.

Main Outcome and Results56 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. Mortality was 14.3% while the New Jersey nursing home average mortality rate was 28.3% as of August 2020. Our patient cohort had a 49.5% reduction in mortality compared to the state average.

In our overall cohort, none of the clinical parameters correlated with COVID-19 mortality using chi-squared analysis. In the 56 patient cohort, average clinical and laboratory findings were 74.0 years, 62.5% female, 28.5% uncontrolled hypertension, BMI 25.6, hemoglobin A1c 6.4, TSH 2.4, vitamin B12 568.3, folate 12.4, iron 47.8, total iron binding capacity 271.8, hemoglobin 11.6, albumin 3.5, triglycerides 100.3, total cholesterol 133.5, HDL 40.9, and BUN to Creatinine ratio 22.2:1. Logistic multivariate regression analyses failed to demonstrate clinically significant correlation with COVID-19 mortality.

In the urban nursing home, BUN to creatinine ratio exceeding 20:1 was the only factor that showed statistical significance to COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.03). In the suburban nursing home, age over 80 was the only clinical factor demonstrating statistical significance to COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.003).

Conclusions and RelevanceIn our COVID-19 positive nursing home patients, no one parameter was clinically significant in the overall 56-patient cohort; however, mortality in our population was 14.3% compared to New Jerseys 28.3%, a 49.5% reduction in mortality. Rigorous control of the aforementioned clinical parameters may have contributed to this reduction in mortality. Further research requires analysis of more nursing home patients to determine whether rigorous control of clinical parameters decreases mortality from COVID-19.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat clinical parameters lead to a lower mortality rate in nursing home patients with COVID-19?

FindingsIn this cross-sectional analysis of 56 SARS-CoV-2 positive New Jersey nursing home residents from March to July 2020, controlling hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, hematologic and lipid panels to recommended levels yielded a mortality rate of 14.3%, a 49.5% reduction from the 28.3% mortality rate of COVID-19 in New Jersey nursing homes.

109,Risks and Benefits of Antibiotics vs. COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality,"ObjectivesThe purpose is to analyze the potential association of each antibiotic consumption rate and use ratio with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and to investigate the efficacy and safe use of antibiotics against COVID-19.

DesignRetrospective statistical analysis study of antibiotic use compared with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

MethodsEach antibiotic defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day as each antibiotic consumption rate was available in the official reports and each antibacterial use ratio data was calculated from them. Coronavirus Disease data were obtained from the WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard. The relationships between the sum of DDD, each antibacterial DDD, each antibiotic use ratio, and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality were examined. The statistical correlation was calculated by univariate linear regression analysis and expressed by Pearsons correlation coefficient.

ResultsThe sum of DDD had no statistical correlation with mortality and morbidity. Cephalosporins were a negative correlation with them. Penicillins had a weak positive correlation with them. Macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonates showed a slightly negative correlation tendency with mortality.

ConclusionsCephalosporins may affect less COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Penicillins suggest to accelerate them. The combination of cephalosporins with macrolides or quinolones may be a helpful treatment. The difference in antibiotic use between Japan and EU/EEA countries will suggest an explanation for the reduction in morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19.",Hisaya Tanioka; Sayaka Tanioka,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213603,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213603,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
110,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Suicide and Self Harm among Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department of a Teaching Hospital in Nepal,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge that is not just limited to the physical consequences but also a significant degree of a mental health crisis. Self-harm (SH) and suicide are its extreme effects. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence and clinical profile of suicide and SH in our ED.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. Records of all fatal and nonfatal SH patients presenting to the ED during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) was included by searching the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The prevalence and the clinical profile of the patients were compared between these three periods.

ResultsA total of 125 (periods 1=55, 2=38, and 3=32) suicide and SH cases were analyzed. The cases of suicide/SH had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown period in comparison to the period 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3-34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p-value=0.045) with increased hospital admission (p-value =0.009) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6 % and 3.1%) (p-value=.001).

ConclusionWe found an increase in patients presenting with suicide and SH in our ED during the pandemic which is likely to reflect an increased prevalence of mental illness in the community. We hope that the result will prime all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis.",Roshana Shrestha; Shisir Siwakoti; Saumya Singh; Anmol Purna Shrestha,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213769,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213769,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
111,Guiding Austria through the COVID-19 Epidemics with a Forecast-Based Early Warning System,"BackgroundThe corona crisis hit Austria at the end of February 2020 with one of the first European superspreading events. In response, the governmental crisis unit commissioned a forecast consortium with regularly projections of case numbers and demand for hospital beds.

MethodsWe consolidated the output of three independent epidemiological models (ranging from agent-based micro simulation to parsimonious compartmental models) and published weekly short-term forecasts for the number of confirmed cases as well as estimates and upper bounds for the required hospital beds.

FindingsHere, we report om four key contributions by which our forecasting and reporting system has helped shaping Austrias policy to navigate the crisis and re-open the country step-wise, namely (i) when and where case numbers are expected to peak during the first wave, (ii) how to safely re-open the country after passing this peak, (iii) how to evaluate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and (iv) provide hospital managers guidance to plan health-care capacities.

InterpretationComplex mathematical epidemiological models play an important role in guiding governmental responses during pandemic crises, provided they are used as a monitoring system to detect epidemiological change points. For policy-makers, the media and the public, it might be problematic to distinguish short-term forecasts from worst-case scenarios with undefined levels of certainty, creating distrust in the legitimacy and accuracy of such models. However, when used as a short-term forecast-based monitoring system, the models can inform decisions to ease or strengthen governmental responses.",Martin Bicher; Martin Zuba; Lukas Rainer; Florian Bachner; Claire Rippinger; Herwig Ostermann; Nikolas Popper; Stefan Thurner; Peter Klimek,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214767,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214767,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
112,"Lessons from applied large-scale pooling of 133,816 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests","Pooling multiple swab samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis was proposed as a strategy to reduce costs and increase throughput of SARS-CoV-2 tests. However, reports on practical large-scale group testing for SARS-CoV-2 have been scant. Key open questions concern reduced sensitivity due to sample dilution; the rate of false positives; the actual efficiency (number of tests saved by pooling) and the impact of infection rate in the population on assay performance. Here we report analysis of 133,816 samples collected at April-September 2020, tested by pooling for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We spared 76% of RNA extraction and RT-PCR tests, despite the reality of frequently changing prevalence rate (0.5%-6%). Surprisingly, we observed pooling efficiency and sensitivity that exceed theoretical predictions, which resulted from non-random distribution of positive samples in pools. Overall, the findings strongly support the use of pooling for efficient large high throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing.",Netta Barak; Roni Ben-Ami; Tal Sido; Amir Perri; Aviad Shtoyer; Mila Rivkin; Tamar Licht; Ayelet Peretz; Judith Magenheim; Irit Fogel; Ayala Livneh; Yutti Daitch; Esther Oiknine-Djian; Gil Benedek; Yuval Dor; Dana G Wolf; Moran Yassour,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213405,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213405,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
113,Temporal course of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity in patients with COVID-19 following the first clinical presentation,"Knowledge of the sensitivities of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody tests beyond 35 days after the clinical onset of COVID-19 is insufficient. We aimed to describe positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included.. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminscence, ECLIA), four enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were [&ge;]95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs [&ge;]95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were [&ge;]95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. An orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.",Martin Risch; Myriam Weber; Sarah Thiel; Kirsten Grossmann; Nadia Wohlwend; Thomas Risch; Dorothea Hillmann; Michael Ritzler; Francesca Ferrara; Susanna Bigler; Konrad Egli; Thomas Bodmer; Mauro Imperiali; Yacir Salimi; Felix Fleisch; Alexia Cusini; Harald Renz; Philipp Kohler; Pietro Vernazza; Christian R Kahlert; Matthias Paprotny; Lorenz Risch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214445,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214445,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
114,Biomimetic Virus-like Particles as SARS-CoV-2 Positive Controls for RT-PCR Diagnostics,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible disease that has affected more than 90% of the countries worldwide. At least 17 million individuals have been infected, and some countries are still battling first or second waves of the pandemic. Nucleic acid tests, especially reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have become the workhorse for early detection of COVID-19 infection. Positive controls for the molecular assays have been developed to validate each test and to provide high accuracy. However, most available positive controls require cold-chain distribution and cannot serve as full-process control. To overcome these shortcomings, we report the production of biomimetic virus-like particles (VLPs) as SARS-CoV-2 positive controls. A SARS-CoV-2 detection module for RT-PCR was encapsidated into VLPs from a bacteriophage and a plant virus. The chimeric VLPs were obtained either by in vivo reconstitution and co-expression of the target detection module and coat proteins or by in vitro assembly of purified detection module RNA sequences and coat proteins. These VLP-based positive controls mimic SARS-CoV-2 packaged RNA while being non-infectious. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the positive controls are scalable, stable, and can serve broadly as controls, from RNA extraction to PCR in clinical settings.

115,Association between live childhood vaccines and COVID-19 outcomes: a national-level analysis,"We investigated whether countries with higher coverage of childhood live vaccines [BCG or measles-containing-vaccine (MCV)] have reduced risk of COVID-19 related mortality, accounting for known systems differences between countries. In this ecological study of 140 countries using publicly available national-level data, higher vaccine coverage, representing estimated proportion of people vaccinated during the last 15 years, was associated with lower COVID-19 deaths. The associations attenuated for both vaccine variables, and MCV coverage became no longer significant once adjusted for a validated summary score accounting for life expectancy and healthcare quality indicators, the Healthcare access and quality index (HAQI). The magnitude of association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 death rate varied according to HAQI, and MCV coverage had little effect on the association between BCG and COVID-19 deaths. While there are associations between live vaccine coverage and COVID-19 outcomes, the vaccine coverage variables themselves were strongly correlated with COVID-19 testing rate, HAQI, and life expectancy. This suggests that the population-level associations may be further confounded by differences in structural health systems and policies.

117,A Study on the Effects of Containment Policies and Vaccination on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2,"This paper presents a method to predict the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in a population with a known age-structure, and then, to quantify the effects of various containment policies, including those policies that affect each age-group differently. The model itself is a compartmental model in which each compartment is divided into a number of age-groups. The parameter of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented. And then it is shown how we can use this framework to optimality distribute a limited number of vaccine units in a given population to maximise their impact and lower the total number of infectious individuals.

118,Echo chambers as early warning signals of widespread vaccine refusal in social-epidemiological networks,"Sudden shifts in population health and vaccination rates occur as the dynamics of some epidemiological models go through a critical point; literature shows that this is sometimes foreshadowed by early warning signals (EWS). We investigate different structural measures of a network as candidate EWS of infectious disease outbreaks and changes in popular vaccine sentiment. We construct a multiplex disease model coupling infectious disease spread and social contact dynamics. We find that the number and mean size of echo chambers predict transitions in the infection dynamics, as do opinion-based communities. Graph modularity also gives early warnings, though the clustering coefficient shows no significant pre-outbreak changes. Change point tests applied to the EWS show decreasing efficacy as social norms strengthen. Therefore, many measures of social network connectivity can predict approaching critical changes in vaccine uptake and aggregate health, thereby providing valuable tools for improving public health.",Brendon C Phillips; Chris Bauch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214312,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214312,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
119,"Quantifying Asymptomatic Infection and Transmission of COVID-19 in New York City using Observed Cases, Serology and Testing Capacity","The contributions of asymptomatic infections to herd immunity and community transmission are key to the resurgence and control of COVID-19, but are difficult to estimate using current models that ignore changes in testing capacity. Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13% to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with pre-symptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates than symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection sub-populations have reproductive numbers lower than 3. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss. Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of SARS-Cov-2 should be reconsidered.

Significance StatementAs health officials face another wave of COVID-19, they require estimates of the proportion of infected cases that develop symptoms, and the extent to which symptomatic and asymptomatic cases contribute to community transmission. Recent asymptomatic testing guidelines are ambiguous. Using an epidemiological model that includes testing capacity, we show that most infections are asymptomatic but contribute substantially to community transmission in the aggregate. Their individual transmissibility remains uncertain. If they transmit as well as symptomatic infections, the epidemic may spread at faster rates than current models often assume. If they do not, then each symptomatic case generates on average a higher number of secondary infections than typically assumed. Regardless, controlling transmission requires community-wide interventions informed by extensive, well-documented asymptomatic testing.",Rahul Subramanian; Qixin He; Mercedes Pascual,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20214049,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20214049,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
120,"Monitoring for outbreak associated excess mortality in an African city: Detection limits in Antananarivo, Madagascar","Quantitative estimates of the impact of infectious disease outbreaks are required to develop measured policy responses. In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo in Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak. The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 154% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detecting anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in the capital of Madagascar. Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline.

122,Why do per capita COVID-19 Case Rates Differ Between U.S. States?,"BackgroundThe popular press has explored the differences among U.S. states in rates of COVID-19 cases, mostly focusing on political party differences, and often mentioning that political party differences in health outcomes are confounded by demographic and socio-economic differences between Democratic areas and Republican areas. The purpose of this paper is to present a thorough analysis of these issues.

Design and Methods: State-specific COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people was the main outcome studied, with explanatory variables from Bureau of Census surveys, including percentages of the state population that were Hispanic, black, below poverty level, had at least a bachelors degree, or were uninsured, along with median age, median income, population density, and degree of urbanization. We also included political party in power as an explanatory variable in multiple linear regression. The units of analysis in this study are the 50 U.S. states.

ResultsAll explanatory variables were at least marginally statistically significantly associated with case rate in univariate regression analysis, except for population density and urbanization. All the census characteristics were at least marginally associated with party in power in one factor analysis of variance, except for percentage black. In a forward stepwise procedure in a multivariable model for case rate, percentages of the state population that were Hispanic or black, median age, median income, population density, and (residual) percentage poverty were retained as statistically significant and explained 62% of the variation between states in case rates. In a model with political party in power included, along with any additional variables that notably affected the adjusted association between party in power and case rate, 69% of the variance between states in case rates was explained, and adjusted case rates per 100,000 people were 2155 for states with Democratic governments, 2269 for states with mixed governments, and 2738 for Republican-led states. These estimates are based on data through October 8, 2020.

ConclusionsU.S. state-specific demographic and socio-economic variables are strongly associated with the states COVID-19 case rates, so must be considered in analysis of variation in case rates between the states.

123,Statistical deconvolution for inference of infection time series,"Accurate measurement of daily infection incidence is crucial to epidemic response. However, delays in symptom onset, testing, and reporting obscure the dynamics of transmission, necessitating methods to remove the effects of stochastic delays from observed data. Existing estimators can be sensitive to model misspecification and censored observations; many analysts have instead used methods that exhibit strong bias or do not account for delays. We develop an estimator with a regularization scheme to cope with these sources of noise, which we term the Robust Incidence Deconvolution Estimator (RIDE). We validate RIDE on synthetic data, comparing accuracy and stability to existing approaches. We then use RIDE to study COVID-19 records in the United States, and find evidence that infection estimates from reported cases can be more informative than estimates from mortality data.

AimThe aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on childrens and adolescents mental health in Greece.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 1,232 Greek parents of children and adolescents aged < 18 years was conducted in March and May 2020. Parents provided information about sociodemographic characteristics, family everyday life during the lockdown and the pandemic psychological impact on their children.

ResultsApproximately one-third (35.1%) of parents reported that the psychological health of their children was considerably affected. The most significant concern was social isolation. Unemployment, increased family conflicts, no opportunity for tele-work and a deteriorating psychological health of the parent, as well as childrens previous history of physical health conditions were all significantly associated with adverse mental health impact.

ConclusionA considerable proportion of children and adolescents may experience adverse mental health effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures, and socioeconomic inequalities may be associated with these effects.",Konstantina Magklara; Helen Lazaratou; Anastasia Barbouni; Konstantinos Poulas; Konstantinos Farsalinos; - Coronavirus Greece Research Group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214643,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214643,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
125,The implications of religious event and holidays on the transmission of SARS-CoV2 : the impact of behavioral changes on transmission,"IntroductionThe risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV2 have been widely studied and it was evident that a populations behavior has a direct effect on the risk of transmission. Public health measures and regulation are largely kept to control and direct these behaviors. In this study, we describe the change in transmission in SARS-CoV2 in relation to demographics before and after two major religious events: ""Eid Alfitr"" and ""Ashura""

MethodsThis is a national observational study conducted in Bahrain in September 2020 to compare the number and demographics of all newly diagnosed cases before and after Eid Alfitr (religious holiday) and Ashura religious event. A 10 day period before the event was compared to a 10 day period after the event by ten days. Data on the number of tests, number of new cases, their demographics (age, gender, nationality) and presence of symptoms were collected and analyzed.

ResultsThere was significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases after both Eid Alfitr (1997 more cases, with a 67% increase) and Ashura (4232 more cases with 2.19 times more cases). The majority of new cases after the religious events were found in local Bahrainis, from 472 cases to 2169 cases after Eid, and from 2201 to 6639 cases after Ashura. The rise was most notable in females (increased by 4.89 times after Eid and by 2.69 times after Ashura), children (increased by 4.69 times after Eid and by 5 times after Ashura) and elderly above the age of 60 years (increased by 5.7 times after Eid and by 3.23 times after Ashura).

ConclusionIt is evident that religious events and holidays have important implications on the transmission of SARS-CoV2. This increased in transmission is related mainly to the behavior of the population in those days. Children, female, and elderly were the most affected categories due to these events. A thorough public health plan to limit the spread of the infection at these events should be planned and implemented ahead of time.",Abdulkarim Abdulrahman; Abdulla Ismael AlAwadhi; Muath Almajthoob; Manaf AlQahtani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214056,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214056,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
126,COVID-19 IN CHILDREN WITH RHEUMATIC DISEASES (RD) IN THE SPANISH NATIONAL COHORT EPICO-AEP.,"ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 infection in adults with rheumatic diseases (RD) is a cause for concern. Data in the pediatric population are practically absent. We aimed to describe the prevalence of patients with RD and their complications among children admitted with COVID-19 in the Spanish national cohort EPICO-AEP; a multicenter prospective national study.

MethodsChildren <18 years old with RD and COVID-19 enrolled in EPICO-AEP were included in this study.

ResultsBy June 30th 2020, 350 children were admitted in secondary and tertiary hospitals of Spain with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 8 patients presented RD (2.2% of those hospitalized). All were female. The median age was 12.1 years (IQR 8.3-14.5). The diagnosis related with COVID-19 were febrile syndrome and/or upper respiratory infection (4 cases) and pneumonia (4 cases). One of the 8 (12.5%) patients with a severe juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) with interstitial lung disease died. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was the most frequent diagnosis in 3/8 (37.5%) patients. In 5/8 (62.5%) cases, the RD was not fully controlled, and all patients except one received corticosteroid treatment.

ConclusionsChildren with RD have accounted for 2.2% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our series. The evolution has been moderately favorable, with one deceased. In case of active disease and use of corticosteroids patients should be managed with caution.

What is already known about this subject?O_LIStudies in adults with rheumatic disesases (RD) show that immune-mediated inflammatory disease and use of biologics are not associated with worse COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIPoorly controlled active RD or some treatments such as corticosteroids, may have an increased risk of infection and serious disease in adults. No data in children.
C_LI

What does this study add?O_LIPediatric data from the national EPICO-AEP registry in Spain are presented, where children with RD and COVID-19 were 2.2% of those hospitalized.
C_LIO_LIActive disease and the use of corticosteroids could be considered risk factors in the pediatric population as well as in adults.

127,Structural and metabolic brain abnormalities in COVID-19 patients with sudden loss of smell,"ObjectivesSudden loss of smell is a very common symptom of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This study characterizes the structural and metabolic cerebral correlates of dysosmia in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsStructural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) were prospectively acquired simultaneously on a hybrid PET-MR in twelve patients (2 males, 10 females, mean age: 42.6 years, age range: 23-60 years) with sudden dysosmia and positive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. FDG-PET data were analysed using a voxel-based approach and compared with that of a group of healthy subjects.

ResultsBilateral blocking of the olfactory cleft was observed in six patients, while subtle olfactory bulb asymmetry was found in three patients. No MRI signal abnormality downstream of the olfactory tract was observed. Heterogeneous (decrease or increase) glucose metabolism abnormalities were observed in core olfactory and high-order neocortical areas. A modulation of regional cerebral glucose metabolism by the severity and the duration of COVID-19-related dysosmia was disclosed using correlation analyses.

ConclusionsThis PET-MR study shows that sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 is not related to central involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasiveness. Loss of smell is associated with heterogeneous cerebral metabolic changes in core olfactory and high-order cortical areas likely related to combined processes of deafferentation and active functional reorganisation secondary to the lack of olfactory stimulation.",Maxime Niesen; Nicola Trotta; Antoine Noel; Tim Coolen; Georges Fayad; Gil Leurkin-Sterk; Isabelle Delpierre; Sophie Henrard; Niloufar Sadeghi; Jean-Christophe Goffard; Serge Goldman; Xavier De Tiège,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214221,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214221,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
128,SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with multiple sclerosis; A cross-sectional study,"BackgroundNeurological disability associated with multiple sclerosis and immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy which is administered for it may increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its morbidity/mortality.

ObjectiveIn this study, we evaluated the infection rate and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)

MethodsOne thousand and three hundred and sixty one MS patients from Fars province, south of Iran, were interviewed by phone from April 3 to June 20, 2020. Basic demographic data, information about MS disease and any symptoms or laboratory results relevant to COVID-19 were gathered and reviewed by treating neurologist and MS nurses. SPSS version 22 was used for data analysis.

Results68 (5%) of MS patients were suspected cases and 8 (0.58%) of all patients with positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or chest CT were in the confirmed group. 5 cases of the confirmed group needed hospitalization. Two patients died while both of them had PPMS and were taking rituximab. The frequency rate of suspected cases with RRMS was 57 (87.7%), followed by PPMS 5 (7.7%) and CIS 2(3.1%). In the confirmed group 37.5% had RRMS, 50% had PPMS, 25% use corticosteroid drug, and 50% were on rituximab. 62.5% of confirmed cases had high disability level and need assistance to walk. 36.8% of suspected and 25% of the confirmed cases were on IFN-{beta}1; eventually all of them recovered well from COVID-19 infection.

ConclusionThe present study showed that rate of developing COVID-19 in MS patients are similar to the general population and the frequency of PPMS phenotype, rituximab therapy and corticosteroid therapy were higher in the confirmed group.",Mahnaz Bayat; Alireza Fayyazpoor; Afshin Borhani Haghighi; Daniyal Salehi; Hossein Molavi Vardanjan; Maryam Poursadeghfard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214429,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214429,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
129,"LOCKDOWN FATIGUE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: PREDICTIVE ROLE OF PERSONAL RESILIENCE, COPING BEHAVIOURS, AND HEALTH","BackgroundThe lockdown measures imposed by many countries since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have been useful in slowing the transmission of the disease; however, there is growing concern regarding their adverse consequences on overall health and well-being, particularly among young people. To date, most studies have focused on the mental health consequences of the lockdown measures, while studies assessing how this disease control measure influences the occurrence of fatigue are largely absent.

AimThe aims of this study are two-fold: (a) to examine the levels of lockdown fatigue, and (2) to determine the role of coping behaviours, personal resilience, psychological well-being and perceived health in fatigue associated to the lockdown measure.

MethodsThis is an online cross-sectional study involving 243 college students in the Central Philippines during the sixth month of the lockdown measure implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Five standardised scales were used to collect the data.

ResultsOverall, college students reported moderate levels of lockdown fatigue, with a mean score of 31.54 (out of 50). Physical exhaustion or tiredness, headaches and body pain, decreased motivation and increased worry were the most pronounced manifestations of fatigue reported. Gender and college year were identified as important predictors of fatigue. Increased personal resilience and coping skills were associated with lower levels of lockdown fatigue.

ConclusionCollege students experience moderate levels of fatigue during the mandatory lockdown or home confinement period. Resilient students and those who perceive higher social support experience lower levels of fatigue during the lockdown period compared to students with low resilience and social support. Lockdown fatigue may be addressed by formulating and implementing interventions to enhance personal resilience and social support among college students.",Leodoro Labrague; Cherry Ann Ballad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20213942,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20213942,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
130,PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF CORONAPHOBIA AMONG FRONTLINE HOSPITAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES,"ObjectivesTo determine the prevalence rate as well as the predictors of coronaphobia in frontline hospital and public health nurses.

DesignThis study used a cross-sectional research study involving 736 nurses working in COVID-19 designated hospitals and health units in Region 8, Philippines. Four structured self-report scales were used, including the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire, and the single-item measure for perceived health.

ResultsThe prevalence rate of coronaphobia was 54.76% (n = 402): 37.04% (n = 130) in hospital nurses and 70.91% (n = 273) in public health nurses. Additionally, nurses gender ({beta} = 0.146, p = 0.001), marital status ({beta} = 0.101, p = 0.009), job status ({beta} = 0.132, p = 0.001), and personal resilience ({beta} = -0.154, p = 0.005) were identified as predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. A small proportion of nurses was willing (19.94%, n = 70) and fully prepared (9.40%, n = 33) to manage and care for coronavirus patients.

ConclusionCoronaphobia is prevalent among frontline Filipino nurses, particularly among public health nurses.

131,2008 financial crisis vs 2020 economic fallout: How COVID-19 might influence fertility treatment and live births,"BackgroundThe economic and reproductive medicine response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has reduced the affordability and accessibility of fertility care. We sought to determine the impact of the 2008 financial recession and the COVID-19 recession on fertility treatments and cumulative live-births.

MethodsWe examined annual US natality, CDC IVF cycle activity and live birth data from 1999 to 2018 encompassing 3,286,349 treatment cycles, to estimate the age-stratified reduction in IVF cycles undertaken after the 2008 financial recession, with forward quantitative modelling of IVF cycle activity and cumulative live-births for 2020 to 2023.

ResultsThe financial recession of 2008 caused a four-year plateau in fertility treatments with a predicted 53,026 (95% CI 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872 (95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would cause 67,386 (95% CI: 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer cycles, as compared to 4,445 (95% CI 3,144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of 40 years. This equates to overall 25,143 (95% CI: 22,408 to 27,877) fewer predicted live-births from IVF, of which only 490 (95% CI 381 to 601) are anticipated to occur in women over the age of 40 years.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 recession could have a profound impact on US IVF live-birth rates in young women, further aggravating pre-existing declines in total fertility rates.

132,Age-Stratified SARS-CoV-2 Infection Fatality Rates in New York City estimated from serological data,"ImportanceCOVID-19 has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the US and >1 million globally. Estimating the age-specific infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 for different populations is crucial for assessing the fatality of COVID-19 and for appropriately allocating limited vaccine supplies to minimize mortality.

ObjectiveTo estimate IFRs for COVID-19 in New York City and compare them to IFRs from other countries.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsWe used data from a published serosurvey of 5946 individuals 18 years or older conducted April 19-28, 2020 with time series of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths for five age-classes from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. We inferred age-specific IFRs using a Bayesian framework that accounted for the distribution of delay between infection and seroconversion and infection and death.

Main Outcome and MeasureInfection fatality rate.

ResultsWe found that IFRs increased approximately 77-fold with age, with a nearly linear increase on a log scale, from 0.07% (0.055%-0.086%) in 18-44 year olds to 5.4% (4.3%-6.3%) in individuals 75 and older. New York City IFRs were higher for 18-44 year olds and 45-64 year olds (0.58%; 0.45%-0.75%) than Spanish, English, and Swiss populations, but IFRs for 75+ year olds were lower than for English populations and similar to Spanish and Swiss populations.

Conclusions and RelevanceThese results suggest that the age-specific fatality of COVID-19 differs among developed countries and raises questions about factors underlying these differences.

133,Composition of the immunoglobulin G glycome associates with the severity of COVID-19,"A large variation in the severity of disease symptoms is one of the key open questions in COVID-19 pandemics. The fact that only a small subset of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe disease suggests that there have to be some predisposing factors, but biomarkers that reliably predict disease severity have not been found so far. Since overactivation of the immune system is implicated in a severe form of COVID-19 and the IgG glycosylation is known to be involved in the regulation of different immune processes, we evaluated the association of inter-individual variation in IgG N-glycome composition with the severity of COVID-19. The analysis of 166 severe and 167 mild cases from hospitals in Spain, Italy and Portugal revealed statistically significant differences in the composition of the IgG N-glycome. The most notable difference was the decrease in bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in severe patients from all three cohorts. IgG galactosylation was also lower in severe cases in all cohorts, but the difference in galactosylation was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.

135,CLINICAL COURSE AND OUTCOME OF COVID-19 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: DATA FROM A NATIONAL REPOSITORY,"BackgroundMortality attributable to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) 2 infection occurs mainly through the development of viral pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Research QuestionThe objective of the study is to delineate the clinical profile, predictors of disease progression, and 30-day mortality from ARDS using the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse.

Study Design and MethodsAnalysis of a historical cohort of 7,816 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020, and August 1, 2020. Main outcomes were progression to ARDS and 30-day mortality from ARDS, respectively.

ResultsThe cohort was comprised predominantly of men (94.5%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-74 years). 2,184 (28%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 643 (29.4%) were diagnosed with ARDS. The median Charlson Index was 3 (IQR 1-5). Independent predictors of progression to ARDS were body mass index (BMI)[&ge;] 40 kg/m2, diabetes, lymphocyte counts<700x109/L, LDH>450 U/L, ferritin >862 ng/ml, C-reactive protein >11 mg/dL, and D-dimer >1.5 ug/ml. In contrast, the use of an anticoagulant lowered the risk of developing ARDS (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.49-0.89]. Crude 30-day mortality rate from ARDS was 41% (95% CI 38%-45%). Risk of death from ARDS was significantly higher in those who developed acute renal failure and septic shock. Use of an anticoagulant was associated with two-fold reduction in mortality. Survival benefit was observed in patients who received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir but there was no advantage of combination therapy over either agent alone.

ConclusionsAmong those hospitalized for COVID-19, nearly one in ten progressed to ARDS. Septic shock, and acute renal failure are the leading causes of death in these patients. Treatment with either remdesivir and corticosteroids reduced the risk of mortality from ARDS.

136,Suicide Deaths during the Stay-at-Home Advisory in Massachusetts.,"Many believe that shelter-in-place or stay-at-home policies might cause an increase in so-called deaths of despair. While increases in psychiatric stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated, whether suicide rates changed during stay-at-home periods has not been described.

This was an observational cohort study that assembled suicide death data for persons aged 10 years or older from the Massachusetts Department of Health Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from January 2015 through May 2020. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA to analyze suicide deaths in Massachusetts, we compared the observed number of suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home period (March through May, 2020) in Massachusetts to the projected number of expected deaths. To be conservative, we also accounted for the deaths still pending final cause determination

The incident rate for suicide deaths in Massachusetts was 0.67 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.56-0.79) versus 0.81 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.69-0.94) during the 2019 corresponding period (incident rate ratio of 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.03). The addition of the 57 deaths pending cause determination occurring from March through May 2020 and the 33 cases still pending determination from the 2019 corresponding period did not change these findings.

The observed number of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home period did not deviate from ARIMA projected expectations using either preliminary data or an alternate scenario in which deaths pending investigation (exceeding the average remaining number of deaths still pending investigation which occurred during the corresponding 2015-2019 period) were ascribed to suicide. Decedent age and sex demographics were unchanged during the pandemic period compared to 2015-2019.

The stable rates of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts parallel findings following ecological disasters. As the pandemic persists, uncertainty about its scope and economic impact may increase. However, our data are reassuring that an increase in suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home advisory period did not occur.",Jeremy Faust; Sejal B Shah; Chengan Du; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Harlan M Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215343,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215343,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

138,"Evaluating the use of the reproduction number as an epidemiological tool, using spatio-temporal trends of the Covid-19 outbreak in England","The time-varying reproduction number (Rt: the average number secondary infections caused by each infected person) may be used to assess changes in transmission potential during an epidemic. Since new infections usually are not observed directly, it can only be estimated from delayed and potentially biased data. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to observed test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with confirmed Covid-19, in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We explored the sensitivity of Rt estimates of Covid-19 in England to different data sources, and investigated the potential of using differences in the estimates to track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups.

Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source. The divergence between estimates from each source was not consistent within or across regions over time, although estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than compared to estimates from all test-positives. We compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of transmission, and found the differences between Rt may be linked to biased representations of sub-populations in each data source: from uneven testing rates, or increasing severity of disease with age, seen via outbreaks in care home populations and changing age distributions of cases.

We highlight that policy makers should consider the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.",Katharine Sherratt; Sam Abbott; Sophie Meakin; Joel Hellewell; James D Munday; Nikos Bosse; - CMMID Covid-19 working group; Mark Jit; Sebastian Funk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214585,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214585,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
139,"Evaluation of Nowcasting for Real-Time COVID-19 Tracking - New York City, March-May 2020","To account for delays between specimen collection and report, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene used a time-correlated Bayesian nowcasting approach to support real-time COVID-19 situational awareness. We retrospectively evaluated nowcasting performance for case counts among residents diagnosed during March-May 2020, a period when the median reporting delay was 2 days. Nowcasts with a 2-week moving window and a negative binomial distribution had lower mean absolute error, lower relative root mean square error, and higher 95% prediction interval coverage than nowcasts conducted with a 3-week moving window or with a Poisson distribution. Nowcasts conducted toward the end of the week outperformed nowcasts performed earlier in the week, given fewer patients diagnosed on weekends and lack of day-of-week adjustments. When estimating case counts for weekdays only, metrics were similar across days the nowcasts were conducted, with Mondays having the lowest mean absolute error, of 183 cases in the context of an average daily weekday case count of 2,914. Nowcasting ensured that recent decreases in observed case counts were not overinterpreted as true declines and supported health department leadership in anticipating the magnitude and timing of hospitalizations and deaths and allocating resources geographically.",Sharon K.

140,Real-life validation of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Abbott) in community-dwelling subjects with symptoms of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundRT-qPCR is the reference test for identification of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is associated with diagnostic delay. Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20 minutes and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life settings has not been determined.

MethodsThe diagnostic value of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs.

Findings1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n=139) and 30.3% (n=63) in Utrecht and Aruba respectively. Specificity of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7-100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0-89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms. Restricting RT-qPCR test positivity to Ct-values <32 yielded test sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI: 89.3-98.5%) in the Netherlands and 98.0% (95%CI: 89.2-99.95%) in Aruba.

InterpretationIn community-dwelling subjects with mild respiratory symptoms the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had 100% specificity, and a sensitivity above 95% for nasopharyngeal samples when using Ct values <32 cycles as cut-off for RT-qPCR test positivity. Considering short turnaround times, user friendliness, low costs and opportunities for decentralized testing, this test can improve our efforts to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Based on the advantages of using zebrafish as a model in research, herein we suggest doing this to test the safety of the putative vaccine candidates and to study immune response against the virus. We produced a recombinant N-terminal fraction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and injected it into adult female zebrafish. The specimens generated humoral immunity and passed the antibodies to the eggs. However, they presented adverse reactions and inflammatory responses similar to severe cases of human COVID-19. The analysis of the structure and function of zebrafish and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the main human receptor for virus infection, presented remarkable sequence similarities. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis predicted protein-protein interaction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 fragment and the Toll-like receptor pathway. It might help in the choice of future therapeutic pharmaceutical drugs to be studied. Based on the in vivo and in silico results presented here, we propose the zebrafish as a model for translational research into the safety of the vaccine and the immune response of the vertebrate organism to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Bianca H Ventura Fernandes; Natalia Martins Feitosa; Ana Paula Barbosa; Camila Gasque Bomfim; Anali MB Garnique; Francisco IF Gomes; Rafael T Nakajima; Marco AA Belo; Silas Fernandes Eto; Dayanne Carla Fernandes; Guilherme Malafaia; Wilson G Manrique; Gabriel Conde; Roberta RC Rosales; Iris Todeschini; Ilo Rivero; Edgar Llontop; German G Sgro; Gabriel Umaji Oka; Natalia Fernanda Bueno; Fausto K Ferraris; Mariana TQ de Magalhaes; Renata J Medeiros; Juliana MM Gomes; Mara Souza Junqueira; Katia Conceicao; Leticia G.

143,Isolation of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against divergent human coronaviruses that delineate a conserved and vulnerable site on the spike protein,"The coronavirus spike glycoprotein, located on the virion surface, is the key mediator of cell entry. As such, it is an attractive target for the development of protective antibodies and vaccines. Here we describe two human monoclonal antibodies, 1.6C7 and 28D9, that display a remarkable cross-reactivity against distinct species from three Betacoronavirus subgenera, capable of binding the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Both antibodies, derived from immunized transgenic mice carrying a human immunoglobulin repertoire, blocked MERS-CoV infection in cells, whereas 28D9 also showed weak cross-neutralizing potential against HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a neutralization-sensitive virus pseudotyping system, but not against authentic virus. Both cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies were found to target the stem helix in the spike protein S2 fusion subunit which, in the prefusion conformation of trimeric spike, forms a surface exposed membrane-proximal helical bundle, that is antibody-accessible. We demonstrate that administration of these antibodies in mice protects from a lethal MERS-CoV challenge in both prophylactic and/or therapeutic models. Collectively, these antibodies delineate a conserved, immunogenic and vulnerabe site on the spike protein which spurs the development of broad-range diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures against coronaviruses.",Chunyan Wang; Rien van Haperen; Javier Gutierrez-Alvarez; Wentao Li; Nisreen Okba; Irina Albulescu; Ivy Widjaja; Brenda van Dieren; Raul Fernandez-Delgado; Isabel Sola; Daniel Hurdiss; Olalekan Daramola; Frank Grosveld; Frank van Kuppeveld; Bart Haagmans; Luis Enjuanes; Dubravka Drabek; Berend-Jan Bosch,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346916,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346916,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,False
144,High-throughput detection of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in longitudinal convalescent plasma samples,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than a million deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection.

Study Design and MethodsTo extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors.

Results and ConclusionWe found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations, but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.",Sai Priya Anand; Jeremie Prevost; Jonathan Richard; Josee Perreault; Tony Tremblay; Mathieu Drouin; Marie-Josee Fournier; Antoine Lewin; Renee Bazin; Andres Finzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346783,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346783,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,False
145,Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals dysregulation of molecular programs associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity and outcomes in patients with chronic lung disease,"RationalePatients with chronic lung disease have an increased risk for severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and poor outcomes.

ObjectivesTo identify molecular characteristics of diseased lung epithelial and immune cells that may account for worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic lung diseases.

MethodsWe analyzed the transcriptomes of 605,904 single cells isolated from healthy (79 samples) and diseased human lungs (31 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 82 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 18 non-IPF interstitial lung disease samples).

Measurements and Main ResultsCellular distribution and relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, TMPRSS2) was similar in disease and control lungs. Epithelial cells isolated from diseased lungs expressed higher levels of genes linked directly to efficiency of viral replication and the innate immune response. Unique ACE2-correlated gene sets were identified for each diagnosis group in the type II alveolar cells. Diseased lungs have a significant increase in the proportion of CD4, CD8 and NK cells compared to control lungs. Components of the interferon pathway, the IL6 cytokine pathway and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are upregulated in several diseased immune cell types. These differences in inflammatory gene expression programs highlight how chronic lung disease alters the inflammatory microenvironment encountered upon viral exposure to the peripheral lung.

ConclusionsChronic lung disease is accompanied by changes in cell-type-specific gene expression programs that prime the lung epithelium for and influence innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Linh T.

146,Impact of clade specific mutations on structural fidelity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins,"The SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a genome size of ~29.9 kilobase pairs which spans 29 open reading frames. Studies have revealed that the genome encodes about 16 non-structural proteins (nsp), four structural proteins, and six or seven accessory proteins. Based on prevalent knowledge on SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, functions have been assigned for majority of the proteins. While, researchers across the globe are engrossed in identifying a potential pharmacological intervention to control the viral outbreak, none of the work has come up with new antiviral drugs or vaccines yet. One possible approach that has shown some positive results is by treating infected patients with the plasma collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Several vaccines around the world have entered their final trial phase in humans and we expect that these will in time be available for application to worldwide population to combat the disease. In this work we analyse the effect of prevalent mutations in the major pathogenesis related proteins of SARS-COV2 and attempt to pinpoint the effects of those mutations on the structural stability of the proteins. Our observations and analysis direct us to identify that all the major mutations have a negative impact in context of stability of the viral proteins under study and the mutant proteins suffer both structural and functional alterations as a result of the mutations. Our binary scoring scheme identifies L84S mutation in ORF8 as the most disruptive of the mutations under study. We believe that, the virus is under the influence of an evolutionary phenomenon similar to Mullers ratchet where the continuous accumulation of these mutations is making the virus less virulent which may also explain the reduction in fatality rates worldwide.",Souradip Basu; Suparba Mukhopadhyay; Rajdeep Das; Sarmishta Mukhopadhyay; Pankaj Kumar Singh,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347021,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347021,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,False
147,Viral surface geometry shapes influenza and coronavirus spike evolution,"The evolution of circulating viruses is shaped by their need to evade the adaptive immune system. The spike protein which mediates entry to the host cell is the main target of antibody response. Because of the dense presentation of spikes on the viral surface, not all antigenic sites are targeted equally by antibodies, leading to complex immunodominance patterns. We used 3D coarse-grained computational models to estimate the antibody pressure on the seasonal flu H1N1 and the SARS subgenus spikes. Analyzing publically available sequences, we show that antibody pressure, through the geometrical organization of these spikes on the viral surface, shaped their mutability. Studying the mutability patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic spikes, we find that they are not predominantly shaped by antibody pressure. However, for SARS-CoV-2, we find that over time, it acquired, at low frequency, several mutations at antibody-accessible positions, which could indicate possible escape as define by our model. Hence, we offer a geometry-based approach to estimate and assess whether a pandemic virus is changing its mutational pattern to that indicative of a circulating virus.",Assaf Amitai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347641,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347641,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,False

Here, we conducted longitudinal, high-dimensional profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19, revealing immune processes in the respiratory tract linked to disease pathogenesis. Survival from severe disease was associated with increased CD4+T cells and decreased monocyte/macrophage frequencies in the airway, but not in blood. Airway T cells and macrophages exhibited tissue-resident phenotypes and activation signatures, including high level expression and secretion of monocyte chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL3 by airway macrophages. By contrast, monocytes in blood expressed the CCL2-receptor CCR2 and aberrant CD163+ and immature phenotypes. Extensive accumulation of CD163+monocyte/macrophages within alveolar spaces in COVID-19 lung autopsies suggested recruitment from circulation.

149,Development and pre-clinical characterization of two therapeutic equine formulations towards SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the potential treatment of COVID-19,"In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials.

Here we present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria through 5 leader and 3UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and activate the EGR1 pathway. Mitochondrial-targeted drugs such as lonidamine and polydatin significantly repress rare codon-driven gene expression and viral replication. This study identifies an unreported viral protein translation mechanism and opens up a novel avenue for developing antiviral drugs.

Nucleoside analogues, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against the newly emerging viral diseases. Recent clinical trials of these two drugs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment revealed antiviral efficacies as well as side effects with different extents1-4. As a pyrazine derivative, Favipiravir could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides, which may further lead to mutations in progeny RNA copies due to the non-conserved base-pairing capacity5. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues which may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides.

152,SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through the air between ferrets over more than one meter distance,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, whereas the closely related SARS-CoV was contained rapidly in 2003. Here, a newly developed experimental set-up was used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses caused a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmitted efficiently. Serological assays confirmed all virus transmission events. Although the experiments did not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while travelling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms.

Herein the mutational status of 611 genomes from India along with their impact on proteins was ascertained. After excluding gaps and ambiguous sequences, a total of 493 variable sites (152 parsimony informative and 341 singleton) were observed. The most prevalent reference nucleotide was C (209) and substituted one was T (293). NSP3 had the highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74 sites), NSP12b (43 sites) and ORF3a (31 sites).

155,"COVID-19: Variant screening, an important step towards precision epidemiology","Precision epidemiology using genomic technologies allows for a more targeted approach to COVID-19 control and treatment at individual and population level, and is the urgent need of the day. It enables identification of patients who may be at higher risk than others to COVID-19-related mortality, due to their genetic architecture, or who might respond better to a COVID-19 treatment. The COVID-19 virus, similar to SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral S protein priming. This study aspires to present a multi-omics view of how variations in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes affect COVID-19 infection and disease progression in affected individuals. It reports, for both genes, several variant and gene expression analysis findings, through (i) comparison analysis over single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that may account for the difference of COVID-19 manifestations among global sub-populations; (ii) calculating prevalence of structural variations (copy number variations (CNVs) / insertions), amongst populations; and (iii) studying expression patterns stratified by gender and age, over all human tissues.

156,Diversity and genomic determinants of the microbiomes associated with COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging and highly transmissible disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the microbiomes associated with the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 diseases has clinical interest. We hypothesized that the diversity of microbiome compositions and their genomic features are associated with different pathological conditions of these human respiratory tract diseases (COVID-19 and non-COVID; URTI and COPD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 21 whole metagenome sequences (WMS) including eleven COVID-19 (BD = 6 and China = 5), six COPD (UK = 6) and four URTI (USA = 4) samples to unravel the diversity of microbiomes, their genomic features and relevant metabolic functions. The WMS data mapped to 534 bacterial, 60 archaeal and 61 viral genomes with distinct variation in the microbiome composition across the samples (COVID-19>COPD>URTI). Notably, 94.57%, 80.0% and 24.59% bacterial, archaeal and viral genera shared between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples, respectively, however, the COVID-19 related samples had sole association with 16 viral genera other than SARS-CoV-2. Strain-level virome profiling revealed 660 and 729 strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID sequence data, respectively and of them 34.50% strains shared between the conditions. Functional annotation of metagenomics sequences of thevCOVID-19 and non-COVID groups identified the association of several biochemical pathways related to basic metabolism (amino acid and energy), ABC transporters, membrane transport, replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems, virulence, disease and defense, adhesion, regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and primary immunodeficiency. We also detected 30 functional gene groups/classes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (RATC) in both COVID-19 and non-COVID microbiomes. Furthermore, a predominant higher abundance of cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance (CZCR) and multidrug resistance to efflux pumps (MREP) genes were detected in COVID-19 metagenome. The profiles of microbiome diversity and associated microbial genomic features found in both COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI) samples might be helpful for developing the microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases. However, future studies might be carried out to explore the microbiome dynamics and the cross-talk between host and microbiomes employing larger volume of samples from different ethnic groups and geoclimatic conditions.",M.

157,An engineered decoy receptor for SARS-CoV-2 broadly binds protein S sequence variants,"The spike S of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 on the host cell membrane to initiate entry. Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, due to close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find an engineered decoy receptor, sACE22.v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.",Kui K Chan; Timothy JC Tan; Krishna K Narayanan; Erik Procko,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.344622,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.344622,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False

We used flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing to understand how the heterogeneity of this diverse cell population contributes to elements of viral tropism and pathogenesis, antiviral immunity, and treatment response to remdesivir. We found that, while a variety of epithelial cell types are susceptible to infection, ciliated cells are the predominant cell target of SARS-CoV-2. The host protease TMPRSS2 was required for infection of these cells. Importantly, remdesivir treatment effectively inhibited viral replication across cell types, and blunted hyperinflammatory responses. Induction of interferon responses within infected cells was rare and there was significant heterogeneity in the antiviral gene signatures, varying with the burden of infection in each cell.

159,COVID-19 In a Rural Health System in New York - Case Series and an Approach to Management,"BackgroundMany rural hospitals and health systems in the U.S. lack sufficient resources to treat COVID-19. We developed a system for managing inpatient COVID-19 hospital admissions in St. Lawrence County, an underserved rural county which is the largest county in New York State.

MethodsWe used a hub and spoke system to route COVID-19 patients in the St. Lawrence Health System to its flagship hospital. We assembled a small clinical team to manage admitted COVID-19 patients and to stay abreast of a quickly changing body of literature and standard of care. We subsequently completed a review of clinical data for patients who were treated by our inpatient COVID-19 treatment team between March 20 and May 22, 2020.

ResultsTwenty COVID-19 patients were identified. Sixteen patients (80%) met NIH criteria for severe or critical disease. One patient died. No patients were transferred to other hospitals.

ConclusionsDuring the first two months of the pandemic, we were able to manage hospitalized COVID-19 patients in our rural community.

160,"Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge","BackgroundThe medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood.

MethodsFifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments.

FindingsAt 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and a significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls.

InterpretationA significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.

161,"HIV testing by public health centers and municipalities, and new HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, medical resources were primarily allocated to COVID-19, which might have reduced facility capacity for HIV testing. Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and its consequences in Japan.

MethodsWe analysed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations that public health centers received, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the same analysis for two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese.

FindingsThe number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases (36{middle dot}2% vs. 26{middle dot}4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. The number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis numerically decreased (166 vs. 217), although the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trend for the MSM and non-Japanese groups.

InterpretationThe current HIV testing system including public health centers misses more HIV cases at the early phase of the infection during the pandemic. Given that the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the pandemic is still uncertain, continuously monitoring the situation as well as securing sufficient test resources using self-test is essential.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSBefore this study, we searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar on Oct 12, 2020, for articles investigated the number of HIV test and HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, using the search terms ""novel coronavirus"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"", and ""HIV"" or ""AIDS"", and ""Japan"", with no time restrictions. We found no published work relevant to our study.

Added value of this studyDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the public health centers and municipalities temporarily suspended facility-based HIV testing to concentrate their limited resources to COVID-19 testing. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of HIV tests in public health centers and municipalities, and on the number of HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. We confirmed that the number of the test declined in the second quarter (April to June) of 2020, and the proportion of HIV with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases increased during the same period.

Implications of all the available evidenceProviding sufficient HIV testing opportunities even during the pandemic, when facility-based testing is challenging, is necessary for better clinical and public health outcomes. Self-testing and home specimen collection (e.g. dried blood spot or oral fluid test) could be a key to fill the gap between the need for HIV testing and the constraints related to the COVID-19 outbreak.",Keisuke Ejima; Yoshiki Koizumi; Nao Yamamoto; Molly Rosenberg; Christina Ludema; Ana I Bento; Daisuke Yoneoka; Seiichi Ichikawa; Daisuke Mizushima; Shingo Iwami,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213959,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213959,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True

We aimed to investigate whether white blood cell traits have potential causal effects on severe COVID-19 using Mendelian randomization (MR).

MethodsTo evaluate the causal associations between various white blood cell traits and severe COVID-19, we conducted a two-sample MR analysis with summary statistics from recent large genome-wide association studies.

ResultsOur MR results indicated potential causal associations of white blood cell count, myeloid white blood cell count, and granulocyte count with severe COVID-19, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.98), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.70-0.94), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.99), respectively. Increasing eosinophil percentage of white blood cells was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.45).

165,Tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the wastewater treatment process,"The municipal sewage carries the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), shed by COVID-19 patients, to wastewater treatment plants. Proper wastewater treatment can provide an important barrier for preventing uncontrolled discharged of the virus into the environment. However, the role of the different wastewater treatment stages in reducing virus concentrations was, thus far, unknown. In this work, we quantified SARS-CoV-RNA in the raw sewage and along the main stages of the wastewater process from two different plants in Israel during this COVID-19 outbreak. We found that ca. 2 Log removal could be attained after primary and secondary treatment. Despite this removal, significant concentrations of SARS-CoV-RNA (>100 copies per mL) could still be detected in the treated wastewater. However, after treatment by chlorination, SARS-CoV-RNA was detected only once, likely due to insufficient chlorine dose. Our results highlight the need to protect wastewater treatment plants operators, as well as populations living near areas of wastewater discharge, from the risk of infection.

Does professionalism improve their response to a public crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic? Collecting resumes of government and Party officials in almost all prefectural Chinese cities, and matching with other data sources, including weather conditions, city characteristics, COVID-19-related policies, and health outcomes, we demonstrate that cities whose top officials had PHMBGs witnessed significantly lower infection rates, and often lower death rates, than cities whose top officials lacked such backgrounds.

167,Melatonin is significantly associated with survival of intubated COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundRespiratory distress requiring intubation is the most serious complication associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we used survival analysis to determine whether or not mortality following intubation was associated with hormone exposure in patients treated at New York Presbyterian/ Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Here, we report the overall hazards ratio for each hormone for exposure before and after intubation for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.

ResultsAmong the 189,987 patients, we identified 948 intubation periods across 791 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or infected with SARS-CoV2 and 3,497 intubation periods across 2,981 patients who were not. Melatonin exposure after intubation was statistically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.131, 95% CI: 7.76E-02 - 0.223, p-value = 8.19E-14) and non-COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.278, 95% CI: 0.142 - 0.542, p-value = 1.72E-04) intubated patients. Additionally, melatonin exposure after intubation was statically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 patients (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.127, 95% CI: 6.01E-02 - 0.269, p-value = 7.15E-08).

ConclusionsMelatonin exposure after intubation is significantly associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, melatonin exposure after intubation is significantly associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

168,Modelling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a UK university setting,"BackgroundThe higher education system in the United Kingdom comprises a large student population. Around 40% of school leavers attend university and individual universities generally host thousands of students each academic year. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing together these student communities presents questions regarding the strength of interventions required to control transmission. Prior modelling analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within universities has usually adopted a compartmental modelling approach, whose projections suggest an almost inevitable likelihood of outbreaks.

MethodsWe constructed a network-based model to capture the interactions of a student population in different settings (housing, social and study). For a representative campus-based university, we ran a susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered type epidemic process, parameterised according to available estimates for SARS-CoV-2. Over the course of a single academic term, we investigated the impact on infection control of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation, test and trace measures, the additional use of room isolation as an intervention and supplementary mass testing.

ResultsIncorporating uncertainty in the fraction of cases that are asymptomatic and their associated infectivity, in the absence of interventions our model estimated that 16% (2% - 38%) of the student population could be infected during the autumn term. In contrast, with full adherence to isolation measures and engagement with test-and-trace, predictions of the cumulative infection count were lower, 1.4% (0.4% - 5%). Irrespective of the adherence to isolation measures, on average a higher proportion of students resident on-campus became infected compared with students resident off-campus. Widespread adherence of interventions led to reductions in the average fraction of time those individuals adhering to measures were expected to be isolated, with room isolation as an additional intervention generating minimal benefits. The model found that a one-off instance of mass testing would not drastically reduce the term-long case load or end-of-term prevalence, but regular weekly or fortnightly testing could reduce both measures by more than 50% (compared to having no mass testing).

ConclusionsOur findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 may readily transmit amongst a student population within a university setting if there is limited adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions and there are delays present in receiving test results. Following isolation guidance and effective contact tracing both curbed transmission and reduced the expected time an adhering student would spend in isolation. Additionally, widespread adherence throughout the term suppresses the amount of unwitting asymptomatic transmission to family and community members in the students domicile regions at the end of term.",Edward M Hill; Benjamin D Atkins; Matt J Keeling; Michael Tildesley; Louise Dyson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20208454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20208454,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True

ObjectiveTo evaluate factors predicting severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR) SARS-COV-2 (severe acute coronavirus-2) reinfection.

MethodWe conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico and data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-COV-2 infection.

ResultsThe risk of severe disease was 14.7% and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38] and previous severe laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39).

ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating disease outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection and factors associated with illness severity was characterized.

170,Aging and COVID-19 mortality: A demographic perspective,"Demographers were among the first to emphasize the importance of age in explaining the spread and impact on mortality of COVID-19. Yet, the relationship between age and COVID-19 is not fully understood. This study aims to answer the following questions: Do COVID-19 deaths follow the Gompertz force of mortality? How does the relationship between age and COVID-19 mortality compare with other major causes of death? Does this relationship vary between countries? Using US vital Statistics, COVID-19 mortality doubling time is compared with 68 major cause of death categories. COVID-19 fatality is similarly compared across 33 countries using COVerAGE-DB, a harmonized dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Several findings are supported by the evidence. First, COVID-19 mortality increasing exponentially with age at a rate near the median of aging-related causes of death, as well as pneumonia and influenza. Second, COVID-19 mortality levels in the US are currently 4 to 8 times higher than pneumonia and influenza across the adult age range. Third, the relationship between COVID-19 fatality and age varies considerably across high-income countries.

171,National Routine Adult Immunization Programs among World Health Organization Member States: An Assessment of Health Systems to Deploy Future SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines,"IntroductionAs the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disproportionately affects older adults, future pandemic vaccine response will rely on existing adult immunization infrastructures.

MethodsWe evaluated the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization for country reports on adult immunization programs. We described countries with programs and used multivariable regression to identify independent factors associated with having them.

ResultsOf 194 WHO Member States, 120 (62%) reported having any adult vaccination program. The Americas and Europe had the most adult immunization programs, most commonly Hepatitis B and influenza vaccines (>45% and >90% of countries). Africa and South-East Asia had the fewest adult immunization programs, with <11% of countries reporting any adult immunization programs for influenza or hepatitis vaccines, and none for pneumococcal vaccines. In bivariate analyses, high- or upper-middle income, introduction of new or underused vaccines, having achieved pediatric vaccine coverage goals, and meeting National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups basic functional indicators were significantly associated (p<0.001) with having any adult immunization programs. In multivariable analyses, the factor most strongly associated with adult immunization programs was country income, with high- or upper-middle income countries significantly more likely to report having a program (aOR 19.3, 95% CI 6.5, 57.7).

DiscussionThat 38% of countries lack functional platforms for adult immunization has major implications for future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine deployment. Systems for vaccine storage and handling, delivery, and waste management for adult immunization do not exist in much of the world. Developing countries should strengthen immunization programs to reach adults with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines when they become available.",Sarah R Williams; Amanda J Driscoll; Hanna M LeBuhn; Wilbur H Chen; Kathleen M Neuzil; Justin R Ortiz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213967,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213967,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True

173,3D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets emphasizes focal infection pattern in the upper respiratory tract,"The visualization of viral pathogens in infected tissues is an invaluable tool to understand spatial virus distribution, localization, and cell tropism in vivo. Commonly, virus-infected tissues are analyzed using conventional immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded thin sections. Here, we demonstrate the utility of volumetric three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging using tissue optical clearing and light sheet microscopy to investigate host-pathogen interactions of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets at a mesoscopic scale. The superior spatial context of large, intact samples (> 150 mm3) allowed detailed quantification of interrelated parameters like focus-to-focus distance or SARS-CoV-2-infected area, facilitating an in-depth description of SARS-CoV-2 infection foci. Accordingly, we could confirm a preferential infection of the ferret upper respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 and emphasize a distinct focal infection pattern in nasal turbinates. Conclusively, we present a proof-of-concept study for investigating critically important respiratory pathogens in their spatial tissue morphology and demonstrate the first specific 3D visualization of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Luca M.

174,Adult Stem Cell-derived Complete Lung Organoid Models Emulate Lung Disease in COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, causes widespread damage in the lungs in the setting of an overzealous immune response whose origin remains unclear. We present a scalable, propagable, personalized, cost-effective adult stem cell-derived human lung organoid model that is complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia. Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived alveolar type-II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19. Infected ALO-monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection, whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2[-&gt;]AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both. Findings validate a human lung model of COVID-19, which can be immediately utilized to investigate COVID-19 pathogenesis and vet new therapies and vaccines.

175,Molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by temperature,"Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be inactivated by effect of heat, even though, little is known about the molecular changes induced by the temperature. Here, we unravel the basics of such inactivation mechanism over the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by executing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Both the closed down and open up states, which determine the accessibility to the receptor binding domain, were considered. Results suggest that the spike undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bond network while salt bridges are mainly preserved. Reorganization in the hydrogen bonds structure produces conformational variations in the receptor binding subunit and explain the thermal inactivation of the virus. Conversely, the macrostructure of the spike is preserved at high temperature because of the retained salt bridges. The proposed mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Didac Marti; Joan Torras; Oscar Bertran; Pau Turon; Carlos Aleman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.343459,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.343459,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,False
176,"Structure, Dynamics, Receptor Binding, and Antibody Binding of Fully-glycosylated Full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in a Viral Membrane","The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates host cell entry by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and is considered the major target for drug and vaccine development. We previously built fully-glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple s-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of S protein, and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of RBD, and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of a commonly-used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibody. Overall, our observations offer structural and dynamic insight into SARS-CoV-2 S protein and potentialize for guiding the design of effective antiviral therapeutics.",Yeol Kyo Choi; Yiwei Cao; Martin Frank; Hyeonuk Woo; Sang-Jun Park; Min Sun Yeom; Tristan I.

177,Ongoing Adaptive Evolution and Globalization of Sars-Cov-2,"Unprecedented sequencing efforts have, as of October 2020, produced over 100,000 genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is paramount to control the pandemic. Although this extensive data availability quickly facilitated the development of vaccine candidates1, major challenges in the analysis of this enormous dataset persist, limiting the ability of public health officials to translate science into policy. Having evolved over a short period of time, the SARS-CoV-2 isolates show low diversity, necessitating analysis of trees built from genome-scale data. Here we provide a complete ancestral genome reconstruction for SARS-CoV-2 leveraging Fitch Traceback2. We show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection. However, a small set of sites, including the extensively studied spike 6143, harbor mutations which recurred on multiple, independent occasions, indicative of positive selection. These mutations form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions. The phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 7 major clades which show distinct global and temporal dynamics. Periods of regional diversification of SARS-CoV-2 are short and, despite dramatically reduced travel4, globalization of the virus is apparent.",Nash D Rochman; Yuri I.

179,TREATMENT PROFILES AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 PATIENTS AT PRIVATE HOSPITAL IN JAKARTA,"BackgroundSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes COVID-19, which has become a worldwide pandemic. However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19.

ObjectivesTo find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion.

ResultsThe survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment for about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients.

180,Recovery of monocyte exhaustion is associated with resolution of lung injury in COVID-19 convalescence.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection resulting in the clinical syndrome COVID-19 is associated with an exaggerated immune response and monocyte infiltrates in the lungs and other peripheral tissues. It is now increasingly recognised that chronic morbidity persists in some patients. We recently demonstrated profound alterations of monocytes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. It is currently unclear whether these abnormalities resolve or progress following patient discharge. We show here that blood monocytes in convalescent patients at their 12 week follow up, have a greater propensity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6, which was consistently higher in patients with resolution of lung injury as indicated by a normal chest X-ray and no shortness of breath (a key symptom of lung injury). Furthermore, monocytes from convalescent patients also displayed enhanced levels of molecules involved in leucocyte migration, including chemokine receptor CXCR6, adhesion molecule CD31/PECAM and integrins VLA-4 and LFA-1. Expression of migration molecules on monocytes was also consistently higher in convalescent patients with a normal chest X-ray. These data suggest persistent changes in innate immune function following recovery from COVID-19 and indicate that immune modulating therapies targeting monocytes and leucocyte migration may be useful in recovering COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms.",Nicholas A Scott; Sean Blandin Knight; Laurence Pearmain; Oliver Brand; David J Morgan; Chris Jagger; Saba Khan; Pamela Hackney; Lara Smith; Madhvi Menon; Joanne Konkel; Halima A Shuwa; Miriam Franklin; Verena Kaestele; Sarah Harbach; Seema Brij; Andrew Ustianowski; Alison Uriel; Gabriella Lindergard; Nawar Diar Bakerly; Paul Dark; Alexander Mathioudakis; Kathryn Gray; Graham Lord; Timothy Felton; Chris Brightling; Ling-Pei Ho; - NIHR Respiratory TRC; - CIRCO; Karen Piper Hanley; Angela Simpson; John R Grainger; Tracy Hussell; Elizabeth R Mann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20207449,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20207449,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
181,sMAdCAM:IL-6 (sMIL Index): A novel signature associated with COVID-19 disease progression and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"IMPORTANCERecent studies positing the gut as a sanctuary site for viral persistence in SARS-CoV-2 infection highlight the importance of assimilating profiles of systemic as well as gut inflammatory mediators to understand the pathology of COVID-19. Also, the role of these markers in governing virus specific immunity following infection remains largely unexplored.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the role of systemic and gut inflammatory markers in disease progression and development of anti-viral humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTSThis cohort study (n=58) of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals included a group of in-patients (n=36) at various stages of disease progression together with convalescent individuals (n=22) recruited between April and June 2020 (peak of the epidemic) from a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 11 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out, resulting in a total of 47 in-patient samples.

EXPOSURESDiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based testing of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPrimary outcomes were the measurement of inflammatory markers including Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and levels of soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) in plasma. Anti-viral humoral response was measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (IgG). Also antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Secondary outcomes were correlation of the inflammatory signature with clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration and co-morbidities.

RESULTSTwenty eight of 36 (78%) in-patients and 19 of 22 (86%) convalescents were males. Out of 47 in-patient samples, 22 (46%), 11 (23%) and 14 (30%) were IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-respectively. Of 22 convalescent samples, 3 (14%), 1 (4%) and 17 (77%) were respectively IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-. Two out of 22 (9%) convalescents showed high IL-6 levels (>100pg/ml) and 4 (18%) had high TNF levels (>30pg/ml). However, the convalescents (n =22) had significantly lower levels of IL-6 [Median=27.48 (IQR=23.54-39.92)] compared to followed up in-patients (n = 11) at day 0 [Median=111(IQR=68-129.7), p =0.0002] and higher levels of sMAdCAM [Median=1940 (1711-2174) pg/ml] compared to these individuals at day 0 [Median=1701 (IQR=1532-1836) pg/ml; p=0.032] and day 7 [Median=1534 (IQR=1236-1654) pg/ml; p=0.0007]. Further, IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients inversely correlated with one another (r = -0.374, p = 0.009, CI = 95%). When expressed as a novel integrated marker -sMIL (sMAdCAM/IL-6 ratio) index, these levels were incrementally and significantly higher across various disease states with convalescents exhibiting the highest values [Median= 64.74 (IQR=47.33-85.58)]. Also, the sMIL index was significantly higher in convalescents (with class-switched responses) compared to IgG+/IgM+ individuals at early stages of infection [Median=28.65 (IQR=13.63-96.26), p = 0.034]. Real-time measurement by SPR of plasma antibody binding to viral nucleocapsid (NC), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) revealed waxing and waning of plasma antibody responses to all 3 targets. Importantly, sMAdCAM levels as well as sMIL index (fold change) correlated with peak association rates of RBD-binding (r = 0.462, p = 0.03, CI = 95%) and fold change in binding to S (r = 0.68, p = 0.050, CI = 95%) respectively.

CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCEOur results highlight key systemic and gut-associated immune parameters that need to be monitored and investigated further to optimally guide therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for COVID-19.

182,SARS-CoV-2 S protein ACE2 interaction reveals novel allosteric targets,"The Spike (S) protein is the main handle for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells through surface ACE2 receptors. How ACE2 binding activates proteolysis of S protein is unknown. Here, we have mapped the S:ACE2 interface and uncovered long-range allosteric propagation of ACE2 binding to sites critical for viral host entry. Unexpectedly, ACE2 binding enhances dynamics at a distal S1/S2 cleavage site and flanking protease docking site ~27 [A] away while dampening dynamics of the stalk hinge (central helix and heptad repeat) regions ~ 130 [A] away. This highlights that the stalk and proteolysis sites of the S protein are dynamic hotspots in the pre-fusion state. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for S:ACE2 complex formation, critical for proteolytic processing and viral-host membrane fusion and highlight protease docking sites flanking the S1/S2 cleavage site, fusion peptide and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) as allosterically exposed cryptic hotspots for potential therapeutic development.

Therefore, it is important to develop methods that will ensure that the COVID vaccine is allocated to the people who are at major risk until there is a sufficient global supply. Herein, I developed a machine-learning tool that could be applied to assess the risk in communities based on social, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. As a ""proof of concept,"" I modeled COVID risk in the Massachusetts communities using 29 risk factors, including the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions like COPD and social factors such as racial composition.

184,Analysis of Collective Response Reveals that COVID-19-Related Activities Start From the End of 2019 in Mainland China,"While the COVID-19 outbreak is making an impact at a global scale, the collective response to the pandemic becomes the key to analyzing past situations, evaluating current measures, and formulating future predictions. In this paper, we analyze the public reactions to the pandemic using search engine data and mobility data from Baidu Search and Baidu Maps respectively, where we particularly pay attentions to the early stage of pandemics and find early signals from the collective response to COVID-19. First, we correlate the number of confirmed cases per day to daily search queries of a large number of keywords through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA), where the keywords top in the most critical days are believed the most relevant to the pandemic. We then categorize the ranking lists of keywords according to the specific regions of the search, such as Wuhan, Mainland China, the USA, and the whole world. Through the analysis on search, we succeed in identifying COVID-19 related collective response would not be earlier than the end of 2019 in Mainland China. Finally, we confirm this observation again using human mobility data, where we specifically compare the massive mobility traces, including the real-time population densities inside key hospitals and inter-city travels departing from/arriving in Wuhan, from 2018 to 2020.

185,Understanding the value of clinical symptoms of COVID-19. A logistic regression model,"BackgroundThe new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is responsible for the current pandemic outbreak worldwide. However, there is limited information regarding the set of specific symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the main symptoms associated with COVID-19 to aid in the clinical diagnosis for the rapid identification of cases.

Methods and findingsA cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers. A total of 67318 individuals were included in this study, where 12% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population was divided in two age groups, a group aged 0 to 55 years-old (<56 group), (median = 32, n=48748) and another group aged 56 to 103 years-old ([&ge;]56 group) (median =72, n=18570). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that out of a total of 23 symptoms, only five were found to have a positive association with COVID-19: anosmia (odds ratio [OR] 10.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.20-13.10, <56 group; OR 6.09 CI 3.05-12.20, [&ge;]56 group) dysgeusia (OR 3.67, CI 2.7-4.9, <56 group; OR 3.53 CI 1.52-8.18, [&ge;]56 group), low grade fever (37.5-37.9{degrees} C) (OR 1.61, CI 1.20-2.05, <56 group; OR 1.80 CI 1.07-3.06, [&ge;]56 group), cough (OR 1.20, CI 1.05-1.38, <56 group; OR 1.37 CI 1.04-1.80, [&ge;]56 group) and headache only in <56 group (OR 1.71, CI 1.48-1.99). In turn, at the time of presentation, the symptoms associated with respiratory problems: chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, respiratory failure and use of accessory muscles for breathing, had a negative association with COVID-19 (OR <1) or did not present statistical relevance (OR = 1).

With the intention of helping the clinical diagnosis, we designed a model to be able to identify possible cases of COVID-19. This model included 16 symptoms, the age and sex of the individuals, and was able to detect 80% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 with a specificity of 46%.

ConclusionsThe analysis of symptoms opens the opportunity for a guidance and improved symptoms based definition of suspected cases of COVID-19, where multiple factors (age, sex, symptoms and interaction between symptoms) are considered. We present a tool to help identify COVID-19 cases to provide quick information to aid decision-making by health personnel and program managers.",Pedro Emanuel Fleitas; Jorge A Paz; Mario I Simoy; Carlos Vargas; Ruben O Cimino; Alejandro J Krolewiecki; Juan P Aparicio,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207019,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207019,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
186,Title: COVID-19 and frontline health workers in West Africa: a scoping review,"IntroductionThe novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global health threat since its emergence. Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa.

Materials and methodsLiterature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question.

ResultsOf the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility.

ConclusionBeing the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa, the study has illustrated the urgent need for West African governments to enact laws/rules that would compel all frontline health workers to adhere to all the COVID-19 protocols at the workplace. To end intermittent shortage or issue of inadequate PPEs, governments ought to liaise with local industries by empowering them, providing financial support and creating a conducive atmosphere for them to produce cost effective PPEs using available local resources.

187,On Modeling of COVID-19 for the Indian Subcontinent using Polynomial and Supervised Learning Regression,"COVID-19, a recently declared pandemic by WHO has taken the world by storm causing catastrophic damage to human life. The novel cornonavirus disease was first incepted in the Wuhan city of China on 31st December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Since the devastating phenomenon is essentially a time-series representation, accurate modeling may benefit in identifying the root cause and accelerate the diagnosis. In the current analysis, COVID-19 modeling is done for the Indian subcontinent based on the data collected for the total cases confirmed, daily recovered, daily deaths, total recovered and total deaths. The data is treated with total confirmed cases as the target variable and rest as feature variables. It is observed that Support vector regressions yields accurate results followed by Polynomial regression. Random forest regression results in overfitting followed by poor Bayesian regression due to highly correlated feature variables. Further, in order to examine the effect of neighbouring countries, Pearson correlation matrix is computed to identify geographic cause and effect.",Dishita Neve; Honey Patel; Harsh S Dhiman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212563,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212563,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
188,"CoViD-19, learning from the past: A wavelet and cross-correlation analysis of the epidemic dynamics looking to emergency calls and Twitter trends in Italian Lombardy region","The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Italy was detected on February the 20th in Lombardy region. Since that date, Lombardy has been the most affected Italian region by the epidemic, and its healthcare system underwent a severe crisis during the outbreak. From a public health point of view, therefore, it is fundamental to provide healthcare services with tools that can reveal a possible new epidemic burden with a certain time anticipation, which is the main aim of the present study. Moreover, the sequence of law decrees to face the epidemic and the large amount of news generated in the population feelings of anxiety and suspicion. Considering this whole complex context, it is easily understandable how people ""overcrowded"" social media with messages dealing with the pandemic, and emergency numbers were overwhelmed by the calls. Thus, in order to find potential predictors of a possible second epidemic wave, we analyzed data both from Twitter and from emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Since our principal goal is to forecast a possible new ascending phase of the epidemic, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast a new burden. Since we analyzed aggregated regional data, and taking into account also the huge geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic spread, a future perspective would be to conduct the same analysis on a more local basis.",Bruno Alessandro Rivieccio; Alessandra Micheletti; Manuel Maffeo; Matteo Zignani; Alessandro Comunian; Federica Nicolussi; Silvia Salini; Giancarlo Manzi; Francesco Auxilia; Mauro Giudici; Giovanni Naldi; Sabrina Gaito; Silvana Castaldi; Elia Biganzoli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212415,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212415,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
189,Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed.

MethodsAn ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions.

FindingsBetween April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms.

There was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p<0.05).

InterpretationIn a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.

190,A betacoronavirus multiplex microsphere immunoassay detects early SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and controls for pre-existing seasonal human coronavirus antibody cross-reactivity,"With growing concern of persistent or multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays remain critical for community and hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Here, we describe the development and application of a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA) for COVD-19 antibody studies, utilizing serum samples from non-human primate SARS-CoV-2 infection models, an archived human sera bank and subjects enrolled at five U.S. military hospitals. The MMIA incorporates prefusion stabilized spike glycoprotein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the seasonal human coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, into a multiplexing system that enables simultaneous measurement of off-target pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We report the sensitivity and specificity performances for this assay strategy at 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity for subject samples collected as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms. In archival sera collected prior to 2019 and serum samples from subjects PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2, we detected seroprevalence of 72% and 98% for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-0C43, respectively. Requiring only 1.25 {micro}L of sera, this approach permitted the simultaneous identification of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, further demonstrating the presence of conserved epitopes in the spike glycoprotein of zoonotic betacoronaviruses. Application of this serology assay in observational studies with serum samples collected from subjects before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection will permit an investigation of the influences of HCoV-induced antibodies on COVID-19 clinical outcomes.",Eric D.

191,The effect of influenza vaccination on trained immunity: impact on COVID-19,"Every year, influenza causes 290.000 to 650.000 deaths worldwide and vaccination is encouraged to prevent infection in high-risk individuals. Interestingly, cross-protective effects of vaccination against heterologous infections have been reported, and long-term boosting of innate immunity (also termed trained immunity) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Several epidemiological studies also suggested cross-protection between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 during the current pandemic. However, the mechanism behind such an effect is unknown. Using an established in-vitro model of trained immunity, we demonstrate that the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine used in the Netherlands in the 2019-2020 influenza season can induce a trained immunity response, including an improvement of cytokine responses after stimulation of human immune cells with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was less common among Dutch hospital employees who had received influenza vaccination during the 2019/2020 winter season (RR = 0,61 (95% CI, 0.4585 - 0.8195, P = 0.001). In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against COVID-19. These data, coupled with similar recent independent reports, argue for a beneficial effect of influenza vaccination against influenza as well as COVID-19, and suggests its effective deployment in the 2020-2021 influenza season to protect against both infections.",Priya A.

192,Early Prediction of COVID-19 Severity Using Extracellular Vesicles and Extracellular RNAs,"The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death. But the predictive biomarkers for characterizing the variability are still lacking. Since emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are functionally involved in a number of pathological processes, we hypothesize that these extracellular components may be key determinants and/or predictors of COVID-19 severity. To test our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms at the time of their admission. After standard therapy without corticosteroids, 9 of the 31 patients developed severe COVID-19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID-19 severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and liver damage-related exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. Among these markers, EV COPB2 has the best predictive value for severe deterioration of COVID-19 patients in this cohort. This type of information concerning functional extracellular component profiles could have great value for patient stratification and for making early clinical decisions about strategies for COVID-19 therapy.",Yu Fujita; Tokio Hoshina; Juntaro Matsuzaki; Tsukasa Kadota; Shota Fujimoto; Hironori Kawamoto; Naoaki Watanabe; Kenji Sawaki; Yohei Sakamoto; Makiko Miyajima; Kwangyole Lee; Kazuhiko Nakaharai; Tetsuya Horino; Ryo Nakagawa; Jun Araya; Mitsuru Miyato; Masaki Yoshida; Kazuyoshi Kuwano; Takahiro Ochiya,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212340,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212340,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
193,How to remove the testing bias in CoV-2 statistics,"BACKGROUNDPublic health measures and private behaviour are based on reported numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Some argue that testing influences the confirmed number of infections.

OBJECTIVES/METHODSDo time series on reported infections and the number of tests allow one to draw conclusions about actual infection numbers? A SIR model is presented where the true numbers of susceptible, infectious and removed individuals are unobserved. Testing is also modelled.

RESULTSOfficial confirmed infection numbers are likely to be biased and cannot be compared over time. The bias occurs because of different reasons for testing (e.g. by symptoms, representative or testing travellers). The paper illustrates the bias and works out the effect of the number of tests on the number of reported cases. The paper also shows that the positive rate (the ratio of positive tests to the total number of tests) is uninformative in the presence of non-representative testing.

CONCLUSIONSA severity index for epidemics is proposed that is comparable over time. This index is based on Covid-19 cases and can be obtained if the reason for testing is known.",Klaus Waelde,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212431,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212431,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
194,Drug synergy of combinatory treatment with remdesivir and the repurposed drugs fluoxetine and itraconazole effectively impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.",Ursula Rescher; Sebastian Schloer; Linda Brunotte; Angeles Mecate-Zambrano; Shuyu Zheng; Jing Tang; Stephan Ludwig,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
195,Peptide vaccine candidate mimics the heterogeneity of natural SARS-CoV-2 immunity in convalescent humans and induces broad T cell responses in mice models,"We developed a global peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that addresses the dual challenges of heterogeneity in the immune responses of different individuals and potential heterogeneity of the infecting virus. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 is a polypeptide vaccine containing nine 30-mer peptides derived from all four major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents blood investigated, 1-5 months after symptom onset. The PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific T cell repertoire used for recovery from COVID-19 was extremely diverse: donors had an average of seven different peptide-specific T cells, against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins; 87% of donors had multiple targets against at least three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 53% against all four. In addition, PEPIs determined based on the complete HLA class I genotype of the convalescent donors were validated, with 84% accuracy, to predict PEPI-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured for the individuals. Extrapolation of the above findings to a US bone marrow donor cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities (n=1,000 each ethnic group) suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination in a general population will likely elicit broad, multi-antigenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity, including Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) cohorts.",Eszter Somogyi; Zsolt Csiszovszki; Levente Molnár; Orsolya Lőrincz; József Tóth; Sofie Pattijn; Jana Schockaert; Aurélie Mazy; István Miklós; Katalin Pántya; Péter Páles; Enikő R.

196,Abnormal Antibodies to Self-Carbohydrates in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients,"SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly virus that is causing the global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our immune system plays a critical role in preventing, clearing, and treating the virus, but aberrant immune responses can contribute to deleterious symptoms and mortality. Many aspects of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated, but little is known about immune responses to carbohydrates. Since the surface of the virus is heavily glycosylated, pre-existing antibodies to glycans could potentially recognize the virus and influence disease progression. Furthermore, antibody responses to carbohydrates could be induced, affecting disease severity and clinical outcome. In this study, we used a carbohydrate antigen microarray with over 800 individual components to profile serum anti-glycan antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy control subjects. In COVID-19 patients, we observed abnormally high IgG and IgM antibodies to numerous self-glycans, including gangliosides, N-linked glycans, LacNAc-containing glycans, blood group H, and sialyl Lewis X. Some of these anti-glycan antibodies are known to play roles in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, which may help explain some of the unusual and prolonged symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies to self-glycans has important implications for using convalescent serum to treat patients, developing safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and understanding the risks of infection. In addition, this study provides new insight into the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates the importance of including host and viral carbohydrate antigens when studying immune responses to viruses.",Dorothy L.

197,Antibody Response to a Nucleocapsid Epitope as a Marker for COVID-19 Disease Severity,"Characterization of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to predict COVID-19 disease trajectories. Ineffective antibodies or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) could derail patients immune responses, for example. ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis epitope-mapped plasma from 86 COVID-19 patients. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including ICU stay, requirement for ventilators, and death. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate both with various comorbidities and ADE hallmarks, including increased IL-6 levels and early IgG response. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within five days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day. The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 diagnostic for the early prediction of disease severity to guide more effective therapeutic interventions.

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the respiratory tract in parallel with antibodies and circulating T cells specific for various structural (NP, M, ORF3a and spike) and non-structural proteins (ORF7/8, NSP7 and NSP13). We observed that while rapid induction and quantity of humoral responses were associated with increased disease severity, an early induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells was present in patients with mild disease and accelerated viral clearance.

200,Duple extinguishment of COVID-19: single compound synergized inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and direct suppression of inflammatory cytokines in vitro/vivo,"The virus replication and lung inflammation are basic targets for COVID-19 treatment. To effectively treat COVID-19, the best chemical drug should combine inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and direct suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression together. Our SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) crystal structure studies revealed Au(I), derived from auranofin (AF) or gold cluster (GA), could specifically bind thiolate of Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. GA or AF could well inhibit Mpro activity and significantly decrease SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell. Cell studies showed that either AF or GA could down-regulate NF{kappa}B pathway, therefore significantly inhibit inflammatory cytokine level of IL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNF- in macrophage and bronchial epithelial cell, respectively. The lung viral load in GA treated COVID-19 mice (15mg/kg.bw) is significantly lower than that in normal saline (NS, 0.9% NaCl) treated COVID-19 mice, and pathological studies revealed GA treatment (score ~1.8) significantly reduced lung inflammatory injury compared with NS treated COVID-19 mice (score ~3). After normal mice were treated by GA (15mg/kg), the Au ingredient well distributed into lungs and there are no pathological changes in main organs when compared with control mice. The toxicity results revealed GA is more safety than auranofin for cell/mice/rat. The rat pharmacokinetics studies show GA is with high bioavailability (> 90%) in vivo.

201,Multivalency transforms SARS-CoV-2 antibodies into broad and ultrapotent neutralizers,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic. Antibodies are powerful biotherapeutics to fight viral infections; however, discovery of the most potent and broadly acting clones can be lengthy. Here, we used the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit to drive oligomerization of antibody fragments and transform antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into exceptionally potent neutralizers. Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 9 x 10-14 M were achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency enhancements. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral sequence variability together with outstanding potency and Ig-like in vivo bioavailability. This MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody; or MB) platform contributes a new class of medical countermeasures against COVID-19 and an efficient approach to rapidly deploy potent and broadly-acting therapeutics against infectious diseases of global health importance.

202,"The Theory and Practice of the viral dose in neutralization assay: insights on SARS-CoV-2 ""doublethink"" effect.","Due to the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for reliable high-throughput serological assays in order to evaluate the immunological responses against SARS-COV-2 virus and to enable population screening, as well as vaccines and drugs efficacy testing. Several serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are now becoming available in the market. However, it has also become extremely important to have well-established assays with desirable high sensitivity and specificity. To date, the micro-neutralization (MN) assay, is currently considered the gold-standard being capable of evaluating and detecting, functional neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Several protocols exist for microneutralization assays which vary in several steps of the protocol: cell seeding conditions, number of cells seeded, virus amount used in the infection step, virus-serum-cells incubation period etc. These potential differences account for a high degree of variability and inconsistency of the results and using a harmonized protocol for the micro-neutralization assay could potentially solve this.

Given this situation, the main aim of our study was to carry out SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus MN assay in order to investigate which optimal tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) infective dose in use is the most adequate choice for implementation in terms of reproducibility, standardization possibilities and comparability of results. Therefore, we assessed the MN by using two different viral infective doses: a standard dose of 100 TCID50/well and a lower dose of 25 TCID50/well. The results obtained, yielded by MN on using the lower infective dose (25 TCID50), were in line with those obtained with the standard infective dose; in some cases, however, we detected a titre that was one or two dilution steps higher, which maintained all negative samples negative. This suggesting that the lower dose can potentially have a positive impact on the detection and estimation of neutralizing antibodies present in a given sample, showing higher sensitivity but similar specificity and therefore, it would require a more accurate assessment and cross-laboratories standardisation especially when MN is employed as serological assay of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies.",Eleonora Molesti; Alessandro Manenti; Marta Maggetti; Giulia Lapini; Alessandro Torelli; Emanuele Montomoli,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342428,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342428,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
203,The effect of temperature and humidity on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses,"Since emerging in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, and it may become an endemic human pathogen. Understanding the impact of environmental conditions on SARS-CoV-2 viability and its transmission potential is crucial to anticipating epidemic dynamics and designing mitigation strategies. Ambient temperature and humidity are known to have strong effects on the environmental stability of viruses1, but there is little data for SARS-CoV-2, and a general quantitative understanding of how temperature and humidity affect virus stability has remained elusive. Here, we characterise the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at a variety of temperature and humidity conditions, and introduce a mechanistic model that enables accurate prediction of virus stability in unobserved conditions. We find that SARS-CoV-2 survives better at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life was more than 24 hours at 10 {degrees}C and 40 % RH, but approximately an hour and a half at 27 {degrees}C and 65 % RH. Our results highlight scenarios of particular transmission risk, and provide a mechanistic explanation for observed superspreading events in cool indoor environments such as food processing plants. Moreover, our model predicts observations from other human coronaviruses and other studies of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the existence of shared mechanisms that determine environmental stability across a number of enveloped viruses.",Dylan H.

204,Targeting androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 as a therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an adverse effect on the progression of multiple cancers, including prostate cancer, due to the ensuing cytokine storm and associated oncogenic signaling. Epidemiological data showing increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in men suggests a potential role for androgen in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse tissues and human prostate and lung cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. In an overexpression model, and the prostate and lung cells, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens such as enzalutamide/AR-PROTAC, or Camostat treatment attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry in lung and prostate cells. Together, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy and androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with anti-viral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent inflammation driven COVID-19 progression.",Qu Deng; Reyaz ur Rasool; Ronnie M Russell; Ramakrishnan Natesan; Irfan A Asangani,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342782,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342782,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
205,"Social contact patterns among employees in 3 U.S. companies during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, April to June 2020.","2.ImportanceDevising control strategies against diseases such as COVID-19 require understanding of contextual social mixing and contact patterns. There has been no standardized multi-site social contact study conducted in workplace settings in the United States that can be used to broadly inform pandemic preparedness policy in these settings.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to characterize the patterns of social contacts and mixing across workplace environments, including on-site or when teleworking.

DesignThis was a cross-sectional non-probability survey that used standardized social contact diaries to collect data. Employees were requested to record their physical and non-physical contacts in a diary over two consecutive days, documented at the end of each day. Employees from each company were enrolled through email and electronic diaries sent as individual links. Data were collected from April to June 2020.

SettingTwo multinational consulting companies and one university administrative department, all located in Georgia, USA.

ParticipantsEmployees opted into the study by accepting the invitation on a link sent via email.

Main OutcomeThe outcome was median number of contacts per person per day. This was stratified by day of data collection, age, sex, race and ethnicity.

ResultsOf 3,835 employees approached, 357 (9.3%) completed the first day of contact diary of which 304 completed both days of contact diary. There was a median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-21) per respondent on both day one and two. The majority (55%) of contacts involved conversation only, occurred at home (64%), and cumulatively lasted more than 4 hours (38%). Most contacts were repeated, and within same age groups, though participants aged 30-59 years reported substantial inter-generational mixing with children.

ConclusionParticipating employees in 3 surveyed workplaces reported few contacts, similar to studies from the UK and China when shelter-in-place orders were in effect during the pandemic. Many contacts were repeated which may limit the spread of infection. Future rounds are planned to assess changes in contact patterns when employees resume work in the office after the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic.",Moses Chapa Kiti; Obianuju G Aguolu; Carol Liu; Ana Mesa Restrepo; Rachel Regina; Kathryn Willebrand; Chandra Couzens; Tilman Bartelsmeyer; Kristin Nicole Bratton; Samuel M Jenness; Steven Riley; Alessia Melegaro; Faruque Ahmed; Fauzia Malik; Ben Lopman; Saad B Omer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212423,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212423,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,True
206,IgM autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 are associated with severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe disease in a subpopulation of patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate robust IgM autoantibodies that recognize angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in 18/66 (27%) patients with severe COVID-19, which are rare (2/52; 3.8%) in hospitalized patients who are not ventilated. The antibodies do not undergo class-switching to IgG, suggesting a T-independent antibody response. Purified IgM from anti-ACE2 patients activates complement. Pathological analysis of lung obtained at autopsy shows endothelial cell staining for IgM in blood vessels in some patients. We propose that vascular endothelial ACE2 expression focuses the pathogenic effects of these autoantibodies on blood vessels, and contributes to the angiocentric pathology observed in some severe COVID-19 patients. These findings may have predictive and therapeutic implications.

A recent mathematical model has suggested that staying at home did not play a dominant role in reducing COVID-19 transmission. Comparison between number of deaths and social mobility is difficult due to the non-stationary nature of the COVID-19 data.

ObjectiveTo propose a novel approach to assess the association between staying at home values and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions around the world.

211,Sociodemographic correlates of access to sanitary pads among college students in Lucknow during COVID 19 lockdown,"IntroductionSanitary napkin is an essential aspect of the Menstrual management materials for women and adolescent girls between menarche and menopause. Despite being an important issue concerning women and girls in the menstruating age group, access to menstrual hygiene products neglected during the COVID19 pandemic. Further, there is no evidence of the practice of menstrual hygiene products in Indian settings during this period. This paper investigates the prevalence of socio-demographic correlations of access to sanitary napkins among college students in Lucknow.

MethodsAn online retrospective cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lucknow in September 2020. In total, 1439 participants took part in the survey. After removing 55 participants, those quit the survey by clicking on the disagree button and 13 were not satisfying inclusion criteria. So the final samples were 1371, which were included in the analysis. Students of UG and PG currently studying in colleges in the Lucknow were eligible to participate. The data collection was anonymous. Responses were analysed using descriptive and bivariate logistic regression.

ResultsIn this study, 1371 students were included, making a response rate of 96.2 percent. Nearly 12.5 percent of students reported about difficulty encountered during the lockdown. Muslims, Father education illiterate or upto12th, father occupation as farmer, monthly salary less than 25 thousand, residence as rural, and history of reusable clothes were more likely to face problems to access sanitary pads during the lockdown in Lucknow (P < .05).

ConclusionsDuring COVID-19 lockdown, about 12.5 % of girls were dependent on either locally available resources as absorbents during menstruation or paid more to access in Lucknow. Because of the lockdown, many people have lost their livelihood. More than ever, economically low-income families are reluctant to spend on sanitary pads, which is why few college girls were going back to their previous handling periods by using rags.

212,"Characteristics and Factors Associated with COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Mortality Across Race and Ethnicity","BackgroundData on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited. We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across the major racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study analyzed patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large, integrated health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and August 30, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death were assessed with multivariate logistic regression.

Findings289,294 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, of whom 27.5% were non-White minorities. 15,605 persons tested positive, with minorities representing 58.0%. Disparities were widest among Hispanics, who represented 40.5% of infections but 12.8% of those tested. Hispanics were generally younger and had fewer comorbidities except diabetes than White patients. Of the 3,197 patients hospitalized, 58.9% were non-White. 459 patients died, of whom 49.8% were minorities. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increase odds of testing positive and hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities except American Indian/Alaska Native. Highest odds of testing SARS-CoV-2 positive was for Hispanic patients (OR [95% CI]: 3.68 [3.52-3.84]) and highest odds of COVID-19 hospitalization was for Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients (2.13 [1.48 - 3.06]). Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity including need for mechanical ventilation. In multivariate modeling, Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with increased odds of hospital mortality (1.75 [1.15-2.67]) among patients over age 70, but hospital mortality was not increased for any race/ethnicity sub-population in the multivariate model.

InterpretationMajor healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a higher rate, and despite younger in age, required excess hospitalization and need for mechanical ventilation compared to their expected demographic proportions. As characteristics of patients varying between race/ethnicity, targeted, culturally-responsive interventions are needed to address the increased risk of poor outcomes among minority populations with COVID-19.

It is unknown whether the advantages of LUS implementation could be paired with deep learning techniques to match or exceed human-level, diagnostic specificity among similar appearing, pathological LUS images.

DesignA convolutional neural network was trained on LUS images with B lines of different etiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set was compared to surveyed LUS-competent physicians.

SettingTwo tertiary Canadian hospitals.

Participants600 LUS videos (121,381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either 1) COVID-19, Non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) and 3) Hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE).

ResultsThe trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (AUC 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies. This was significantly better than physician ability (AUCs of 0.697, 0.704, 0.967 for the COVID, NCOVID and HPE classes, respectively), p < 0.01.

214,Physical Activity Decreases the Prevalence of COVID-19-associated Hospitalization: Brazil EXTRA Study,"ObjectivesWe compared physical activity levels before the outbreak and quarantine measures with COVID-19-associated hospitalization prevalence in surviving patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we investigated the association of physical activity levels with symptoms of the disease, length of hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation.

MethodsBetween June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We shared the electronic link to the questionnaire on the internet. In this cross-sectional study, we collected data about clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay) and cofactors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases, socioeconomic and educational, and physical activity levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short version).

ResultsOut of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate analysis, sex, age, and BMI were all associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Men had a higher prevalence of hospitalization (66.6%, P=0.013). Patients older than 65 years, obese, and with preexisting disease had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. In a multivariate regression model, performance of at least 150 min/wk (moderate) and/or 75 min/wk (vigorous) physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of hospitalizations after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and preexisting diseases (PR=0.657; P=0.046).

ConclusionsSufficient physical activity levels are associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity physical activity reduces this prevalence by 34.3%.

215,Heterogeneity in transmissibility and shedding SARS-CoV-2 via droplets and aerosols,"A growing number of studies provide insight into how SARS-CoV-2 spreads1-7. Yet, many factors that characterize its transmissibility remain unclear, including mechanistic correlates of overdispersion, viral kinetics, the extent to which respiratory droplets and aerosols carry viable virus and the infectiousness of asymptomatic, presymptomatic and pediatric cases7. Here, we developed a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) via systematic review and investigated these factors using meta-analyses and modeling. By comparing cases of COVID-19, SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, we found that heterogeneity in rVL was associated with overdispersion and facilitated the distinctions in individual variation in infectiousness among these emergent diseases. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity was broad throughout the infectious period, although rVL tended to peak at 1 day from symptom onset (DFSO) and be elevated for 1-5 DFSO. While most cases presented minimal risk, highly infectious ones could spread SARS-CoV-2 by talking, singing or breathing, which shed virions at comparable rates via droplets and aerosols. Coughing shed considerable quantities of virions, predominantly via droplets, and greatly increased the contagiousness of many symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Asymptomatic and symptomatic infections showed similar likelihoods of expelling aerosols with SARS-CoV-2, as did adult and pediatric cases. Children tended to be less contagious by droplet spread than adults based on tendencies of symptomatology rather than rVL.

The intent-to-treat primary analyses are of in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs its controls (concurrently allocated the same management without that drug, despite availability). Kaplan-Meier 28-day risks are unstratified; log-rank death rate ratios (RRs) are stratified for age and ventilation at entry.

RESULTSIn 405 hospitals in 30 countries 11,266 adults were randomized, with 2750 allocated Remdesivir, 954 Hydroxychloroquine, 1411 Lopinavir, 651 Interferon plus Lopinavir, 1412 only Interferon, and 4088 no study drug. Compliance was 94-96% midway through treatment, with 2-6% crossover. 1253 deaths were reported (at median day 8, IQR 4-14). Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 12% (39% if already ventilated at randomization, 10% otherwise). Death rate ratios (with 95% CIs and numbers dead/randomized, each drug vs its control) were: Remdesivir RR=0.95 (0.81-1.11, p=0.50; 301/2743 active vs 303/2708 control), Hydroxychloroquine RR=1.19 (0.89-1.59, p=0.23; 104/947 vs 84/906), Lopinavir RR=1.00 (0.79-1.25, p=0.97; 148/1399 vs 146/1372) and Interferon RR=1.16 (0.96-1.39, p=0.11; 243/2050 vs 216/2050). No study drug definitely reduced mortality (in unventilated patients or any other subgroup of entry characteristics), initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration.

CONCLUSIONSThese Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The mortality findings contain most of the randomized evidence on Remdesivir and Interferon, and are consistent with meta-analyses of mortality in all major trials. (Funding: WHO.

217,A high throughput RNA displacement assay for screening SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex towards developing therapeutics for COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, evades the human immune system by capping its RNA. This process protects the viral RNA and is essential for its replication. Multiple viral proteins are involved in this RNA capping process including the nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) which is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2-O-methyltransferase. Nsp16 is significantly active when in complex with another nonstructural protein, nsp10, which plays a key role in its stability and activity. Here we report the development of a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based RNA displacement assay for nsp10-nsp16 complex in 384-well format with a Z'-Factor of 0.6, suitable for high throughput screening. In this process, we purified the nsp10-nsp16 complex to higher than 95% purity and confirmed its binding to the methyl donor SAM, product of the reaction, SAH, and a common methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). The assay was further validated by screening a library of 1124 drug-like compounds. This assay provides a cost-effective high throughput method for screening nsp10-nsp16 complex for RNA-competitive inhibitors towards developing COVID-19 therapeutics.",Sumera Perveen; Aliakbar Khalili Yazdi; Kanchan Devkota; Fengling Li; Pegah Ghiabi; Taraneh Hajian; Peter Loppnau; Albina Bolotokova; Masoud Vedadi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.340034,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.340034,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,False
218,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in vitro upon blocking N- and O-glycan elaboration,"The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its receptor binding domain (RBD), and its primary receptor ACE2 are extensively glycosylated. The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.",Qi Yang; Thomas A. Hughes; Anju Kelkar; Xinheng Yu; Kai Cheng; Sheldon J. Park; We-Chiao Huang; Jonathan F.

219,Multiplexed proteomics and imaging of resolving and lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung,"Normal tissue physiology and repair depends on communication with the immune system. Understanding this communication at the molecular level in intact tissue requires new methods. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in acute respiratory distress, thrombosis and death, has been studied primarily in accessible liquid specimens such as blood, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage, all of which are peripheral to the primary site of infection in the lung. Here, we describe the combined use of multiplexed deep proteomics with multiplexed imaging to profile infection and its sequelae directly in fixed lung tissue specimens obtained from necropsy of infected animals and autopsy of human decedents. We characterize multiple steps in disease response from cytokine accumulation and protein phosphorylation to activation of receptors, changes in signaling pathways, and crosslinking of fibrin to form clots. Our data reveal significant differences between naturally resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques and lethal COVID-19 in humans. The approach we describe is broadly applicable to other tissues and diseases.

220,The Strand-biased Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 and Unbalanced Inhibition by Remdesivir,"SARS-CoV-2, a positive single-stranded RNA virus, caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Although its sense-mRNA architecture was reported, its anti-sense strand was unexplored. Here, we deeply sequenced both strands of RNA and found SARS-CoV-2 transcription is strongly biased to form the sense strand. During negative strand synthesis, apart from canonical sub-genomic ORFs, numerous non-canonical fusion transcripts are formed, driven by 3-15 nt sequence homology scattered along the genome but more prone to be inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase inhibitor Remdesivir. The drug also represses more of the negative than the positive strand synthesis as supported by a mathematic simulation model and experimental quantifications. Overall, this study opens new sights into SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis and may facilitate the anti-viral drug design.

221,Evidence of antigenic imprinting in sequential Sarbecovirus immunization,"Antigenic imprinting, which describes the bias of antibody response due to previous immune history, can influence vaccine effectiveness and has been reported in different viruses. Give that COVID-19 vaccine development is currently a major focus of the world, there is a lack of understanding of how background immunity influence antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. This study provides evidence for antigenic imprinting in Sarbecovirus, which is the subgenus that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to. Specifically, we sequentially immunized mice with two antigenically distinct Sarbecovirus strains, namely SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We found that the neutralizing antibodies triggered by the sequentially immunization are dominantly against the one that is used for priming. Given that the impact of the background immunity on COVID-19 is still unclear, our results will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of this disease as well as COVID-19 vaccination strategy.",Huibin Lv; Ray T.Y.

222,Systematic analysis of innate immune antagonism reveals vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2,"The innate immune system efficiently defends the human host against viral pathogens. Thus, viruses evolved strategies to counteract immune activation. Here, we systematically analysed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins on three major arms of our cell-intrinsic innate immune defences: interferon (IFN) induction, cytokine signalling and autophagy. Subsequent mechanistic analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins target the respective signalling cascades at multiple steps. For example, we show that Nsp14 reduces endogenous IFN receptor levels and ORF3a and ORF7a perturb the late endosomal/trans-Golgi network. Our data demonstrates that most antagonistic activities are conserved between proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the closely related bat RaTG13-CoV and the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1. However, SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is strikingly more potent in suppressing IFN induction and signalling than its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. This may help explain the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitated its rapid spread. Overall our analyses revealed that IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{lambda}1 signalling are antagonised the least, leaving SARS-CoV-2 highly susceptible to these two cytokines. Their combination synergistically potentiated the anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Taken together, our results allow an explanation for differences in susceptibility towards IFNs and provide evidence that rational immune activation may be an effective future therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",Manuel Hayn; Maximilian Hirschenberger; Lennart Koepke; Jan Hendrik Straub; Rayhane Nchioua; Susanne Klute; Caterina Prelli Bozzo; Wasim Aftab; Fabian Zech; Carina Conzelmann; Janis Alexander Mueller; Smitha Srinivasachar Badarinarayan; Christina Martina Stuerzel; Ignasi Forne; Steffen Stenger; Karl-Klaus Conzelmann; Jan Muench; Daniel Sauter; Axel Imhof; Frank Kirchhoff; Konstantin Maria Johannes Sparrer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.340612,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.340612,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,False

Rapid and comprehensive analysis of both pathogen and host sequencing data is critical to track infection and inform therapies. In this study, we performed unbiased metatranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples from COVID-19 patients using a newly-developed RNA-seq library construction method (TRACE-seq), which utilizes tagmentation activity of Tn5 on RNA/DNA hybrids. This approach avoids the laborious and time-consuming steps in traditional RNA-seq procedure, and hence is fast, sensitive and convenient. We demonstrated that TRACE-seq allowed integrated characterization of full genome information of SARS-CoV-2, putative pathogens causing coinfection, antibiotic resistance and host response from single throat swabs.

224,Quantitative Assays Reveal Cell Fusion at Minimal Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Fusion-from-Without,"Cell entry of the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by its spike protein S. As main antigenic determinant, S protein is in focus of antibody-based prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Besides particle-cell fusion, S mediates fusion between infected and uninfected cells resulting in syncytia formation. Here we present quantitative assay systems covering not only particle-cell and cell-cell fusion, but also demonstrating fusion-from-without (FFWO), the formation of syncytia induced by S-containing viral particles in absence of newly synthesized S protein. Based on complementation of split {beta}-galactosidase and virus-like-particles (VLPs) displaying S protein, this assay can be performed at BSL-1. All three assays provided readouts with a high dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratios covering several orders of magnitude. The data obtained confirm the enhancing effect of trypsin and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on membrane fusion. Neutralizing antibodies as well as sera from convalescent patients inhibited particle-cell fusion with high efficiency. Cell-cell fusion, in contrast, was only moderately inhibited despite requiring much lower levels of S protein, which were below the detection limit of flow cytometry and Western blot. The data indicate that syncytia formation as a pathological consequence in tissues of Covid-19 patients can proceed at low levels of S protein and may not be effectively prevented by antibodies.",Samuel A.

225,A Common Methodological Phylogenomics Framework for intra-patient heteroplasmies to infer SARS-CoV-2 sublineages and tumor clones,"We present a common methodological framework to infer the phylogenomics from genomic data, be it reads of SARS-CoV-2 of multiple COVID-19 patients or bulk DNAseq of the tumor of a cancer patient. The commonality is in the phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads in both scenarios. While there is evidence of heteroplasmy, i.e., multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the same COVID-19 patient; to date, there is no evidence of sublineages recombining within the same patient. The heterogeneity in a patients tumor is analogous to intra-patient heteroplasmy and the absence of recombination in the cells of tumor is a widely accepted assumption. Just as the different frequencies of the genomic variants in a tumor presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that so do the different variant frequencies in the viral reads, offering the means to infer the multiple co-infecting sublineages. We describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We also make some additional discoveries. We uncovered new potential parallel mutation in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

In this study, we present the design of a lipid nanoparticles (LNP)-encapsulated receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA vaccine. Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulation have been chosen for the subsequent RBD mRNA vaccine experiment.

227,"Predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Athens, Greece","BackgroundThe epidemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths. Numerous efforts are being made to clarify how the infection progresses and potential factors associated with disease severity and mortality. We investigated the mortality in Greek hospitalized COVID-19 patients and also the predictors of this mortality.

MethodsStudy population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis.

ResultsThe mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age [&ge;]65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.

228,Should international borders re-open? The impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 importation risk,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread across the world at an unprecedented pace, reaching over 200 countries and territories in less than three months. In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open.

DesignThis was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which employed an interviewer-administered four-page questionnaire built into the Open Data Kit application for android phones. Knowledge and practice scores were computed by scoring every correct response/action as 1 and wrong responses as 0. Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of [&ge;]80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were categorized as having correct handwashing practice.

SettingRivers State in the South-South region of Nigeria had recorded over 2000 cases of COVID 19 as of 18th August 2020, ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria. As with any epidemic of an infectious nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. Risk communication utilizes multi-faceted activities geared towards facilitating correct and consistent knowledge and prevention practice.

ParticipantsStudy involved 1,294 adult community residents in the 23 districts of the state.

ResultsThe respondents were aged between 18 and 80 years with average age of 39.6 years (SD = 11.9 years). A total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary education. Almost all respondents 1,271 (98.2%) had heard about COVID 19. The three most common sources of information about COVID 19 were radio jingles 1102 (86.7%), television adverts 940 (74.0%) and announcements in Church 612 (48.2%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had poor knowledge of COVID 19.

230,Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based population: Results from an epidemiological study,"Background: Prior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods. Methods: We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection. Conclusions: Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health.

MethodsWe examined the impact of COVID-19 on household and child food security in three preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx urban cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area (N=375 households, 1,875 individuals). Households were initially recruited during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this COVID sub-study, participants responded to a 15-minute telephonic interview. Participants answered 18 questions from the US Food Security Food Module (US HFSSM), described food consumption, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection as per community or hospital-based testing. Food security and insecurity levels were compared with prior year metrics.

ResultsWe found low levels of household food security in Latinx families (by cohort: 29.2%; 34.2%; 60.0%) and child food security (56.9%; 54.1%; 78.0%) with differences between cohorts explained by self-reported levels of education and employment status. Food security levels were much lower than those reported previously in two cohorts where data had been recorded from prior years. Reported history of COVID-19 infection in households was 4.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI); 1.5-14.3%); 7.2% (95%CI; 3.6-13.9%) and 3.5% (95%CI; 1.7-7.2%) by cohort and was associated with food insecurity in the two larger cohorts (p=0.03; p=0.01 respectively).

ConclusionsLatinx families in the Bay Area with children are experiencing a sharp rise in food insecurity levels during the COVID-19 epidemic. Food insecurity, similar to other indices of poverty, is associated with increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive interventions are needed to address food insecurity in Latinx populations and further studies are needed to better assess independent associations between household food insecurity, poor nutritional health and risk of COVID-19 infection.",Milagro Escobar; Andrea DeCastro Mendez; Maria Romer Encinas; Janet Wojcicki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210906,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210906,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
233,Network Graph Representation of COVID-19 Scientific Publications to Aid Knowledge Discovery,"IntroductionNumerous scientific journal articles have been rapidly published related to COVID-19 making navigation and understanding of relationships difficult.

MethodsA graph network was constructed from the publicly available CORD-19 database of COVID-19-related publications using an engine leveraging medical knowledgebases to identify discrete medical concepts and an open source tool (Gephi) used to visualise the network.

ResultsThe network shows connections between disease, medication and procedures identified from title and abstracts of 195,958 COVID-19 related publications (CORD-19 Dataset). Connections between terms with few publications, those unconnected to the main network and those irrelevant were not displayed. Nodes were coloured by knowledgebase and node size related to the number of publications containing the term. The dataset and visualisations made publicly accessible via a webtool.

ConclusionKnowledge management approaches (text mining and graph networks) can effectively allow rapid navigation and exploration of entity interrelationships to improve understanding of diseases such as COVID-19.",George Cernile; Trevor Heritage; Neil Sebire; Ben Gordon; Taralyn Schwering; Shana Kazemlou; Yulia Borecki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211342,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211342,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
234,COVID-CT-Mask-Net: Prediction of COVID-19 from CT Scans Using Regional Features,"We present COVID-CT-Mask-Net model that predicts COVID-19 from CT scans. The model works in two stages: first, it detects the instances of ground glass opacity and consolidation in CT scans, then predicts the condition from the ranked bounding box detections. To develop the solution for the three-class problem (COVID, common pneumonia and control), we used the COVIDx-CT dataset derived from the dataset of CT scans collected by China National Center for Bioinformation. We use about 5% of the training split of COVIDx-CT to train the model, and without any complicated data normalization, balancing and regularization, and training only a small fraction of the models parameters, we achieve a 90.80% COVID sensitivity, 91.62% common pneumonia sensitivity and 92.10% normal sensitivity, and an overall accuracy of 91.66% on the test data (21182 images), bringing the ratio of test/train data to 7.06, which implies a very high capacity of the model to generalize to new data. We also establish an important result, that ranked regional predictions (bounding boxes with scores) in Mask R-CNN can be used to make accurate predictions of the image class.

236,CORRELATION BETWEEN SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODY SCREENING BY IMMUNOASSAY AND NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TESTING,"BackgroundPassive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP) represents a promising alternative for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The efficacy of CP therapy has been associated with high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the plasma of recovered patients, but the assays for quantifying nAbs are not widely available. Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of the CP potential donors.

MethodsTwo hundred and fourteen CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two commercial immunoassays (IA): Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG EUROIMMUN and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott. In parallel, quantification of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) was performed using the Cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-VNT). Three criteria for identifying donors with high titers of nAbs ([&ge;]1:160) were tested: - Criterion1: Curve ROC Method; - Criterion 2: Conditional decision tree considering only the results from the IA and -Criterion 3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables.

ResultsThe performance of Abbott and EUROIMMUN immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers [&ge;] 1:160. Regarding the three studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers ([&ge;] 1:160): 1) Criterion 1 showed 76.1% accuracy when the S/CO cut-off of 4.65 was used, 2) Criterion 2 presented 76.1% accuracy if the S/CO [&ge;] 4.57 was applied and 3) Criterion 3 had 71.6% accuracy if either S/CO [&ge;] 4.57 or S/CO between 2.68 and 4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms occurred less than 19 days from donor recruiting were used.

ConclusionThe results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (S/CO) can be used to predict high nAbs titers of potential CP donors. This study has proposed three different criteria for identifying donors with [&ge;] 1:160 nAbs titer based on either solely S/CO results or S/CO together with clinical variables, all with high efficacy and accuracy.",ALFREDO MENDRONE-JUNIOR; CARLA DINARDO; SUZETE FERREIRA; ANNA NISHIA; NANCI SALLES; CESAR ALMEIDA-NETO; DEBORA HAMASAKI; TILA FACINCANI; LUCAS ALVES; RAFAEL MACHADO; DANIELLE ARAUJO; EDISON DURIGON; VANDERSON ROCHA; ESTER SABINO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210005,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210005,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
237,"School education during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - Which concept is safe, feasible and environmentally sound?","OverviewThe future belongs to children and they need education to shape the future with foresight and intention. Children therefore have the right to education, according to Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child [1]. However, professional education is not everything, because children must also experience their strengths and weaknesses together and educate each other to be responsible and considerate people, so that they become socially valuable personalities. Only in this way can they shape the future in a peaceful and humane way. Therefore, attending school is essential. However, children also have the right to protection and care by their parents and the state, because the welfare of the child must also be given priority in accordance with Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The question is therefore how schooling in community schools can be realized during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without exposing children to an unnecessary risk of infection. It is not only about the children, because if the children are at risk, then so are their parents and grandparents and ultimately society as a whole. There are numerous concepts that promise safety in schools during the pandemic. When selecting concepts, the costs must of course be weighed against the benefits. People rightly expect an efficient use of resources. This means that either the set goal is achieved with the least possible resources or that the available resources are used to achieve the greatest possible approximation to the goal. In addition to the financial resources, however, the long-term consequences for the state, the economy, the population and the environment under the pressure of the pandemic must also be taken into account. Social cohesion and democracy must not be jeopardized either. Various protection concepts are currently under discussion. Often the advantages are overstated and the disadvantages concealed. Furthermore, some arguments are based on assumptions that are not true. The aim of this study is to provide a comparative assessment of the main protection concepts and to demonstrate, with the help of experimental analyses, the extent to which the protection concepts are effective. We will show that a comparatively high level of safety against infection in classrooms can be technically ensured without exposing children to masks. At the same time, the protection concept makes economic sense and the burden on the environment is comparatively low, so that infection prevention and climate protection do not have to be weighed against each other, because infection prevention and climate protection are political and social goals that have to be achieved together.",Christian J.

238,High and increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity in England during end September beginning October 2020: REACT-1 round 5 updated report,"BackgroundREACT-1 is quantifying prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among random samples of the population in England based on PCR testing of self-administered nose and throat swabs. Here we report results from the fifth round of observations for swabs collected from the 18th September to 5th October 2020. This report updates and should be read alongside our round 5 interim report.

MethodsRepresentative samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 175,000 people at each round. Prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimation of reproduction number (R) and time trends between and within rounds using exponential growth or decay models.

Results175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October. Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). These results correspond to 1 in 170 people currently swab-positive for the virus and approximately 45,000 new infections each day. At regional level, the highest prevalence is in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East with strongest regional growth in North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West Midlands.

ConclusionRapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England, with highest rates in the North of England. Prevalence has increased in all age groups, including those at highest risk. Improved compliance with existing policy and, as necessary, additional interventions are required to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and limit the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19.",Steven Riley; Kylie E.

239,Derivation and validation of a triage tool for acutely ill adults with suspected COVID-19: The PRIEST observational cohort study,"ObjectivesWe aimed to derive and validate a triage tool, based on clinical assessment alone, for predicting adverse outcome in acutely ill adults with suspected COVID-19 infection.

MethodsWe undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set.

ResultsWe analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.38 (0.38-0.39) for scores above four points.

ConclusionA clinical score based on NEWS2, age, sex, and performance status predicts adverse outcome with good discrimination in adults with suspected COVID-19 and can be used to support decision-making in emergency care.

240,Understanding the Los Angeles County Coronavirus Epidemic: The Critical Role of Intrahousehold Transmission,"We tracked the course of the COVID-19 epidemic among the approximately 300 communities comprising Los Angeles County. The epidemic, we found, had three distinct phases. During Phase I, from early March through about April 4, initial seeding of infection in relatively affluent areas was followed by radial geographic extension to adjoining communities. During Phase II, lasting until about July 11, COVID-19 cases continued to rise at a slower rate, and became increasingly concentrated in four geographic foci of infection across the county. Those communities with larger reductions in social mobility during April - as measured by the proportion of smartphones staying at home and number of smartphones visiting a gym - reported fewer COVID-19 cases in May. During Phase III, COVID-19 incidence only gradually declined, remaining as high as the incidence seen at the end of Phase I. Across communities, the prevalence of households at high risk for intergenerational transmission was strongly correlated with the persistence of continued COVID-19 propagation. This association was even stronger in those communities with a higher rate of gym attendance in Phase II. The map of the prevalence of at-risk households in Los Angeles County coincided strikingly with the map of cumulative COVID-19 incidence. These findings, taken together, support the critical role of household structure in the persistent propagation of COVID-19 infections in Los Angeles County. Public health policy needs to be reoriented from a focus on protecting the individual to a focus on protecting the household.",Jeffrey E Harris,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211045,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211045,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
241,Prioritisation of population groups with the most interactions for COVID-19 vaccination can substantially reduce total fatalities,"The rapid development of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an unprecedented achievement. Once vaccines become mass produced, they will have to be distributed to almost the entire population to prevent deaths and permit prompt economic recovery. The necessity to vaccinate a large number of people in a short period of time, and possibly with insufficient vaccine doses to cover most, creates in itself a new challenge for governments and health authorities: which population groups (by age or other criteria) should be targeted first and what sequence must be followed, if any at all, to achieve the minimum number of fatalities? In this work, we demonstrate the importance and impact of optimally planning the priorities for vaccine deployment by population groups using a modified SEIR-type model for the COVID-19 outbreak considering age-related groups. Finding the absolute guaranteed best solution of the mathematical optimisation problem may be hard, if even possible, and would likely require intense computational resources for every possible case study scenario. In this work, several strategies are evaluated and compared, in an attempt to approach the most effective possible vaccination priority sequence in an example case study using demographic and epidemiological data from Spain. The minimum total fatalities at the end of the vaccination campaign is the objective pursued. The population groups classifications are established based on relevant differences in mortality (due to their age) and risk-related behaviour such as their number of daily person-to-person interactions. Assuming a capacity limited constant vaccination rate, vaccination distribution strategies were evaluated for different vaccine effectiveness levels and different percentages of final vaccine population coverage. Our results unambiguously show how planning vaccination by priority groups can achieve dramatic reductions in total fatalities (more than 70% in some cases) compared to no prioritisation. The results also indicate in all cases, for all vaccine effectiveness and coverage values evaluated, that the criteria for groups vaccination priority should not be those with the highest mortality but rather those the highest number of daily person-to-person interactions. Strikingly, our results show in all cases, that prioritisation of groups with the highest mortality but less social interactions, may lead to significantly larger numbers of final total fatalities, even higher as if no group priorities were established at all. The explanation, clearly displayed by the mechanistic model, is that vaccination avoids infections that reduce mortality not only from the vaccinated group itself but also from the projected secondary and subsequent infections inflicted on the rest of the population by those vaccinated in that group. Precisely this amplification effect (exponential nature of the curve) appears to cause the larger reduction in total fatalities if the groups with the most interactions are vaccinated first. The possible contradiction of these results with some published recommendations highlight the importance of conducting an open comprehensive and rigorous analysis of this problem leaving behind any subjective preconceptions.",Jorge Rodriguez; Mauricio Paton; Juan M Acuna,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211094,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211094,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
242,COVID-19 in Italy: targeted testing as a proxy of limited health care facilities and a key to reducing hospitalization rate and the death toll.,"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) has induced a worldwide pandemic, notably in Italy, one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, which witnessed a death toll unseen in the recent past. There are potentially many factors, such as infections from undetected index cases, early vs late testing strategies, limited health care facilities etc., that might have aggravated the COVID-19 situation in Italy. We developed a COVID-19 specific infection epidemic model composed of susceptible (S), exposed (E), carrier (C), infected (I), recovery (R) and dead (D) (SECIRD), specifically parameterized for Italy to disentangle the impact of these factors and their implications on infection dynamics to help planning an effective control strategy for a possible second wave. Our model discriminates between detected infected and undetected individuals who played a crucial role in the disease spreading and is not well addressed by classical SEIR-like transmission models. We first estimated the number of undetected infections through a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, which ranges from [~] 7 to [~] 22 fold higher than reported infections, depending upon regions. We exploited this information to evaluate the impact of the undetected component on the evolution of the pandemic and the benefits of an enhanced testing strategy. In high testing regions like Veneto, 18% of all infections resulted in hospitalization, while for Lombardia and Piemonte, it is 25% and 27%, respectively. We investigated the impact of an overwhelmed health care system upon death toll by applying hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) capacities in the SECIRD model, and we estimated a 10% reduction in death in Lombardia, the worst hit region, if a higher number of hospital facilities had been available since the beginning. Adopting a combined strategy of rapid early and targeted testing ([~] 10 fold) with increased hospital capacity would help in avoiding bottlenecks affecting the health care system. Our results demonstrate that the early testing would have a strong impact on the overall hospital accessibility and, hence, upon death toll ([~]20% to 50% reduction) and could have mitigated the lack of facilities at the crucial middle stage of the epidemic.",Arnab Bandyopadhyay; Marta Schips; Tanmay Mitra; Sahamoddin Khailaie; Sebastian Binder; Michael Meyer-Hermann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211169,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211169,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
243,SARS-CoV-2 sequencing reveals rapid transmission from college student clusters resulting in morbidity and deaths in vulnerable populations,"College reopening decisions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represent a trade-off between competing risks to students, faculty and staff, and college finances. Additionally, risks taken in reopening colleges can impose significant burdens on individuals living in surrounding communities. Many colleges that reopened for in-person instruction have reported frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. La Crosse County, Wisconsin experienced a substantial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (2,002 cases in September 2020) that coincided with the return to in-person instruction at three local academic institutions. Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 cases in La Crosse during that period found rapid expansion of two viral substrains. Although the majority of cases were among college-age individuals, from a total of 111 genomes sequenced we identified rapid transmission of the virus into more vulnerable populations. Eight sampled genomes represented two independent transmission events into two skilled nursing facilities, resulting in two fatalities. Our study highlights the very significant risks imposed by college administrator reopening decisions, not just on college-associated populations, but on vulnerable individuals in surrounding communities.",Craig S Richmond; Arick P Sabin; Dean A Jobe; Steven D Lovrich; Paraic A Kenny,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20210294,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20210294,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
244,Early Crowdfunding Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundAs the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the US, policymakers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of online crowdfunding to defray these costs. We examined the online crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.

MethodsOn May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns created between January 1 and May 10, 2020 on GoFundMe and identified the subset of COVID-related campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored incidence of COVID-related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time and compared campaign characteristics to non-COVID-related campaigns after March 11 when the pandemic was declared.

ResultsWe found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe online crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-related campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 cases declined more than tenfold across all states. COVID-related campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period.

ConclusionsOnline crowdfunding appears to be a transient stopgap, predicated on the novelty of an emergency rather than the true sustained need of a community. Rather, crowdfunding activity is likely an early marker for communities in acute distress that could be used by governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.

246,Using Automated-Machine Learning to Predict COVID-19 Patient Survival: Identify Influential Biomarkers,"BackgroundIn a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to develop and compare between multiple machine learning (ML) models that predict the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection and identified the best-performing model. In addition, we investigated which biomarkers are the most influential in generating an accurate model. We believe an ML model such as this could be a useful tool for clinicians stratifying hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients.

MethodsThe data was retrospectively collected from Clinical Looking Glass (CLG) on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 through a nasopharyngeal specimen by real-time RT-PCR and admitted between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020 (4376 patients) at our institution. We collected 47 biomarkers from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity, and tracked whether a patient survived or not for one month following this time. We utilized the autoML from H2O.ai, an open source package for R language. The autoML generated 20 ML models and ranked them by area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) on the test set. We selected the best model (model_var_47) and chose a threshold probability that maximized F2 score to make a binary classifier: dead or alive. Subsequently, we ranked the relative importance of variables that generated model_var_47 and chose the 10 most influential variables. Next, we reran the autoML with these 10 variables and likewise selected the model with the best AUCPR on the test set (model_var_10). Again, threshold probability that maximized F2 score for model_var_10 was chosen to make a binary classifier. We calculated and compared the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicate value (PPV) for model_var_10 and model_var_47.

ResultsThe best model that autoML generated using all 47 variables was the stacked ensemble model of all models (AUCPR = 0.836). The most influential variables were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, troponin, and glucose. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 most important variables, it did not significantly affect the performance (AUCPR= 0.828). For the binary classifiers, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of model_var_47 was 83.6%, 87.7%, and 69.8% respectively, while for model_var_10 they were 90.9%, 71.1%, and 51.8% respectively.

ConclusionsBy using autoML, we developed high-performing models that predict patient mortality from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified the most important biomarkers correlated with mortality. This ML model can be used as a decision supporting tool for medical practitioners to efficiently triage COVID-19 infected patients. From our literature review, this will be the largest COVID-19 patient cohort to train ML models and the first to utilize autoML.

We found that the OraSure(R) test for total antibody detection in oral fluid had comparable sensitivity and specificity to serum-based ELISAs while presenting a more affordable and accessible system with the potential for self-collection.,Melanie A MacMullan; Prithivi Chellamuthu; Aubree Mades; Sudipta Das; Fred Turner; Vladimir I Slepnev; Albina Ibrayeva,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20210609,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20210609,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
248,"How Policies on Restaurants, Bars, Nightclubs, Masks, Schools, and Travel Influenced Swiss COVID-19 Reproduction Ratios","The role of complete lockdowns in reducing the reproduction ratios (Rt) of COVID-19 is now established. However, the persisting reality in many countries is no longer a complete lockdown, but restrictions of varying degrees using different choices of Non-pharmaceutical interaction (NPI) policies. A scientific basis for understanding the effectiveness of these graded NPI policies in reducing the Rt is urgently needed to address the concerns on personal liberties and economic activities. In this work, we develop a systematic relation between the degrees of NPIs implemented by the 26 cantons in Switzerland during March 9 - September 13 and their respective contributions to the Rt. Using a machine learning framework, we find that Rt which should ideally be lower than 1.0, has significant contributions in the post-lockdown scenario from the different activities - restaurants (0.0523 (CI. 0.0517-0.0528)), bars (0.030 (CI. 0.029-0.030)), and nightclubs (0.154 (CI. 0.154-0.156)). Activities which keep the land-borders open (0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178)), and tourism related activities contributed comparably 0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178). However, international flights with a quarantine did not add further to the Rt of the cantons. The requirement of masks in public transport and secondary schools contributed to an overall 0.025 (CI. 0.018-0.030) reduction in Rt, compared to the baseline usage even when there are no mandates. Although causal relations are not guaranteed by the model framework, it nevertheless provides a fine-grained justification for the relative merits of choice and the degree of the NPIs and a data-driven strategy for mitigating Rt.",C.

249,Use of antivirals and antibiotics for COVID-19 in Mexico City: A Real-World Multicenter Cohort Study,"We aimed to characterize real-world use of antivirals and antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 and their associations with mortality. We conducted a real-world retrospective cohort study in 688 primary-to-tertiary medical units in Mexico City; 395,343 patients were evaluated for suspected COVID-19 between February 24 and September 14, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (n=137,012) were included; those receiving unspecified antivirals (n=137), excluded, and groups of antivirals with <30 patients (n=20), eliminated. Survival and mortality risk analyses were done for patients receiving antivirals, antibiotics, both, or none (exposition groups). 136,855 patients were analyzed; mean age 44.2 (SD:16.8) years; 51.3% were men. 16.6% received an antiviral (3%), antibiotic (10%), or both (3.6%). More symptomatic patients received antivirals and antibiotics more often. Antivirals studied were Oseltamivir (n=8414), Amantadine (n=319), Lopinavir-Ritonavir (n=100), Rimantadine (n=61), Zanamivir (n=39), and Acyclovir (n=36). Survival with antivirals (73.7%, P<.001) and antibiotics (85.8%, P<.001) was lower than no antiviral/antibiotic (93.6%) in the general population. Increased risk of death was observed with antivirals in ambulatory (HR=4.7, 95%CI:3.94-5.62) and non-critical (HR=2.03, 95%CI:1.86-2.21) patients; no benefit in hospitalized and critical patients. Oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality in the general population (HR=1.72, 95%CI:1.61-1.84), ambulatory (HR=4.79, 95%CI:4.01-5.75), non-critical (HR=2.05, 95%CI:1.88-2.23), and pregnancy (HR=8.35, 95%CI:1.77-39.30). Antibiotics were a protective factor in hospitalized (HR=0.81, 95%CI:0.77-0.86) and critical patients (HR=0.67, 95%CI:0.63-0.72), but a risk factor in the general population (HR=1.13, 95%CI:1.08-1.19) and children and adolescents (HR=4.22, 95%CI:2.01-8.86). In conclusion, oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality or no benefit in all groups. Common antivirals for COVID-19 should be avoided. Antibiotics may increase survival in hospitalized and critical patients.

TB is a pandemic which has challenged mankind for ages and Covid 19 is a recent onset fast spreading pandemic. We study these two conditions with focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) based imaging, the role of digital chest x-ray and utility of end to end platform to improve turnaround times. Using artificial intelligence assisted technology for triage and creation of structured radiology reports using an end to end platform can ensure quick diagnosis. Changing dynamics of TB screening in the times of Covid 19 pandemic have resulted in bottlenecks for TB diagnosis.

251,Funding and COVID-19 Research Priorities - Are the research needs for Africa being met?,"IntroductionEmerging data from Africa indicates remarkably low numbers of reported COVID-19 deaths despite high levels of disease transmission. However evolution of these trends as the pandemic progresses remains unknown. More certain are the devastating long-term impacts of the pandemic on health and development evident globally. Research tailored to the unique needs of African countries is crucial.

UKCDR and GloPID-R have launched a tracker of funded COVID-19 projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and research priorities of Africa and less-resourced countries and published a baseline analysis of a Living Systematic Review (LSR) of these projects.

MethodsIn-depth analyses of the baseline LSR for COVID-19 funded research projects in Africa (as of 15th July 2020) to determine the funding landscape and alignment of the projects to research priorities of relevance to Africa.

ResultsThe limited COVID-19 related research across Africa appears to be supported mainly by international funding, especially from Europe, although with notably limited funding from United States-based funders. At the time of this analysis no research projects funded by an African-based funder were identified in the tracker although there are several active funding calls geared at research in Africa and there may be funding data which has not been made publicly available.

Many projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and 5 particular gaps in research funding were identified namely: investigating the role of children in COVID-19 transmission; effective modes of community engagement; health systems research; communication of uncertainties surrounding mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19; and identifying ways to promote international cooperation. Capacity strengthening was identified as a dominant theme in funded research project plans.

ConclusionsWe found significantly lower funding investments in COVID-19 research in Africa compared to High-Income Countries, seven months into the pandemic, indicating a paucity of research targeting the research priorities of relevance to Africa.

252,Implementing a Telemedicine Curriculum for Internal Medicine Residents during a Pandemic: The Cleveland Clinic Experience,"IntroductionTelemedicine is an important element of healthcare. However, until the COVID-19 pandemic, training in telemedicine was not a substantial element of most residency programs. Social distancing measures changed this. The Cleveland Clinic Internal Medicine Residency Program (IMRP) is one of the largest programs in the United States, which made the task of developing and adopting an effective, expedited telemedicine curriculum challenging. Our goal was to implement a system for teaching telemedicine care skills and supervising the care provided by residents during virtual visits.

MethodsThis study was started in April 2020. We developed and implemented a resident-led curriculum and training program for providing telemedicine care in less than five weeks. This entailed creating a formal training program for residents, creating a resource guide for the different video communication tools, and training preceptors to safely supervise care in this new paradigm. We also created an assessment instrument in our education evaluation system that allows residents to receive feedback on their performance during virtual appointments.

ResultsOver 2000 virtual visits were performed by residents in a span of 10 weeks. Of 148 residents, 38% responded to the pre-participation survey. A majority had no prior telemedicine experience and expressed only slight comfort with the modality.

DiscussionThrough collaboration with experienced residents and faculty, we expeditiously developed an enhancement to our ambulatory care curriculum to teach residents how to provide virtual care and help faculty with supervision.

253,Validation of a Derived International Patient Severity Phenotype to Support COVID-19 Analytics from Electronic Health Record Data,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSIntroductionC_ST_ABSThe Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) includes hundreds of hospitals internationally using a federated computational approach to COVID-19 research using the EHR.

ObjectiveWe sought to develop and validate a standard definition of COVID-19 severity from readily accessible EHR data across the Consortium.

MethodsWe developed an EHR-based severity algorithm and validated it on patient hospitalization data from 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also used a machine learning approach to compare selected predictors of severity to the 4CE algorithm at one site.

ResultsThe 4CE severity algorithm performed with pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of single code categories for acuity were unacceptably inaccurate - varying by up to 0.65 across sites. A multivariate machine learning approach identified codes resulting in mean AUC 0.956 (95% CI: 0.952, 0.959) compared to 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921) using expert-derived codes. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with 49% precision and recall compared against chart review at one partner institution.

DiscussionWe developed a proxy measure of severity that proved resilient to coding variability internationally by using a set of 6 code classes. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may tend to overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed discrepancies even in the gold standard outcomes, possibly due to pandemic conditions.

Using data from the New York Times and the American Community Survey, we assess the effect of this return to campus on viral case growth in counties with a significant college student population (""college counties"") relative to non-college counties. We find a significant surge in new cases in a 21-day time frame in college counties, a finding consistent across U.S. Census divisions.

255,Preventing COVID-19 spread in closed facilities by regular testing of employees - an efficient intervention in long-term care facilities and prisons,"BackgroundDraconic control measures were introduced to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), where in parts of the US, accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19.

Methods and findingsHere, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees in order to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group are investigated as well as the potential economic gain resulting from savings in COVID-19 related treatment costs in comparison to costs resulting from the testing interventions. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in the Federal Republic of Germany.

The probability is nearly one that COVID-19 spreads into closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Regular screening of all employees by PCR tests provides a significant reduction of COVID-19 cases and related deaths in LTCFs. While the frequency of testing (testing rate) and the quality of tests have noticeable effects, the waiting time for obtaining test results (ranging from 12 up to 96 hours) hardly impacts the outcome. The results suggest that testing every two weeks with low-quality tests and a processing time of up to 96 hours yields a strong reduction in the number of cases. Rough estimates suggest a significant economic gain.

ConclusionsThe introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. These measures provide an economically meaningful way to protect vulnerable risk groups characterized by an elevated risk of severe infections in closed facilities, in which contact-reducing measures are difficult to implement due to imminent unavoidable close human-to-human contacts.",Henri Christian Junior Tsoungui Obama; Nessma Adil Mahmoud Yousif; Looli Hassan Mohamed Alawam Nemer; Pierre Marie Ngougoue Ngougoue; Gideon Akumah Ngwa; Miranda Teboh-Ewungkem; Kristan Schneider,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211573,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211573,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

257,"Clinical characteristics, symptoms, management and health outcomes in 8,598 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to 27,510 with seasonal influenza in France, Spain and the US: a network cohort analysis","OBJECTIVESTo describe comorbidities, symptoms at presentation, medication use, and 30-day outcomes after a diagnosis of COVID-19 in pregnant women, in comparison to pregnant women with influenza.

DESIGNMultinational network cohort

SETTINGA total of 6 databases consisting of electronic medical records and claims data from France, Spain, and the United States.

PARTICIPANTSPregnant women with [&ge;] 1 year in contributing databases, diagnosed and/or tested positive, or hospitalized with COVID-19. The influenza cohort was derived from the 2017-2018 influenza season.

OUTCOMESBaseline patient characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms; 30-day inpatient drug utilization, maternal complications and pregnancy-related outcomes following diagnosis/hospitalization.

RESULTS8,598 women diagnosed (2,031 hospitalized) with COVID-19 were included. Hospitalized women had, compared to those diagnosed, a higher prevalence sof pre-existing comorbidities including renal impairment (2.2% diagnosed vs 5.1% hospitalized) and anemia (15.5% diagnosed vs 21.3% hospitalized).

The ten most common inpatient treatments were systemic corticosteroids (29.6%), enoxaparin (24.0%), immunoglobulins (21.4%), famotidine (20.9%), azithromycin (18.1%), heparin (15.8%), ceftriaxone (7.9%), aspirin (7.0%), hydroxychloroquine (5.4%) and amoxicillin (3.5%).

Compared to 27,510 women with influenza, dyspnea and anosmia were more prevalent in those with COVID-19. Women with COVID-19 had higher frequency of cesarean-section (4.4% vs 3.1%), preterm delivery (0.9% vs 0.5%), and poorer maternal outcomes: pneumonia (12.0% vs 2.7%), ARDS (4.0% vs 0.3%) and sepsis (2.1% vs 0.7%). COVID-19 fatality was negligible (N<5 in each database respectively).

CONCLUSIONSComorbidities that were more prevalent with COVID-19 hospitalization (compared to COVID-19 diagnosed) in pregnancy included renal impairment and anemia. Multiple medications were used to treat pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, some with little evidence of benefit. Anosmia and dyspnea were indicative symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnancy compared to influenza, and may aid differential diagnosis. Despite low fatality, pregnancy and maternal outcomes were worse in COVID-19 than influenza.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LICompared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age, pregnant women are less likely to experience typical COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever and myalgia.
C_LIO_LIObesity, high maternal age, and comorbid hypertension and diabetes are risk factors for severe COVID-19 among pregnant women.
C_LIO_LIDespite relatively high rates of pneumonia and need for oxygen supplementation, fatality rates in pregnant women with COVID-19 are generally low (<1%).
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIAlthough not often recorded, dyspnea and anosmia were more often seen in pregnant women with COVID-19 than in women with seasonal influenza, in 6 databases from 3 countries (US, France, Spain).
C_LIO_LIRenal impairment and anemia were more common among hospitalized than diagnosed women with COVID-19 during pregnancy.
C_LIO_LIDespite limited data on benefit-risk in pregnancy, a large number of medications were used for inpatient management of COVID-19 in pregnant women: approximately 1 in 3 received corticosteroids (some may have been given for a pregnancy-related indication rather than for COVID-19 treatment), 1 in 4 enoxaparin, and 1 in 5 immunoglobulin, famotidine and azithromycin.
C_LIO_LICompared to influenza, there was a higher frequency of pregnancy-related complications (cesarean section and preterm deliveries), as well as poorer maternal outcomes (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular and thromboembolic events) seen in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.

258,Persistent symptoms after Covid-19: qualitative study of 114 long Covid patients and draft quality criteria for services,"BackgroundApproximately 10% of patients with Covid-19 experience symptoms beyond 3-4 weeks. Patients call this ""long Covid"". We sought to document the lived experience of such patients, their accounts of accessing and receiving healthcare, and their ideas for improving services.

MethodWe held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their personal stories and comment on others stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, the clinical relationship, access to care, and service redesign.

ResultsThe sample was 70% female, aged 27-73 years, and comprised White British (74%), Asian (11%), White Other (7%), Black (4%), and Mixed (4%). 27 were doctors and 23 other health professionals. 10% had been hospitalised. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others felt ""fobbed off""); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotional touch points in participants experiences informed ideas for improving services.

ConclusionQuality principles for a long Covid service should include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.

259,Systematic analysis of electronic health records identifies drugs reducing risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and severity,"BACKGROUNDIt may take months to years until drugs specifically designed to treat COVID-19 are available. Until then, it is crucial to identify whether existing medications could have a protective effect against severe disease. This is the objective of this large population study performed in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel.

METHODSCHS centrally manages electronic health records (EHRs) including medication purchases for over 4.5 million members. Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess systematically which drugs affected the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization: in both cohorts, case patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; matched control patients were taken from the general population in the first cohort, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the second cohort. For each medication anatomical-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) class acquired during the last month before the index-date, we computed the odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95% confidence interval (CI), and the p-value, using Fishers exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing.

RESULTSSeveral drugs and pharmacy sold items were associated with significantly reduced odds for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, notably ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95% CI [0.058,0.458], p<0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.513, 95% CI [0.375,0.688], P<0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.746, 95% CI [0.645,0.858], p<0.001) and flecainide (OR=0.303, 95% CI [0.080,0.813], p<0.01). Additionally, acquisition of surgical masks, latex gloves and several ophthalmological products were associated with decreased risk for hospitalization.

CONCLUSIONUbiquinone, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway were associated with reduced hospitalization risk.

We performed an observational study to assess the impact of previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses on COVID-19 severity. 60 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were included (age 30 - 82 years; 52 males, 8 females): 19 inpatients with critical disease, 16 inpatients with severe or moderate disease and 25 outpatients (age and gender matched to inpatients). Patients with critical disease had significantly lower levels of HCoV OC43- (p=0.016) and HCoV HKU1-specific (p=0.023) antibodies at the first encounter compared to other COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses might protect against a severe course of disease.

261,Prone positioning of non-intubated patients with COVID-19 - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"PurposeSeveral studies have reported adopting prone positioning (PP) in non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related hypoxaemic respiratory failure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of PP on oxygenation and clinical outcomes.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase and COVID-19 living systematic review from December1st 2019 to July23rd 2020. We included studies that reported using PP in hypoxaemic, non-intubated adult COVID-19 patients. Primary outcome measure was the weighted mean difference (MD) in oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2 or SpO2) pre and post-PP.

ResultsFifteen single arm observational studies reporting PP in 449 patients were included. Substantial heterogeneity was noted in terms of, location within hospital where PP was instituted, respiratory supports, frequency and duration of PP. Significant improvement in oxygenation was reported post-PP: PaO2/FiO2, (MD 37.6, 95%CI 18.8, 56.5); PaO2, (MD 30.4 mmHg, 95%CI 10.9, 49.9); and SpO2, (MD 5.8%, 95%CI 3.7, 7.9). Patients with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 [&le;]150 experienced greater oxygenation improvements compared with those with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 >150 (MD 40.5, 95%CI -3.5, 84.6) vs. 37, 95%CI 17.1, 56.9). Respiratory rate decreased post-PP (MD -2.9, 95%CI -5.4, -0.4). Overall intubation and mortality rates were 21% (90/426) and 26% (101/390) respectively. No major adverse events were reported.

ConclusionsDespite significant variability in frequency and duration of PP and respiratory supports, PP was associated with improvements in oxygenation parameters without any reported serious adverse events. Major limitation being lack of control arm and adjustment for confounders. Clinical trials are required to determine the effect of awake PP on patient-centred outcomes.

262,Healthcare workers with mild / asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection show T cell responses and neutralising antibodies after the first wave,"Studies of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 include characterisation of lethal, severe and mild cases1-8. Understanding how long immunity lasts in people who have had mild or asymptomatic infection is crucial. Healthcare worker (HCW) cohorts exposed to and infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic are an invaluable resource to study this question9-14. The UK COVIDsortium is a longitudinal, London hospital HCW cohort, followed from the time of UK lockdown9,10 ; weekly PCR, serology and symptom diaries allowed capture of asymptomatic infection around the time of onset, so duration of immunity could be tracked. Here, we conduct a cross-sectional, case-control, sub-study of 136 HCW at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown, with 76 having had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 mild or asymptomatic infection. Neutralising antibodies (nAb) were present in 90% of infected HCW sampled after the first wave; titres, likely to correlate with functional protection, were present in 66% at 16-18 weeks. T cell responses tended to be lower in asymptomatic infected HCW than those reporting case-definition symptoms of COVID-19, while nAb titres were maintained irrespective of symptoms. T cell and antibody responses were discordant. HCW lacking nAb also showed undetectable T cells to Spike protein but had T cells of other specificities. Our findings suggest that the majority of HCW with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection carry nAb complemented by multi-specific T cell responses for at least 4 months after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Catherine J.

263,Epidemiologial Analysis of Patients Presenting to a West London District General Hospital Requiring Admission with Covid-19,"BackgroundCoronavirus has lead to significant morbidity and mortality both within the UK and worldwide. We hypothesise there are local clusters of coronavirus which would therefore be amenable to targeted public health measures.

MethodsThis is a retrospective, observational case series conducted in a West London District General Hospital. All patients admitted to hospital with a radiological or microbiological diagnosis of Covid-19 were included (children under 16 years were excluded). Consecutive sampling was used and baseline characteristics including age, sex, postcode and final patient outcome were collected from the electronic health records. Patient origin postcode was plotted to a map of the local area and an online cloud based mapping analysis system was used to generate heat maps and case density maps which were compared to living base layers. The primary outcome was identification of local clusters of cases of coronavirus. Secondary outcome was identification of population characteristics that may provide evidence for more targetted public health intervention in a second wave.

ResultsLocal clusters of infection were identified within the target population. These appeared to correlate with higher indices of deprivation, poorer overall health and high household occupancy suggesting a role for public health measures to target these areas.

264,Mathematical Perspective of Covid-19 Pandemic: Disease Extinction Criteria in Deterministic and Stochastic Models,"The world has been facing the biggest virological invasion in the form of Covid-19 pandemic since the beginning of the year 2020. In this paper, we consider a deterministic epidemic model of four compartments classified based on the health status of the populations of a given country to capture the disease progression. A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time basic reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period. Estimated cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases are 1,613,626 and 42,899, respectively, with case fatality rate 2.66 per cent till the deadly virus is eliminated from Spain.",Debadatta Adak; Abhijit Majumder; Nandadulal Bairagi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211201,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211201,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
265,A comparative study of infection and mortality in COVID-19 across countries: A scaling analysis,"Analysing infection and mortality data for COVID-19 as a function of days for 54 countries across all continents, we show that there is a simple scaling behaviour connecting these two quantities for any given nation when the data is segmented over few ranges of dates covering the most rapid spread of the pandemic and the recovery, wherever achieved. This scaling is described by two parameters, one representing a shift along the time axis and the other is a normalisation factor, providing a reliable definition of the mortality rate for each country in a given period. The number of segments for any country required in our analyses turns out to be surprisingly few with as many as 16 out of 54 countries being described by a single segment and no country requiring more than three segments. Estimates of the shift and mortality for these 54 countries in different periods show large spreads ranging over 0-16 days and 0.45-19.96%, respectively. Shift and mortality are found to be inversely correlated. Analyses of number of tests carried out for detecting COVID-19 and the number of infections detected due to such tests suggest that an effective way to increase the shift, and therefore, decrease mortality, is to increase number of tests per infection detected. This points to the need of a dynamic management of testing that should accelerate with the rise of the pandemic; it also suggests a basis for adjusting variations in the testing patterns in different geographical locations within a given country.",Ranjan Das; Akmal Hossain; Sayak Mandal; Debasmita Pariari; Rohit Kumar Rohj; Swapnil Shukla; Rahul Mahavir Varma; Dipankar Das Sarma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212175,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212175,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
266,School closures and SARS-CoV-2. Evidence from Sweden's partial school closure,"To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 most countries closed schools, despite uncertainty if school closures are an effective containment measure. At the onset of the pandemic, Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions. Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03-1.27]. Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52-2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00-1.68]. When analyzing COVID-19 diagnoses from healthcare visits and the incidence of severe health outcomes, results are similar for teachers but somewhat weaker for parents and teachers partners. The results for parents indicate that keeping lower secondary schools open had minor consequences for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in society. The results for teachers suggest that measures to protect teachers could be considered.",Jonas Vlachos; Edvin Hertegard; Helena B Svaleryd,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211359,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211359,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
267,A delayed modulation of solar radiation on the COVID-19 transmission reflects an incubation period,"Laboratory experiments have revealed the meteorological sensitivity of the virus of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no consensus has been reached about how the meteorological conditions modulate the virus transmission as it is constrained more often by non-meteorological factors. Here, we find that the non-meteorological factors constrain statistically-least the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases in a country when the cases arrive around 2500-3000. The least-constrained growth rate correlates with the near-surface ultraviolet flux and temperature significantly (correlation coefficients r=-0.55{+/-}0.08 and -0.45{+/-}0.08 at p < 10-5, respectively). In response to increases of 1W/m2 ultraviolet and 1{degrees}C temperature, the growth rate decreases by 0.33{+/-}0.11% and 0.18{+/-}0.08% per day, respectively. The response to the ultraviolet flux exhibits a delay by about 7 days, providing an independent measure of the incubation period.

268,What is the evidence for transmission of COVID-19 by children in schools? A living systematic review,"BackgroundIt is of paramount importance to understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools, which could support the decision-making about educational facilities closure or re-opening with effective prevention and control measures in place.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. We performed risk of bias evaluation of all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Results2,178 articles were retrieved and 11 studies were included. Five cohort studies reported a combined 22 student and 21 staff index cases that exposed 3,345 contacts with 18 transmissions [overall infection attack rate (IAR): 0.08% (95% CI: 0.00%-0.86%)]. IARs for students and school staff were 0.15% (95% CI: 0.00%-0.93%) and 0.70% (95% CI: 0.00%-3.56%) respectively. Six cross-sectional studies reported 639 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 6,682 study participants tested [overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate: 8.00% (95% CI: 2.17%-16.95%)]. SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was estimated to be 8.74% (95% CI: 2.34%-18.53%) among students, compared to 13.68% (95% CI: 1.68%-33.89%) among school staff. Gender differences were not found for secondary infection (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.50-4.14, P= 0.49) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.72-1.13, P= 0.36) in schools. Fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, asthenia, and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (based on two studies). Overall, study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias, limiting the confidence in the results.

ConclusionsThere is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff.

270,"Precautionary breaks: planned, limited duration circuit breaks to control the prevalence of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (early March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days (growth rate r {approx} 0.2). The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic quantities (r {approx} -0.06) that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed (r {approx} -0.02). Since August, infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been rising (precise estimation of the current growth rate is difficult due to extreme regional heterogeneity and temporal lags between the different epidemiological observations) and various NPIs have been applied locally throughout the UK in response.

Controlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Currently, NPI imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such emergency NPIs are required. These ""precautionary breaks"" may offer a means of keeping control of the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their society impact. Here, using simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the unfolding UK epidemic, we investigate the action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of infection, as well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths. We find that precautionary breaks provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures (such as contact tracing) to regain control.",Matt J Keeling; Glen Guyver-Fletcher; Alexander Holmes; Louise J Dyson; Michael Tildesley; Edward M Hill; Graham F Medley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211813,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211813,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
271,Nonspecific blood tests as proxies for COVID-19 hospitalization: are there plausible associations after excluding noisy predictors?,"This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.",Gerson Ishikawa; Graziela Argenti; Cristina Berger Fadel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211557,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211557,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

During this period, children and their families were exposed to a full-time home life. The aim of this study was to assess the emotional experience and tolerance of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in this particular context.

MethodA clinical survey was proposed to parents and rated by professionals once a week during the quarantine period in France. 95 autistic children followed by the child and adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital were assessed from the 18th of March to the 8th of May. The following clinical points were investigated: child anxiety, family anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on appetite, impact on school work, family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to follow a schedule, isolation behavior.

ResultsDespite minor changes in family anxiety and school work, no difference was highlighted between clinical scores collected at the beginning and at the end of this period. ASD children with or without intellectual disability had non-significant clinical changes during quarantine. This evolution was also independent of the accommodation type (house or apartment) and the parental status (relationship, separated or isolated).

273,Circulating Proteins Influencing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: a Mendelian Randomization Study,"Proteins detectable in peripheral blood may influence COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. However, understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be influenced by COVID-19 itself and also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and reduces bias due to confounding and reverse causation. We began by identifying the genetic determinants of 955 circulating proteins in up to 10,708 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide polymorphisms near the gene encoded by the circulating protein. We then undertook an MR study to estimate the effect of these proteins on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the Host Genetics Initiative. We found that a standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 2,972 cases / 284,472 controls; OR = 0.48, P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,492 / 1,012,809; OR = 0.60, P = 2x10-7) and COVID-19 susceptibility (N = 17,607 / 1,345,334; OR = 0.81, P = 6x10-5). Results were consistent despite multiple sensitivity analyses probing MR assumptions. OAS1 is an interferon-stimulated gene that promotes viral RNA degradation. Other potentially implicated proteins included IL10RB.

With passing days post-onset, the level of IL-6 expression in severe illness approaches that in moderate illness. The data are consistent with IL-6 acting as a driver of NETosis in the early phase of severe COVID-19 illness, that results in a vicious cycle of NETosis-complement/coagulation-respiratory dysfunction.

277,Innate lymphoid cell composition associates with COVID-19 disease severity,"ObjectivesThe role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unknown. Understanding the immune response in COVID-19 could contribute to unravel the pathogenesis and identification of treatment targets. To describe the phenotypic landscape of circulating ILCs in COVID-19 patients and to identify ILC phenotypes correlated to serum biomarkers, clinical markers, and laboratory parameters relevant in COVID-19.

MethodsBlood samples collected from moderately (n=11) and severely ill (n=12) COVID-19 patients as well as healthy control donors (n=16), were analyzed with 18-parameter flow cytometry. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we examined the ILC activation status and homing profile. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained from all COVID-19 patients and serum biomarkers were analyzed with multiplex immunoassays.

ResultsILCs were largely depleted from the circulation of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and ILCp, and ILC1, respectively. The activated ILC profile of COVID-19 patients was associated with soluble inflammatory markers, while frequencies of ILC subsets were correlated with laboratory parameters that reflect the disease severity.

278,Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on People with Hypertension,"ObjectivesIt is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are needed.

DesignThis retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions.

MethodsBaseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender, education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions, prevention intentions and anxiety were measured.

ResultsAt baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%).

ConclusionsAnxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.",Carissa Bonner; Erin Cvejic; Julie Ayre; Jennifer Isautier; Christopher Semsarian; Brooke Nickel; Carys Batcup; Kristen Pickles; Rachael Dodd; Samuel Cornell; Tessa Copp; Kirsten J McCaffery,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
279,Frontline healthcare workers' experiences with personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a rapid qualitative appraisal,"ObjectivesTo report frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) experiences with personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. To understand HCWs fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145,000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). HCWs interviewed were from secondary care, primary care and specialist community clinics. Media and policy data were from across the UK.

ResultsA major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national-level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to re-use and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about inequitable access to PPE for community, lower seniority, female and ethnic minority HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use.

ConclusionThis study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use, as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance. These needs must be addressed in order to protect the health and well-being of the most valuable healthcare resource in the COVID-19 pandemic: our HCWs.

O_TEXTBOXWhat is already known?- PPE is an important component of infection prevention and control to protect HCWs delivering care on the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak.
- Frontline HCWs have reported challenges delivering care in PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Research understanding how HCWs responded to these challenges are lacking.


What are the new findings?- HCWs faced multiple challenges delivering care including inadequate provision of PPE, inconsistent guidance and lack of training in its use.
- HCWs persisted delivering care despite the negative physical effects, practical problems, lack of protected time for breaks and communication barriers associated with wearing PPE.
- In the face of training, guidance and procurement gaps, HCWs improvised by developing their own informal communication channels to share information, they trained each other and bought their own PPE.
- HCWs reported inequalities accessing PPE based on the healthcare sector, gender, level of seniority and ethnicity.


What do the new findings imply?- To feel safe and confident caring for patients, frontline HCWs need to be provided with appropriate size, quality and level of PPE, as well as training in its use.
- PPE guidance should be consistent, clearly communicated, and reflect the most up-to-date evidence-base for the safest level of PPE.
- Regular breaks for staff working in full PPE should be prioritised even in contexts of understaffing and PPE shortages as these are key aspects of well-being.

Sociodemographic, health-related, behavioral, and COVID-19-related characteristics were collected. Among 2055 participants, non-adherence was associated with male gender, young age, bachelorhood, being employed, lower decrease in income, low physical activity, psychological distress, ADHD symptoms, past risk-taking and anti-social behavior, low pro-sociality, perceived social norms favoring non-adherence, low perceived risk of COVID-19, low perceived efficacy of the preventive measures, and high perceived costs of adherence to the preventive measures.

282,Post mortem pathological findings in COVID-19 cases: A Systematic Review,"BackgroundThe current COVID-19 pandemic is considered one of the most serious public health crisis over the last few decades. Although the disease can result in diverse, multiorgan pathology, there have been very few studies addressing the postmortem pathological findings of the cases. Active autopsy amid this pandemic could be an essential tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and research.

ObjectiveTo provide a total picture of the SARS-CoV-2 histopathological features of different body organs in postmortem autopsies through a systematic search of the published literature.

MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google scholar, Medrxiv & Biorxiv) was carried out from December 2019 to August, 15th 2020, for journal articles of different study designs reporting postmortem pathological findings in COVID-19 cases. PRISMA guidelines were used for reporting the review.

ResultsA total of 50 articles reporting 430 cases were included in our analysis. Postmortem pathological findings were reported for different body organs, pulmonary system (42 articles), cardiovascular system (23 articles), hepatobiliary system (22 articles), kidney (16 articles), spleen, and lymph nodes (12 articles), and central nervous system (7 articles). In lung samples, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most commonly reported findings in 239 cases (84.4%). Myocardial hypertrophy (87 cases by 51.2%), arteriosclerosis (121 cases by 62%), and steatosis (118 cases by 59.3%) were the most commonly reported pathological findings in the heart, kidney, and hepatobiliary system respectively.

283,"Coronavirus Disease-2019 Case, Death, and Testing Rates in the United States and Worldwide: Primary Data and Review","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with a world-wide pandemic, with the United States (US) having the largest total number of cases and deaths (>7 million and >200,000, respectively) at this time. We assessed data as of September 1, 2020 from our combined laboratories and as reported for selected states and countries for case, death, and testing rates per 1 million in the population. Our goal was to elucidate potential causes for the large rate differences observed. SARS-CoV-2 naso-pharyngeal (NP) RNA swab testing in 985,219 US subjects referred to our laboratories by healthcare providers revealed an overall 10.1% positive rate, comparable to the 7.3% rate reported nationwide. In a small subset of 91 subjects, all of whom had been positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP swabs 2-4 weeks earlier, NP swab testing was twice as likely to be positive (58.6%) as saliva samples (21.5%), based on paired sampling. Our positive rates per state agreed reasonably well with reported Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data (r=0.609, P<0.0001) based on 19,898 cases, 593 deaths, and 271,637 tests, all per 1 million in the US population. Louisiana had the highest case rate; New Jersey had the highest death rate; and Rhode Island had the highest testing rate. Of 47 countries, including all countries with populations >50 million, Qatar had the highest case rate; Peru had the highest death rate; and Israel had the highest testing rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Correlations between case rates and death rates as well as testing rates were 0.473 and 0.398 for US states and 0.488 and 0.395 for the various countries, respectively (all P<0.0001). In conclusion, outpatient saliva testing is not as sensitive as NP testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

Of greatest interest is the ~300 amino acid receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit of the spike protein because of its key interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor present on many cell types, especially lung epithelial cells. We report here the development and functional characterization of 29 nanomolar-affinity mouse SARS-CoV-2 mAbs created by an accelerated immunization and hybridoma screening process.

285,Therapeutic activity of an inhaled potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibody in hamsters,"SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract, enabling transmission and often leading to substantial lung pathology. Delivering the antiviral treatment directly to the lungs has the potential to improve lung bioavailability and dosing efficiency. As the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) is increasingly deemed to be a clinically validated target, RBD-specific B cells were isolated from patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection to derive a panel of fully human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The most potent hmAb, 1212C2 was derived from an IgM memory B cell, has high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD which enables its direct inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2. The 1212C2 hmAb exhibits in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters when delivered intraperitoneally, achieving a meaningful reduction in upper and lower respiratory viral burden and lung pathology. Furthermore, liquid nebulized inhale treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters with as low as 0.6 mg/kg of inhaled dose, corresponding to approximately 0.03 mg/kg of lung deposited dose, mediated a reduction in respiratory viral burden that is below the detection limit, and mitigated lung pathology. The therapeutic efficacy achieved at an exceedingly low-dose of inhaled 1212C2 supports the rationale for local lung delivery and achieving dose-sparing benefits as compared to the conventional parenteral route of administration. Taken together, these results warrant an accelerated clinical development of 1212C2 hmAb formulated and delivered via inhalation for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Michael S Piepenbrink; Jun-Gyu Park; Fatai Oladunni; Ashlesha Deshpande; Madhubanti Basu; Sanghita Sarkar; Andreas Loos; Jennifer Woo; Phillip Lovalenti; Derek Sloan; Chengjin Ye; Kevin Chiem; Nathaniel B Erdmann; Paul A Goepfert; Vu L Truong; Mark R Walter; Luis Martinez-Sobrido; James J Kobie,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339150,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339150,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False

Through experimental co-infection of IAV with either pseudotyped or SARS-CoV-2 live virus, we found that IAV pre-infection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types. Remarkably, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice co-infected with IAV in vivo. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not seen with several other viruses probably due to a unique IAV segment as an inducer to elevate ACE2 expression.

The initial step to identifying potential candidates usually involves in vitro screening. Here we describe a simple rapid bioassay for drug screening using Vero E6 cells and inhibition of cytopathic effects (CPE) measured using crystal violet staining. The assay clearly illustrated the anti-viral activity of remdesivir, a drug known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. A key refinement involves a simple growth assay to identify drug concentrations that cause cellular stress or ""cytomorbidity"", as distinct from cytotoxicity or loss of viability.

Although viral RNA modification has been reported based on the transcriptome architecture, the types and functions of RNA modification are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in SARS-CoV-2. Our methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m6A modification. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection not only increased the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) but also altered its distribution. Modification of METTL3 expression by short hairpin RNA or plasmid transfection for knockdown or overexpression, respectively, affected viral replication. Furthermore, the viral key protein RdRp interacted with METTL3, and METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the presence of RdRp. RdRp appeared to modulate the sumoylation and ubiquitination of METTL3 via an unknown mechanism.

290,"ACIS, A Novel KepTide™, Binds to ACE-2 Receptor and Inhibits the Infection of SARS-CoV2 Virus in vitro in Primate Kidney Cells: Therapeutic Implications for COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a virus known as SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Without a targeted-medicine, this disease has been causing a massive humanitarian crisis not only in terms of mortality, but also imposing a lasting damage to social life and economic progress of humankind. Therefore, an immediate therapeutic strategy needs to be intervened to mitigate this global crisis. Here, we report a novel KepTide (Knock-End Peptide) therapy that nullifies SARS-CoV2 infection. SARS-CoV2 employs its surface glycoprotein ""spike"" (S-glycoprotein) to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its infection in host cells. Based on our in-silico-based homology modeling study validated with a recent X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB ID:6M0J), we have identified that a conserved motif of S-glycoprotein that intimately engages multiple hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions with ACE-2 enzyme. Accordingly, we designed a peptide, termed as ACIS (ACE-2 Inhibitory motif of Spike), that displayed significant affinity towards ACE-2 enzyme as confirmed by biochemical assays such as BLItz and fluorescence polarization assays. Interestingly, more than one biochemical modifications were adopted in ACIS in order to enhance the inhibitory action of ACIS and hence called as KEpTide. Consequently, a monolayer invasion assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that KEpTide efficiently mitigated the infection of SARS-CoV2 in vitro in VERO E6 cells. Finally, evaluating the relative abundance of ACIS in lungs and the potential side-effects in vivo in mice, our current study discovers a novel KepTide therapy that is safe, stable, and robust to attenuate the infection of SARS-CoV2 virus if administered intranasally.",Avik Roy; Gunnar Gottschalk; Konstance Knox; Chi Hao Luan; Jim Keating; Kris Kesler,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337584,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337584,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False

292,Structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 degrades with temperature,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.

Statement of Scientific SignificanceThe economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are very significant. However scientific information needed to underpin policy decisions are limited partly due to novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. There is therefore an urgent need for mechanistic studies of both COVID-19 disease and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We show that individual virus particles suffer structural destabilization at relatively mild but elevated temperatures. Our nanoscale results are consistent with recent observations at larger scales.

293,"Obesity alters Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in lung, trachea, and esophagus in a sex-dependent manner: Implications for COVID-19","Obesity is a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. The underlying basis of this association is likely complex in nature. The host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for viral cell entry. It is unclear whether obesity alters expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in the lower respiratory tract. Here, we show that: 1) Ace2 expression is elevated in the lung and trachea of diet-induced obese male mice and reduced in the esophagus of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 2) Tmprss2 expression is increased in the trachea of obese male mice but reduced in the lung and elevated in the trachea of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 3) in chow-fed lean mice, females have higher expression of Ace2 in the lung and esophagus as well as higher Tmprss2 expression in the lung but lower expression in the trachea compared to males; and 4) in diet-induced obese mice, males have higher expression of Ace2 in the trachea and higher expression of Tmprss2 in the lung compared to females, whereas females have higher expression of Tmprss2 in the trachea relative to males. Our data indicate diet- and sex-dependent modulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in the lower respiratory tract and esophagus.

294,Immunogenicity of novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine MRT5500 in mice and non-human primates,"An effective vaccine to address the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an urgent public health priority1. Novel synthetic mRNA and vector-based vaccine technologies offer an expeditious development path alternative to traditional vaccine approaches. Here we describe the efforts to utilize an mRNA platform for rational design and evaluations of mRNA vaccine candidates based on Spike (S) glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Several mRNA constructs expressing various structural conformations of S-protein, including wild type (WT), a pre-fusion stabilized mutant (2P), a furin cleavage-site mutant (GSAS) and a double mutant form (2P/GSAS), were tested in a preclinical animal model for their capacity to elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). The lead 2P/GSAS candidate was further assessed in dose-ranging studies in mice and Cynomolgus macaques. The selected 2P/GSAS vaccine formulation, now designated MRT5500, elicited potent nAbs as measured in two types of neutralization assays. In addition, MRT5500 elicited TH1-biased responses in both mouse and non-human primate species, a result that helps to address a hypothetical concern regarding potential vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases associated with TH2-biased responses. These data position MRT5500 as a viable vaccine candidate for clinical development against COVID-19.",Kirill V Kalnin; Timothy Plitnik; Michael Kishko; Jinrong Zhang; Donghui Zhang; Andrien Beauvais; Natalie G Anosova; Timothy Tibbitts; Joshua M DiNapoli; Po-Wei D Huang; James Huleatt; Deanne Vincent; Katherine Fries; Shrirang Karve; Rebecca Goldman; Hardip Gopani; Anusha Dias; Khang Tran; Minnie Zacharia; Xiaobo Gu; Lianne Boeglin; Sudha Chivukula; Ron Swearingen; Victoria Landolfi; Tong-Ming Fu; Frank DeRosa; Danilo Casimiro,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.337535,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.337535,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False
295,The viral protein NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper for shutting down host translation and fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine  Achille heel of the virus.",Antonin Tidu; Aurelie Janvier; Laure Schaeffer; Piotr Sosnowski; Lauriane Kuhn; Philippe Hammann; Eric Westhof; Gilbert Eriani; Franck Martin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339515,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339515,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False
296,Use of convalescent serum reduces severity of COVID-19 in nonhuman primates,"Passive transfer of convalescent plasma or serum is a time-honored strategy for treating infectious diseases. Human convalescent plasma containing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is currently being used to treat COVID-19 patients. However, most patients have been treated outside of randomized clinical trials making it difficult to determine the efficacy of this approach. Here, we assessed the efficacy of convalescent sera in a newly developed African green monkey model of COVID-19. Groups of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals were treated with pooled convalescent sera containing either high or low to moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Differences in viral load and disease pathology were minimal between monkeys that received the lower titer convalescent sera and untreated controls. However, and importantly, lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory compartments, reduced gross and histopathological lesion severity in the lungs, and reductions in several parameters associated with coagulation and inflammatory processes were observed in monkeys that received convalescent sera versus untreated controls. Our data support human studies suggesting that convalescent plasma therapy is an effective strategy if donors with high level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are employed and if recipients are at an early stage of disease.",robert cross; Abhishek N Prasad; Viktoriya Borisevich; Courtney Woolsey; Krystle N Agans; Daniel J.

297,Associations between governor political affiliation and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States,"IntroductionAs the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly politicized in the United States (US), political party affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. We examined differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates stratified by governor party affiliation across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC).

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal analysis examining daily COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 through September 30, 2020, for each US state and DC. We fit a Bayesian negative binomial model to estimate adjusted daily risk ratios (RRs) and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing infection and death rates by gubernatorial (mayoral for DC) party affiliation. We adjusted for several state-level variables, including population density, age, race, poverty, and health.

ResultsFrom March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had, on average, lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. However, on June 8, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher per capita COVID-19 incidence rates (RR=1.15, 95% PI: 1.02, 1.25). This trend persisted until September 30 (RR=1.26, 95% PI: 0.96, 1.51). For death rates, Republican-led states had lower average rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 13 (RR=1.22, 95% PI: 1.03,1.37) through September 30 (RR=1.74, 95% PI: 1.20, 2.24).

ConclusionGubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the US.

298,"Findings from serological surveys (in August 2020) to assess the exposure of adult population to SARS Cov-2 infection in three cities of Odisha, India.","BackgroundThere is always an uncertainty of epidemiological, serological infectivity and virulence of the emerging novel coronavirus. Antibody test can be used for assessing whether immunity has developed in the infected person after 5-7 days of illness and understand cumulative exposure levels to the infection, make inferences on the actual burden of infection, its geographical spread, effect on specific demographic/risk groups, gaps in testing and infection fatality rates.

ObjectiveTo estimate and compare the sero-prevalence, hidden prevalence and determine the demographic risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in three largest cities of Odisha, India.

MethodologyThis was a population based cross sectional serological survey carried out in August 2020 in the three largest cities of the state of Odisha. Sample size per city was estimated to be 1500 and participants were enrolled from the community using multi-stage random sampling from 25 clusters from each city. Data was collected using ODK based tools by household visits and 3-4 ml of blood samples were collected after informed consent. Samples were transported to testing lab where Serum was separated and tested for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies using automated CLIA platform. Statistical analysis was done using R-software packages.

ResultsA total of 4146 participants from the 3 cities of Bhubaneswar (BBS), Berhampur (BAM) and Rourkela (RKL) participated. A total of 5635 households were approached and the average non response rate in the community was 17.4%. The gender weighted seroprevalence across the three cities was 20.78% (95% CI: 19.56%-22.05%). Seroprevalence was highest in BAM at 31.14% (95% CI: 28.69-33.66%) followed by 24.59% (95% CI: 22.39-26.88%) in RKL and 5.24% (95% CI: 4.10-6.58%) in BBS. While females reported a higher seroprevalence (22.8%) as compared to males (18.8%), there was no significant difference in seroprevalence across age groups. A majority of the seropositive participants were asymptomatic (93.87%). Among those who reported symptoms, the most common symptom was fever (68.89%) followed by cough (46.06%) and myalgia (32.67%). The case to infection ratio on the date of serosurvey was 1: 6.6 in BBS, 1:61 in BAM and 1:29.8 in RKL.

299,SARS-CoV-2 waves in Europe: A 2-stratum SEIRS model solution,"In order to design actionable SARS-CoV-2 strategies, we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable individuals. At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform, showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns. Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer non-uniform isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the <60 to >60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 43%; Catalonia 24%; Brussels 73%; and Stockholm 65%) are closer to reality. In locations where we didnt find reliable serology, we performed immunity estimations assuming Spains serology ratio (Paris: 24%; London: 34%). We predict that, with the exception of Brussels, no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller one). For locations far from the herd immunity threshold (HIT) we searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths, shockingly all found isolations for healthy <60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final deaths). Then, assuming an ideal 1-day long vaccination campaign with a 77% efficacy vaccine, we compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180-day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy <60 and results in 0.65 isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy <60 (i.e. schools and workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: March 7 2021; Catalonia: Dec 26 2020; Paris: Jan 12 2021; London: Jan 25 2021).

300,Estimating COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on-stream through phone-calls,"One of the main problems in controlling COVID-19 epidemic spread is the delay in confirming cases. Having information on changes in the epidemic evolution or outbreaks rise before lab-confirmation is crucial in decision making for Public Health policies. We present an algorithm to estimate on-stream the number of COVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line. By modeling the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with coefficient of determination R2 > 0.85. This result allows us to estimate the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days before the lab results are available. We validate the algorithm with real data. We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance to lab results. One key point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a main indicator to detect an anomaly. We present the details of the explicit example in Villa Azul (Quilmes) where this tool resulted crucial to control an outbreak on time.

301,Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with learning disabilities: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to July 2020,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a widespread impact on mental healthcare service provision and use. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemics first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with learning disabilities across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st July 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with learning disabilities. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with learning disabilities over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March (or a 282% increase if the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was considered alone).",Evangelia Martin; Eleanor Nuzum; Matthew Broadbent; Robert Stewart,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
302,EVALUATION OF ELEVEN IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHIC ASSAYS FOR SARS-CoV-2 DETECTION: INVESTIGATING DENGUE CROSS-REACTION,"BackgroundCOVID-19 disease (Coronavirus disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is widespread worldwide, affecting more than 11 million people globally (July 6th, 2020). Diagnostic techniques have been studied in order to contain the pandemic. Immunochromatographic (IC) assays are feasible and low cost alternative for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the population.

MethodsHere we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of eleven different immunochromatographic tests in 98 serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 through RT-PCR and 100 negative serum samples from blood donors collected in February 2019. Considering the endemic situation of Dengue in Brazil, we also evaluated the cross-reactivity with Dengue using 20 serum samples from patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue collected in early 2019 through four different tests.

ResultsOur results demonstrated agreement between immunochromatographic assays and RT-PCR, especially after 10 days since the onset of symptoms. The evaluation of IgG and IgM antibodies combined demonstrated a strong level of agreement (0.85) of IC assays and RT-PCR. It was observed cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 using four different IC assays for COVID-19 diagnosis. The specificity of IC assays to detected COVID-19 IgM antibodies using Dengue serum samples varied from 80% to 85%; the specificity of IgG detection was 100% and total antibody was 95%.

ConclusionsWe found high sensitivity, specificity and good agreement of IC assays, especially after 10 days onset of symptoms. However, we detected cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 mainly with IgM antibodies demonstrating the need for better studies about diagnostic techniques for these diseases.

MethodsWe performed a literature search of clinical trials, cohorts, and case series using PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library, and downloadable database of CDC. We excluded case reports and searched all-language articles for review and repeated until the final drafting. The search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database.

ResultsThirty studies with urinary sampling for viral shedding were included. A total number of 1,271 patients were enrolled initially, among which 569 patients had undergone urinary testing. Nine studies observed urinary viral shedding in urine from 41 patients. The total incidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%, compared to 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood and stool, respectively. The summarized risk ratio (RR) estimates for urine positive rates compared to the pharyngeal rate was 0.08. The pertaining RR urine compared to blood and stool positive rates were 0.20 and 0.33 respectively.

ConclusionsOur review concludes that not only the SARS-CoV-2 can be excreted in the urine in eight percent of patients but also its incidence may have associations with the severity of the systemic disease, ICU admission, and fatality rates. Moreover, the findings in our review suggest that a larger population size may reveal more positive urinary cases possibly by minimizing biases.

306,Extracorporeal Blood Purification in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients: a prospective cohort study,"IntroductionCOVID-19 is characterised by hyperinflammation and coagulopathy. Severe cases often develop respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and critical cases progressing to ARDS. Control of hyperinflammation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic avenue for COVID-19; extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modalities offer an attractive mean to ameliorate maladaptive inflammation.

With this work, we describe the longitudinal variation of parameters of systemic inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with blood purification using AN69ST (oXiris(R)) hemodiafilter.

MethodsWe performed a time-series analysis of 44 consecutive COVID-19 cases treated with the AN69ST (oXiris(R)) cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter; we visualise longitudinal results of biochemical, inflammatory, blood gas- and vital sign parameters.

ResultsBlood purification was indicated for suspected hyperinflammation or hypercoagulation, (= CRP [&ge;] 100 mg/L and/or IL-6 [&ge;] 40 pg/mL and/or Ferritin [&ge;] 500 ng/mL and/or Lactate Dehydrogenase > 365 U/L or D-dimers > 2000 ng/mL). All patients were treated with [&ge;] 1 cycle extracorporeal continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVHF) with cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter (CAH); of these, 30 severe patients received CVVHF-CAH within 4 - 12 hours of hospitalisation. Another 14 patients admitted with mild-to-moderate symptoms progressed to severe disease and placed on EBP during the course of hospitalisation. The treatment was associated with a reduction of Ferritin, C-reactive protein, Fibrinogen, several inflammatory markers and a resolution of numerous cytopenias. The observed mortality across the cohort was 36.3% across the cohort.

Despite strong efforts that have been taking place to control the pandemic globally, the virus is on the rise in many countries. Hence, this study assessed the maternal health care services utilization in the amid of the COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia. Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interview using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables. A P-value of <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. The prevalence of maternal health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.8%. The odds of maternal health service utilization was higher among mothers who had primary (AOR=2.16, 95%CI: 1.29-3.60), secondary (AOR=1.97, 95%CI: 1.13-3.44), and college and above education (AOR=2.89, 95%CI: 1.34-6.22) than those who could not read and write.

308,Duration of Oxygen Requirement and Predictors in Severe COVID-19 Patients in Ethiopia: A Survival Analysis,"AimTo estimate time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and identify predictors among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodsA prospective observational study was conducted among 244 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients from July to September, 2020. Frequency tables, KM plots, median survival times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to assess the presence of a statistically significant association between time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and the independent variables, where hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsMedian time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among the studied population was 6 days. Factors that affect time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy were age group (HR= 0.522, 95% CI= 0.323, 0.844, p-value=0.008 for [&ge;] 70 years) and shortness of breath (HR= 0.705, 95% CI= 0.519, 0.959, p-value=0.026).

ConclusionsAverage duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19 patients was 6 days and being 70 years and older and having shortness of breath were found to be associated with prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement. This result can be used as a guide in planning institutional resource allocation and patient management to provide a well equipped care to prevent complications and death from the disease.",Tigist W Leulseged; Ishmael S Hassen; Mesay G Edo; Daniel S Abebe; Endalkachew H Maru; Wuletaw C Zewde; Nigat W Chamesew; Tarik B Jagema,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209122,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209122,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

310,COVID-19 trends in Colombian regions with the highest disease burden,"IntroductionCOVID-19 pandemic is currently the most significant global public health challenge, with more than 31 million cases reported to date. Colombia first reported COVID-19 cases in the country by early March 2020, and six months later it has reached [~]750,471 clinical cases, with significant regional differences in morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization rates.

AimsIdentify population characteristics and hospital capacity in the 13 municipalities with the highest disease notification and examine differences in cumulative reported cases, hospitalization, and mortality rates that may explain the regional differences.

Materials and methodsA multi-group ecological study was performed based on the information available from public databases. Notification of cases, hospitalization, and crude mortality and age-adjusted rates were calculated.

ResultsThe municipalities with the highest COVID-1 burden at different times during the study period displayed significant differences in population density and the proportion of elderly inhabitants, indigenous and afro descendants minorities; indices of unsatisfied basic needs and multidimensional poverty index, as well as the number of hospital beds. Likewise, essential variations in notification rates, hospitalization, and mortality were observed. The highest age-adjusted of reported cases (4,219 cases) and mortality (230.4 cases) rates were found in Leticia, the lowest general hospitalization rates in Buenaventura (37.5 cases) and the lowest ICU hospitalization rates (0) in Leticia and Tumaco due to a lack of these units in these municipalities.

311,"Using an Agent-Based Model to Assess K-12 School Re-openings Under Different COVID-19 Spread Scenarios - United States, School Year 2020/21","School-age children play a key role in the spread of airborne viruses like influenza due to the prolonged and close contacts they have in school settings. As a result, school closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions were recommended as the first line of defense in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Assessing school reopening scenarios is a priority for states, administrators, parents, and children in order to balance educational disparities and negative population impacts of COVID-19. To address this challenge, we used an agent-based model that simulates communities across the United States including daycares, primary, and secondary schools to quantify the relative health outcomes of reopening schools. We explored different reopening scenarios including remote learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student population into cohorts (also referred to as split cohort) in order to reduce exposure and disease spread. In addition, we assessed the combined impact of reduced in-person attendance in workplaces (e.g., through differing degrees of reliance on telework and/or temporary workplace closings) and school reopening scenarios to quantify the potential impact of additional transmission pathways contributing to COVID-19 spread. Scenarios where split cohorts of students return to school in non-overlapping formats resulted in significant decreases in the clinical attack rate (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic individuals), potentially by as much as 75%. These split cohort scenarios have impacts which are only modestly lesser than the most impactful 100% distance learning scenario. Split cohort scenarios can also significantly avert the number of cases-approximately 60M and 28M-depending on the scenario, at the national scale over the simulated eight-month period. We found the results of our simulations to be highly dependent on the number of workplaces assumed to be open for in-person business, as well as the initial level of COVID-19 incidence within the simulated community. Our results show that reducing the number of students attending school leads to better health outcomes, and the split cohort option enables part-time in-classroom education while substantially reducing risk. The results of this study can support decisions regarding optimal school reopening strategies that at the population level balance education and the negative health outcomes of COVID-19.

312,Mathematical Modeling of COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent,"The present work aims to give a contribution to the understanding of the highly infectious pandemic caused by the COVID-19 in the African continent. The study focuses on the modelling and the forecasting of COVID-19 spread in the most affected African continent, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and South Africa and for the sake of comparison two of the most affected European country are also considered, namely: France and Italy. To this end, an epidemiological SEIQRDP model is presented, which is an adaptation of the classic SIR model widely used in mathematical epidemiology. In order to better coincide with the preventive measures taken by the governments to deal with the spread of COVID-19, this model considers the quarantine. For the identification of the models parameters, official data of the pandemic up to August 1st, 2020 are considered. The results show that the number of infections due to the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided the isolation is effective. However, it is increasing in some countries with the early lifting of containment. Finally, the information provided by the SEIQRDP model could help to establish a realistic assessment of the short-term pandemic situation.

313,"Robust test and trace strategies can prevent COVID-19 resurgences: a case study from New South Wales, Australia","BackgroundThe early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. In this study, we examine the Australian state of New South Wales, a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage, and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. We investigate how vulnerable the state would be to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing, and mask usage.

MethodsWe use a stochastic agent-based model, calibrated to the New South Wales epidemic and policy environment, to simulate possible epidemic outcomes over October 1 - December 31, 2020, under a range of assumptions about contact tracing efficacy, testing rates, and mask uptake.

ResultsWe find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower (and vice versa). With very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case), we estimate that the epidemic would remain under control until at least the end of 2020, with as little as 70-110 new infections estimated over October 1 - December 31 under high mask uptake scenarios, or 340-1,400 without masks, depending on the efficacy of community contact tracing. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period would be up to 6 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 17 times higher if the testing rate was 65%, or more than 100 times higher with a 50% testing rate.

ConclusionsOur work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission in dynamic community settings. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling community-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Robyn M Stuart; Romesh G Abeysuriya; Cliff C Kerr; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Richard Gray; Margaret Hellard; Nick Scott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209429,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209429,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
314,The Characteristics of Health Care Workers with COVID-19 and Relationship Between COVID-19 Mortality and BCG/Tuberculosis History: a multi-center study,"BackgroundToday, COVID-19 pandemic has brought countries health services into sharp focus. Despite the low incidence of cases(1.2%) and high mortality rate(2.4%) among Turkish population, the low mortality rate(0.3%) despite the high incidence(11.5%) declared in healthcare workers drew our groups attention. Therefore, we aimed to report the characteristics of infected health-care workers and investigate the relationship between BCG vaccine and tuberculosis history with COVID-19 mortality in infected health-care worker population.

MethodThis study was conducted in three hospitals to assess the clinical presentations, disease severity and correlation with BCG vaccine and tuberculous history in COVID-19 positive health-care workers by an online questionnaire platform. The relationship between characteristics and tuberculosis history were investigated according to hospitalization status of the patients.

ResultTotal of 465 infected healthcare workers included in the study. The rate of history of direct care and contact to tuberculosis patient, presence of previous tuberculosis treatment and BCG scar, presence of radiological infiltrations was significantly higher in hospitalized healthcare workers. The ratio of direct care and direct contact to the patient with tuberculosis, and presence of family history of tuberculosis were statistically significantly higher in patients with radiological infiltrations.

ConclusionAlthough COVID-19 risk and incidence are higher among healthcare workers compared to the normal population due to higher virus load, this study brings evidence for the fact that the lower mortality rate seen in infected healthcare workers might be due to healthcare workers frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of BCG vaccine, despite the higher hospitalization rate and radiological infiltrations due to over-triggered immune system.",Serife Torun; Sevket OZKAYA; Nazan Sen; Fikret Kanat; Irem Karaman; Sebnem Yosunkaya; Ozlem Sengoren Dikis; Ali Asan; Selma Aydogan Eroglu; Sefa Semih Atal; Omer Ayten; Nimet Aksel; Hilal Ermis; Neslihan Ozcelik; Meryem Demirelli; Iskender Kara; Sua Sumer; Kamile Marakoglu; Fatih Uzer; Yasin Uyar; Tuba Cicek; Husamettin Vatansev; Berna Botan Yildirim; Tuba Kuruoglu; Aynur Atilla; Yasemin Ersoy; Bahar Kandemir; Yasemin Durduran; Fatma Goksin Cihan; Nur Demirbas; Fatma Yildirim; M Sule Akcay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209403,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209403,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

We found that anxiety and cognitive impairment are manifested by 28-56% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild or no respiratory symptoms and are associated with altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using an independent cohort, we found histopathological signs of brain damage in 19% of individuals who died of COVID-19. All of the affected brain tissues exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in astrocytes. Infection of neural stem cell-derived astrocytes changed energy metabolism, altered key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons and for biogenesis of neurotransmitters, and elicited a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability.

316,Group Testing with Homophily to Curb Epidemics with Asymptomatic Carriers,"Non-technical summaryThe global fight against COVID-19 is plagued by asymptomatic transmission and false negatives. Group testing is increasingly recognized as necessary to fight this epidemic. I examine the gains from considering heterogeneous interpersonal interactions (homophily), which induce potential contamination, when designing testing pools. Homophily can be identified ex ante at a scale commensurate with pool size, so that the risk of contamination is higher within a well-designed pool than with an outsider. This makes it possible to overcome the usual information-theoretic limits of group testing which rely on an implicit homogeneity assumption. More importantly, group testing with homophily detects asymptomatic carriers that would be missed even by exhaustive individual testing because of false negatives. Such a strategy should be implemented at least at a weekly frequency to fit the time profile of test positivity. It can be used either to avoid unnecessary lockdowns or to make lockdowns more efficient.",Louis-Marie Harpedanne de Belleville,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210260,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210260,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
317,Predicting mortality of individual COVID-19 patients: A multicenter Dutch cohort,"Objective: Develop and validate models that predict mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to the hospital. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: A multicenter cohort across ten Dutch hospitals including patients from February 27 to June 8 2020. Participants: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (age [&ge;] 18) admitted to the hospital. Main Outcome Measures: 21-day mortality evaluated by the area under the receiver operatory curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The predictive value of age was explored by comparison with age-based rules used in practice and by excluding age from analysis. Results: 2273 patients were included, of whom 516 had died or discharged to palliative care within 21 days after admission. Five feature sets, including premorbid, clinical presentation and laboratory & radiology values, were derived from 80 features. Additionally, an ANOVA-based data-driven feature selection selected the ten features with the highest F-values: age, number of home medications, urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, oxygen saturation (%), oxygen saturation is measured on room air, oxygen saturation is measured on oxygen therapy, blood gas pH and history of chronic cardiac disease. A linear logistic regression (LR) and non-linear tree-based gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm fitted the data with an AUC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.85) and 0.82 (0.79 to 0.85), respectively, using the ten selected features. Both models outperformed age-based decision rules used in practice (AUC of 0.69, 0.65 to 0.74 for age > 70). Furthermore, performance remained stable when excluding age as predictor (AUC of 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81) Conclusion: Both models showed excellent performance and had better test characteristics than age-based decision rules, using ten admission features readily available in Dutch hospitals.

318,Gargle-Direct: Extraction-Free Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) of Saline Gargle Rinse Samples,"BackgroundSaline mouth rinse/gargle samples have recently been shown to be a suitable option for swab-independent self-collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. We sought to evaluate a simplified process for direct reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of this novel sample type and to compare performance with routine RT-qPCR using automated nucleic acid extraction.

MethodsClinical saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were subjected to automated nucleic acid extraction (""standard method""), followed by RT-qPCR using three assays including the FDA authorized US-CDCs N1/N2 assay, which was the reference standard for determining sensitivity/specificity. For extraction-free workflow, an aliquot of each gargle sample underwent viral heat inactivation at 65 {degrees}C for 20 minutes followed by RT-qPCR testing, without an intermediate extraction step. An in-house validated RT-qPCR lab developed test (LDT), targeting the SARS-CoV-2s S/ORF8 genes (SORP triplex assay) and the N1/N2 US-CDC assay was used to evaluate the extraction-free protocol. To improve the analytical sensitivity, we developed a single-tube hemi-nested (STHN) version of the SORP triplex assay.

ResultsA total of 38 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 75 negative saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were included in this evaluation. A 100% concordance in detection rate was obtained between the standard method and the extraction-free approach for the SORP assay. An average increase of +2.63 to +5.74 of the cycle threshold (CT) values was observed for both the SORP and N1/N2 assay when extraction-free was compared between the standard method. The average {Delta}CT [{Delta}CT=CT(Direct PCR)-CT(Extracted RNA)], for each of the gene targets were: S ({Delta}CT= +4.24), ORF8 ({Delta}CT=+2.63), N1 ({Delta}CT=+2.74) and N2 ({Delta}CT=+5.74). The {Delta}CT for the STHN SORP assay was +1.51 and -2.05 for the S and ORF8 targets respectively, when extracted method was compared to the standard method.

ConclusionOur Gargle-Direct SARS-CoV-2 method is operationally simple, minimizes pre-analytical sample processing and is potentially implementable by most molecular diagnostic laboratories. The empirical demonstration of single-tube hemi-nested RT-qPCR, to specifically address and alleviate the widely-acknowledged problem of reduced analytical sensitivity of detection of extraction-free templates, should help diagnostic laboratories in choosing Gargle-Direct protocol for high-throughput testing.",Peter Tilley; Vijay Gadkar; David M Goldfarb; Virginia Young; Nicole Watson; Ghada N.

319,Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in recovered COVID-19 patients: studies based on cellular and structural biology analysis,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been reported in several virus infections including dengue fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. To study whether ADE is involved in COVID-19 infections, in vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into Raji cells, K562 cells, and primary B cells mediated by plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients were employed as models. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells was more commonly detected in plasma from severely-affected elderly patients with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. Cellular entry was mediated via the engagement of Fc{gamma}RII receptor through virus-cell membrane fusion, but not by endocytosis. Peptide array scanning analyses showed that antibodies which promote SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted the variable regions of the RBD domain. To further characterize the association between the spike-specific antibody and ADE, an RBD-specific monoclonal antibody (7F3) was isolated from a recovered patient, which potently inhibited SARS-Cov-2 infection of ACE-2 expressing cells and also mediated ADE in Raji cells. Site-directed mutagenesis the spike RBD domain reduced the neutralization activity of 7F3, but did not abolish its binding to the RBD domain. Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed that 7F3 binds to spike proteins at a shift-angled pattern with one ""up"" and two ""down"" RBDs, resulting in partial overlapping with the receptor binding motif (RBM), while a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that lacked ADE activity binds to spike proteins with three ""up"" RBDs, resulting in complete overlapping with RBM. Our results revealed that ADE mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies could result from binding to the receptor in slightly different pattern from antibodies mediating neutralizations. Studies on ADE using antibodies from recovered patients via cell biology and structural biology technology could be of use for developing novel therapeutic and preventive measures for control of COVID-19 infection.",Fan Wu; Renhong Yan; Mei Liu; Zezhong Liu; Yingdan Wang; Die Luan; Kaiyue Wu; Zhigang Song; Tingting Sun; Yunping Ma; Yuanyuan Zhang; Qimin Wang; Xiang Li; Ping Ji; Yaning Li; Cheng Li; Yanling Wu; Tianlei Ying; Yumei Wen; Shibo Jiang; Tongyu Zhu; Lu Lu; Yongzheng Zhang; Qiang Zhou; Jinghe Huang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209114,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209114,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

Genomic studies can be helpful in understanding the disease dynamics. We have downloaded 324 complete and near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted in GISAID database from Bangladesh which were isolated between 30 March to 7 September, 2020. We then compared these genomes with Wuhan reference sequence and found 4160 mutation events including 2253 missense single nucleotide variations, 38 deletions and 10 insertions. The C>T nucleotide change was most prevalent (41% of all muations) possibly due to selective mutation pressure to reduce CpG sites to evade CpG targeted host immune response. The most frequent mutation that occurred in 98% isolates was 3037C>T which is a synonymous change that almost always accompanied 3 other mutations that include 241C>T, 14408C>T (P323L in RdRp) and 23403A>G (D614G in spike protein). The P323L was reported to increase mutation rate and D614G is associated with increased viral replication and currently most prevalent variant circulating all over the world. We identified multiple missense mutations in B-cell and T-cell predicted epitope regions and/or PCR target regions (including R203K and G204R that occurred in 86% of the isolates) that may impact immunogenicity and/or RT-PCR based diagnosis. Our analysis revealed 5 large deletion events in ORF7a and ORF8 gene products that may be associated with less severity of the disease and increased viral clearance. Our phylogeny analysis identified most of the isolates belonged to the Nextstrain clade 20B (86%) and GISAID clade GR (88%). Most of our isolates shared common ancestors either directly with European countries or jointly with middle eastern countries as well as Australia and India. Interestingly, the 19B clade (GISAID S clade) was unique to Chittagong which was originally prevalent in China. This reveals possible multiple introduction of the virus in Bangladesh via different routes.

321,Structural basis for bivalent binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by human potent neutralizing antibodies,"Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent promising candidates for clinical intervention against coronavirus virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19). We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In order to understand the mechanism of these nAbs on neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, we have performed cryo-EM analysis and here report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG or Fab forms bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBD in the ""up"" conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and their correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.",Renhong Yan; Ruoke Wang; Bin Ju; Jinfang Yu; Yuanyuan Zhang; Nan Liu; Jia Wang; Qi Zhang; Peng Chen; Bing Zhou; Yaning Li; Shuyuan Zhang; Long Tian; Xinyue Zhong; Lin Cheng; Xiangyang Ge; Juanjuan Zhao; Hong-wei Wang; Xinquan Wang; Zheng Zhang; Linqi Zhang; Qiang Zhou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.336800,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.336800,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
322,Sequential infection with influenza A virus followed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to more severe disease and encephalitis in a mouse model of COVID-19.,"COVID-19 is a spectrum of clinical symptoms in humans caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has rapidly caused a pandemic. Coalescence of a second wave of this virus with seasonal respiratory viruses, particularly influenza virus is a possible global health concern. To investigate this, transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) were first infected with IAV followed by SARS-CoV-2. The host response and effect on virus biology was compared to K18-hACE2 mice infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 only. Infection of mice with each individual virus resulted in a disease phenotype compared to control mice. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis appeared significantly reduced in the sequentially infected mice, these mice had a more rapid weight loss, more severe lung damage and a prolongation of the innate response compared to singly infected or control mice. The sequential infection also exacerbated the extrapulmonary manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2. This included a more severe encephalitis. Taken together, the data suggest that the concept of  twinfection is deleterious and mitigation steps should be instituted as part of a comprehensive public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jordan  J.

323,Degradation of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 by tobacco carcinogen-induced Skp2 in lung epithelial cells,"An unexpected observation among the COVID-19 pandemic is that smokers constituted only 1.4-18.5% of hospitalized adults, calling for an urgent investigation to determine the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) increase ACE2 mRNA but trigger ACE2 protein catabolism. BaP induces an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp2 for ACE2 ubiquitination. ACE2 in lung tissues of non-smokers is higher than in smokers, consistent with the findings that tobacco carcinogens downregulate ACE2 in mice. Tobacco carcinogens inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudovirions infection of the cells. Given that tobacco smoke accounts for 8 million deaths including 2.1 million cancer deaths annually and Skp2 is an oncoprotein, tobacco use should not be recommended and cessation plan should be prepared for smokers in COVID-19 pandemic.",Guang-Biao Zhou; Gui-Zhen Wang; Qun Zhao; Fan Liang; Chen Zhang; Hui Zhang; Jun Wang; Zhen-Yin Chen; Ran Wu; Hong Yu; Bei-Bei Sun; Ruie Feng; Kai-Feng Xu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337774,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337774,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False

The G614 variant has now replaced the D614-carrying virus as the dominant circulating strain. We report here cryo-EM structures of a full-length S trimer carrying G614, which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations differing primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain (RBD). A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity. The loop transition may also modulate structural rearrangements of S protein required for membrane fusion.

325,"A 3D Structural Interactome to Explore the Impact of Evolutionary Divergence, Population Variation, and Small-molecule Drugs on SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interactions","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a global public health crisis. Vital to the development of informed treatments for this disease is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions involved in disease pathology. One lens through which we can better understand this pathology is through the network of protein-protein interactions between its viral agent, SARS-CoV-2, and its human host. For instance, increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV can be explained by rapid evolution along the interface between the Spike protein and its human receptor (ACE2) leading to increased binding affinity. Sequence divergences that modulate other protein-protein interactions may further explain differences in transmission and virulence in this novel coronavirus. To facilitate these comparisons, we combined homology-based structural modeling with the ECLAIR pipeline for interface prediction at residue resolution, and molecular docking with PyRosetta. This enabled us to compile a novel 3D structural interactome meta-analysis for the published interactome network between SARS-CoV-2 and human. This resource includes docked structures for all interactions with protein structures, enrichment analysis of variation along interfaces, predicted {Delta}{Delta}G between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants for each interaction, predicted impact of natural human population variation on binding affinity, and a further prioritized set of drug repurposing candidates predicted to overlap with protein interfaces{dagger}. All predictions are available online{dagger} for easy access and are continually updated when new interactions are published.

326,Pilot production of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins in plants: a proof of concept for rapid repurposing of indoors farms into biomanufacturing facilities,"The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the worlds capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were all engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.",Borja Diego-Martin; Beatriz González; Marta Vazquez-Vilar; Sara Selma; Rubén Mateos-Fernández; Silvia Gianoglio; Asun Fernández-del-Carmen; Diego Orzaez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.331306,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.331306,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False

328,"Sero-prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","BackgroundAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are being increasingly used for sero-epidemiological purposes to provide better understanding of the extent of the infection in the community, and monitoring the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. We conducted sero-prevalence study to estimate prior infection with with SARS-CoV-2 in Addis Ababa.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was done from April 23 to 28, 2020 among 301 randomly selected residents of Addis Ababa; with no known history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 person. Interviews on socio demographic and behavioural risk factor followed by serological tests were performed for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and IgG antibodies, using COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. The test has sensitivity of 87{middle dot}9% and specificity of 100% for lgM; and a sensitivity of 97{middle dot}2% and specificity of 100% for IgG. RT-PCR test was also done on combined nasopharyngeal and oropharengeal swabs as an important public health consideration.

FindingsThe unadjusted antibody-based crude SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 7{middle dot}6% and the adjusted true SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was estimated at 8{middle dot}8% (95% CI 5{middle dot}5%-11{middle dot}6%) for the study population. Higher sero-prevalence were observed for males (9.0%), age below 50 years (8.2%), students and unemployed (15.6%), those with primary education (12.1%), smokers (7.8%), alcohol consumers (8.6%), chatt-chewers (13.6%) and shish smokers (18.8%). Seroprevalence was not significantly associated neither with socio-demographic not behavioral characteristics. According to the findings, possibly more individuals had been infected in Addis Ababa than what was being detected and reported by RT-PCR test suggestive of community transmission. The use of serological test for epidemiological estimation of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic gives a more precise estimate of magnitude which would be used for further monitoring and surveillance of the magnitude of the SARS CoV-2 infection.",Berhanu Nega; Adamu Addissie; Gemechis Mamo; Negussie Deyessa; Tamrat Abebe; Abdulnasir Abagero; Wondimu Ayele; Workeabeba Abebe; Tewodros Haile; Rahel Argaw; Wondwossen Amogne; Ayele Belachew; Zelalem Desalegn; Brhanu Teka; Eva Kantelhardt; Mesfin Wossen; Saro Abdella; Getachew Tollera; Lia Tadesse,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337287,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337287,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
329,"Elevated antiviral, myeloid and endothelial inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19","The mechanisms that underpin COVID-19 disease severity, and determine the outcome of infection, are only beginning to be unraveled. The host inflammatory response contributes to lung injury, but circulating mediators levels fall below those in classical cytokine storms. We analyzed serial plasma samples from 619 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC clinical characterization protocol U.K. study and 39 milder community cases not requiring hospitalization. Elevated levels of numerous mediators including angiopoietin-2, CXCL10, and GM-CSF were seen at recruitment in patients who later died. Markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2 and von-Willebrand factor A2) were detected early in some patients, while inflammatory cytokines and markers of lung injury persisted for several weeks in fatal COVID-19 despite decreasing antiviral cytokine levels. Overall, markers of myeloid or endothelial cell activation were associated with severe, progressive, and fatal disease indicating a central role for innate immune activation and vascular inflammation in COVID-19.",Ryan Thwaites; Ashley Sanchez Sevilla Uruchurtu; Matthew Siggins; Felicity Liew; Clark D Russell; Shona Moore; Edwin Carter; Simon Abrams; Charlotte-Eve Short; Thilipan Thaventhiran; Emma Bergstrom; Zoe Gardener; Stephanie Ascough; Christopher Chiu; Annemarie B Docherty; David Hunt; Yanick Crow; Tom Solomon; Graham Taylor; Lance Turtle; Ewen M Harrison; Malcolm Gracie Semple; J Kenneth Baillie; Peter JM Openshaw,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209411,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
330,Estimating the impact of disruptions due to COVID-19 on HIV transmission and control among men who have sex with men in China,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic is impacting HIV care globally, with gaps in HIV treatment expected to increase HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality. We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China.

MethodsRegional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%). A deterministic mathematical model of HIV transmission and treatment among MSM in China was used to estimate the impact of these disruptions on the number of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over 1 and 5 years for a 3-, 4- or 6-month disruption period.

ResultsOur China model predicted that new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions for a 3-month period increasing HIV infections by 5-14% over 1 year and deaths by 7-12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5-14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11-23% fewer infections and 0.4-1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods of 4 and 6 months amplified the impact of combined disruption scenarios. When all realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections was always predicted over one year (3-17%), but not over 5 years (1% increase-4% decrease), while deaths mostly increased over one year (1-2%) and 5 years (1.2 increase - 0.3 decrease).

ConclusionsThe overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19 related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.",Ross D Booton; Gengfeng Fu; Louis MacGregor; Jianjun Li; Jason J Ong; Joseph D Tucker; Katy ME Turner; Weiming Tang; Peter Vickerman; Kate Mitchell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209072,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209072,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
331,Characteristics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections among ambulatory and hospitalized children and adolescents in an integrated health care system in Tennessee,"BackgroundLittle is known regarding the full spectrum of illness among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection across ambulatory and inpatient settings.

MethodsActive surveillance was performed for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a quaternary care academic hospital laboratory in Tennessee from March 12-July 17, 2020. For symptomatic patients [&le;]18 years of age, we performed phone follow-up and medical record review to obtain sociodemographic and clinical data on days 2, 7, and 30 after diagnosis and on day 30 for asymptomatic patients [&le;]18 years. Daily and 7-day average test positivity frequencies were calculated for children and adults beginning April 26, 2020.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 was detected in 531/10327 (5.1%) specimens from patients [&le;]18 years, including 46/5752 (0.8%) asymptomatic and 485/4575 (10.6%) specimens from 459 unique symptomatic children. Cough (51%), fever (42%), and headache (41%) were the most common symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization was uncommon (18/459 children; 4%); no children with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period required intensive care unit admission. Symptom resolution occurred by follow-up day 2 in 192/459 (42%), by day 7 in 332/459 (72%), and by day 30 in 373/396 (94%). The number of cases and percent positivity rose in late June and July in all ages.

ConclusionsIn an integrated healthcare network, most pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were mild, brief, and rarely required hospital admission, despite increasing cases as community response measures were relaxed.

332,A rapid and cost-effective multiplex ARMS-PCR method for the simultaneous genotyping of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clades,"Tracing the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants is essential for the outbreak alerts and far-reaching epidemiological surveillance. The available technique to identify the phylogenetic clades through high-throughput sequencing is costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive that hinders the viral genotyping in low-income countries. Here, we propose a rapid, simple and cost-effective amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-based multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR assay to identify six distinct phylogenetic clades: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR. This approach is applied on 24 COVID-19 positive samples as confirmed by CDC approved real-time PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. Our multiplex PCR is designed in a mutually exclusive way to identify V-S and G-GH-GR clade variants separately. The pentaplex assay included all five variants and the quadruplex comprised of the triplex variants alongside either V or S clade mutations that created two separate subsets. The procedure was optimized in the primer concentration (0.2-0.6 {micro}M) and annealing temperature (56-60{degrees}C) of PCR using 3-5 ng/{micro}l cDNA template synthesized upon random- and oligo(dT)-primer based reverse transcription. The different primer concentration for the triplex and quadruplex adjusted to different strengths ensured an even amplification with a maximum resolution of all targeted amplicons. The targeted Sanger sequencing further confirmed the presence of the clade-featured mutations with another set of our designed primers. This multiplex ARMS-PCR assay is sample, cost-effective, and convenient that can successfully discriminate the circulating phylogenetic clades of SARS-CoV-2.",Md. Tanvir Islam; A. S. M.

333,Estimating the effect of social inequalities in the mitigation of COVID-19 across communities in Santiago de Chile,"We study the spatio-temporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Santiago de Chile using anonymized mobile phone data from 1.4 million users, 22% of the whole population in the area, characterizing the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the epidemic dynamics. We integrate these data into a mechanistic epidemic model calibrated on surveillance data. As of August 1st 2020, we estimate a detection rate of 102 cases per 1,000 infections (90% CI: [95 - 112 per 1,000]). We show that the introduction of a full lockdown on May 15th, 2020, while causing a modest additional decrease in mobility and contacts with respect to previous NPIs, was decisive in bringing the epidemic under control, highlighting the importance of a timely governmental response to COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that the impact of NPIs on individuals mobility correlates with the Human Development Index of comunas in the city. Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic.

334,Estimating the Burden of COVID-19 Symptoms Among Participants at the 2020 USA Curling Club Nationals Tournament,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with evidence suggesting that activities involving heavier breathing, such as singing and exercise, can result in increased risk for disease transmission. The USA Curling Club Nationals is a week-long curling tournament to determine the mens and womens club-level champions. The 2020 tournament took place March 7-14 at the Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, MD, and featured teams from across the United States. Preventative measures, such as increased cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, single use and disposable food containers, and canceling traditional event banquets were implemented. Despite these measures, players, coaches, officials, volunteers, and spectators contracted the virus as a result of participation in the event. We surveyed participants to assess total positivity, potential days of transmission, and the burden of symptoms experienced among the participants. We found that 55.6% of all participants reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with nearly all experiencing more than one symptom. Although most participants symptoms resolved quickly, 9.6% of all participants experienced symptoms for at least one month and 12.6% of all participants reported taking at least 30 days before they felt they had returned to normal. As a result of this study, we believe curling tournaments have the potential to be high-risk events for the transmission of COVID-19.

State-specific aCFRs were estimated, using 13-day lag for fatality. To estimate country-level aCFR, state estimates were meta-analysed. Multiple correspondence analyses (MCA), followed by univariable logistic regression, were conducted to understand the association between aCFR and geodemographic, health and social indicators. Based on health indicators, states likely to report a higher aCFR were identified. Using random- and fixed-effects models, the aCFRs in India were 1.42 (95% CI 1.19 - 1.70) and 2.97 (95% CI 2.94 - 3.00), respectively. The aCFR was grouped with the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and acute respiratory infections in the first and second dimensions of MCA. The current study demonstrated the value of using meta-analysis to estimate aCFR.

336,COVID-19 serological survey using micro blood sampling,"During August 2020, we carried out a serological survey among students and employees at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), Japan, testing for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We used a FDA-authorized 2-step ELISA protocol developed by the Krammer Lab (1, 2) in combination with at-home self-collection of blood samples using a custom low-cost finger prick-based capillary blood collection kit. Although our survey did not find any COVID-19 seropositive individuals among the OIST cohort, it reliably detected all positive control samples obtained from a local hospital and excluded all negatives controls. Among our controls, we found strong cross-reactivity of antibodies in samples from a serum pool from two MERS patients in the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S ELISA. Here we show that a centralized ELISA in combination with patient-based capillary blood collection using as little as one drop of blood can reliably assess the seroprevalence among communities. Anonymous sample tracking and an integrated website created a stream-lined procedure. Major parts of the workflow were automated on a liquid handler, demonstrating scalability.

337,Examining Unit Costs for COVID-19 Case Management in Kenya,"IntroductionCase management for COVID-19 patients is one of key interventions in country responses to the pandemic. Countries need information on the costs of case management to inform resource mobilization, planning and budgeting, purchasing arrangements, and assessments of the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We estimated unit costs for COVID-19 case management for patients with asymptomatic, mild to moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 disease in Kenya.

MethodsWe estimated per patient per day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients that are asymptomatic and those that have mild to moderate, severe, and critical symptoms. For asymptomatic and mild to moderate patients, we estimated unit costs for home-based care and institutional (hospitals and isolation centers). We used an ingredients approach, adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from COVID-19 case management guidelines, home based care guidelines, and human resource guidelines, and augmented this with data provided by three public covid-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya. We obtained input prices for services from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and for pharmaceuticals, non-pharmaceuticals, devices and equipment from market price databases for Kenya.

ResultsPer day per patient unit cost for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease under home based care are KES 1,993.01 (USD 18.89) and 1995.17 (USD 18.991) respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation center of hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate disease are 7,415.28 (USD 70.29) and 7,417.44 (USD 70.31) respectively. Per day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19 disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in intensive care units are 12,570.75 (USD 119.16) and 59,369.42 (USD 562.79).

ConclusionCOVID-19 case management costs are substantial. Unit costs for asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID-19 patients in home-based care is 4-fold lower compared institutional care of the same patients. Kenya will not only need to mobilize substantial resources to finance COVID-19 case management but also explore additional service delivery adaptations that will reduce unit costs.",Edwine Barasa; Angela Kairu; Wangari Nganga; Marybeth Maritim; Vincent Were; Samuel Akech; Mercy Mwangangi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209684,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209684,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
338,Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis and HIV services: a cross-sectional survey of 669 health professionals in 64 low and middle-income countries,"ObjectiveThe experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between May 12 and August 6 2020, we collected qualitative and quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse responses.

Findings669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since COVID-19. The most common barriers reported to affect patients were: fear of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28% of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also severely impacted. Strategies to address reduced transport needs and costs - including proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate lower cost or easier travel - were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted according to 36% and 31% of HIV and TB respondents respectively; qualitative data suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated.

ConclusionPatients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in accessing healthcare facilities, and non-medical support for patients was particularly impacted.

339,Evaluation of saliva sampling procedures for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics reveals differential sensitivity and association with viral load,"Nasopharyngeal sampling has been the preferential collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a healthcare professional would be more preferable for patients and health professionals. Saliva collection has been proposed as such a possible alternative sampling procedure. We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices (spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral load, sensitivity increased substantially (97.0% and 76.7% for spitting and swabbing, respectively), irrespective of symptomatic status. Our results suggest that saliva cannot readily replace nasopharyngeal sampling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics but may enable identification of cases with medium to high viral loads.",Pieter Mestdagh; Michel Gillard; Marc Arbyn; Jean-Paul Pirnay; Jeroen Poels; Jan Hellemans; Eliana Peeters; Veronik Hutse; Celine Vermeiren; Maxime Boutier; Veerle De Wever; Patrick Soentjens; Sarah Djebara; Hugues Malonne; Emmanuel Andre; John Smeraglia; Jo Vandesompele,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207902,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207902,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of 405 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Kuwait. Outcomes such as symptoms severity and mortality were considered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to report the odds ratios (OR) for ICU admission and dying from COVID-19.

ResultsThe cohort included 290 Arabs and 115 South Asians. South Asians recorded significantly higher COVID-19 death rates compared to Arabs (33% vs. 7.6%, P value<0.001). When compared to Arabs, South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 3.34 - 11.80, p < 0.001). South Asian patients showed 7.62 (95% CI: 3.62 - 16.02, p < 0.001) times the odds of dying from COVID-19.

We used internal-external cross-validation to show consistent measures of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility across eight geographical regions. We further validated the final model in held-out data from 8,252 individuals in London, with similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0.77 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.78); calibration-in-the-large 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.06); calibration slope 0.96 (0.90 to 1.02)).

However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2.

344,"The risk for a new COVID-19 wave -- and how it depends on $R_0$, the current immunity level and current restrictions","The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: some regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The current immunity level i in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0, i and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures pMin needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level i plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different R0 and i it is shown that regions with lower R0 and low i may now need higher preventive measures (pMin) compared with other regions having higher R0 but also higher i, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.",Tom Britton; Pieter Trapman; Frank G Ball,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209981,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209981,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
345,Determinants of Developing Symptomatic Disease in Ethiopian COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundStudies show that having some symptoms seems to be associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The aim of the study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a randomly selected 765 COVID-19 patients (372 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients). Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls (asymptomatic), where p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsThe result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR= 1.818, 95% CI= 1.210, 2.731, p-value=0.004 for 30-39 years; AOR= 1.611, 95% CI= 1.016, 2.554, p-value=0.043 for 40-49 years and AOR= 4.076, 95% CI= 2.582, 6.435, p-value=0.0001 for years and above), sex (AOR= 1.672, 95% CI= 1.216, 2.299, p-value=0.002) and history of diabetes mellitus (AOR= 2.406, 95% CI= 1.384, 4.181, p-value=0.002) were found to be significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsDeveloping a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be determined by exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic.

Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to fully converge the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all the days), a 40-67% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among randomly selected 686 patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe), where p-value of <0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant difference. A Multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a significant association between the independent variables and COVID-19 disease severity where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsHaving moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with having hypertension (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR= 6.115, 95% CI= 2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-value=0.003). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated with age group (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR=18.070, 95% CI=9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), sex (AOR=1.842, 95% CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016), hypertension (AOR= 1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-value=0.028), diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964, 7.847, p-value=0.0001), fever (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 4.816, 95% CI= 2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001). In addition, determinants of severe disease as compared with moderate disease were found to be age group (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), fever (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI= 1.286, 3.634, p-value=0.004) and headache (AOR= 1.787, 95% CI= 1.028, 3.107, p-value=0.039).

ConclusionsBeing old, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and having symptoms of fever and headache were found to be determinants of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease category. We recommend a better preventive practice to be set in place so that these groups of patients can be protected from acquiring the disease.

To describe the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in each country or region, mathematical models were formulated aiming the estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The simplest mathematical model, the SIR model, provided a lower estimation for R0, ranging from 1.5 to 3.0. However, more elaborate models, taking into account the natural history of covid-19, must be used to obtain a more reliable estimation of R0. One of the elaborated models presented here estimated a higher value for R0, that is, 6.54 and 5.88 for, respectively, Sao Paulo State (Brazil) and Spain. It is worth stressing that this model assumed that severe covid-19 cases were not participating in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain, which can not be assumed in the SIR model.",Hyun Mo Yang; Luis Pedro Lombardi Junior; Ariana Campos Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210831,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210831,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
350,Estimating epidemiologic dynamics from single cross-sectional viral load distributions,"Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemics trajectory, subverting the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data should be regularly reported to public health officials by testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.",James A Hay; Lee Kennedy-Shaffer; Sanjat Kanjilal; Marc Lipsitch; Michael J Mina,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204222,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204222,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity.

Author SummarySince it arose in late 2019, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) behind the COVID-19 pandemic has mutated and evolved during its global spread. Individual patients may host different versions, or variants, of the virus, hallmarked by different mutations. We examine the diversity of genetic variants coexisting within patients across a cohort of 3939 publicly accessible samples and 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We find that a small number of patients carry most of the diversity, and that patients with more diversity tend to be older. We also find that most of the diversity is concentrated in certain regions and positions of the virus genome. In particular, we find that a variant reported to increase infectivity is among the most diverse positions. Our study provides a large-scale survey of within-patient diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",Jack Kuipers; Aashil  A Batavia; Kim Philipp Jablonski; Fritz Bayer; Nico Borgsmüller; Arthur Dondi; Monica-Andreea Drăgan; Pedro Ferreira; Katharina Jahn; Lisa Lamberti; Martin Pirkl; Susana Posada-Céspedes; Ivan Topolsky; Ina Nissen; Natascha Santacroce; Elodie Burcklen; Tobias Schär; Vincenzo Capece; Christiane Beckmann; Olivier Kobel; Christoph Noppen; Maurice Redondo; Sarah Nadeau; Sophie Seidel; Noemi Santamaria de Souza; Christian Beisel; Tanja Stadler; Niko Beerenwinkel,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335919,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335919,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
352,Determinants of Time to Convalescence among COVID-19 Patients at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia: A prospective cohort study,"AimTo estimate time to recovery/convalescence and identify determinants among COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance.

ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 32.4 years ({+/-} 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040).

ConclusionsPresence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.

Key MessagesO_LIThe study assessed the time to RT-PCR proven recovery (two consecutive negative viral shedding) and identified determinants that affected the time.
C_LIO_LISymptomatic infection is associated with delayed viral clearance.
C_LIO_LIThe finding of the study could be used to guide the isolation and treatment practice.

Nasal-oropharyngeal swabs were more sensitive than this salivary sample type (oral crevicular fluid) suggesting that not all saliva sample types have equivalent sensitivity.

355,Safely Reopening K-12 Schools During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Early school closures were a consistent, nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March due to the role that children play in spreading influenza. This left us with limited understanding of COVID-19 transmission in children until several states reopened schools for the 2020-2021 school year. While early school closures were likely beneficial in protecting children in the initial stages of the pandemic in the U.S., long-term closures pose significant cumulative effects in children who rely on schools for instruction and additional social services, and for parents who need to balance work and childcare obligations. Reopening schools safely is a high priority for many interested stakeholders.

Proposed in-person school reopening plans include traditional, 100% school capacity, five days per week instruction, hybrid scenarios with reduced in-person instruction and virtual learning, and various reduced school capacity schedules with non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. To assess the potential impacts of different reopening plans, we created a modified SIR-type transmission model that captures multiple known pathways of COVID-19 transmission in a 100,000-person community.

Our results show that plans that utilize consecutive days in school and divide students into separated smaller cohorts who attend school together, as well as plans that emphasize distance learning, are better able to suppress disease spread and reduce risk from an introduced infective into the community. Plans with more consecutive school days are protective for both the schoolchildren and surrounding community by acting to separate the larger intermixing population into smaller intermixing subpopulations. The ""Five-Day Switch"" plan, which separates students into two cohorts, each of whom attend in-person learning for five consecutive days followed by five days of distance learning, best captures these protective attributes. All modeled plans assumed initially disease-free communities and that childrens interactions with the community are greatly reduced during instructional days, both for in-person and distance learning.",Courtney D Shelley; Philippa S Chadwick; Carrie Manore; Sara Y Del Valle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208710,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208710,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
356,An Innovative Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention to Mitigate SARS-CoV02 Spread: Probability Sampling to Identify and Isolate Asymptomatic Cases,"Studies estimate that a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs through individuals who do not exhibit symptoms. Mitigation strategies test only those who are moderately to severely symptomatic, excluding the substantial portion of cases that are asymptomatic yet still infectious and likely responsible for a large proportion of the virus spread (1-8). While isolating asymptomatic cases will be necessary to effectively control viral spread, these cases are functionally invisible and there is no current method to identify them for isolation. To address this major omission in COVID-19 control, we develop a strategy, Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), for identifying and isolating individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the epidemic. STQ uses probability sampling in the general population, regardless of symptoms, then isolates the individuals who test positive along with their household members who are high probability for asymptomatic infections. To test the potential efficacy of STQ, we use an agent-based model, designed to computationally simulate the epidemic in the Seattle with infection parameters, like R0 and asymptomatic fraction, derived from population data. Our results suggest that STQ can substantially slow and decrease the spread of COVID-19, even in the absence of school and work shutdowns. Results also recommend which sampling techniques, frequency of implementation, and population subject to isolation are most efficient in reducing spread with limited numbers of tests.

Significance StatementA substantial portion of SARS-CoV-2 infections are spread through asymptomatic carriers. Until a vaccine is developed, research indicates an urgent need to identify these asymptomatic infections to control COVID-19, but there is currently no effective strategy to do so. In this study, we develop such a strategy, a procedure called Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), that combines techniques from survey methods for sampling from the general population and testing and isolation techniques from epidemiology. With computational simulations, we demonstrate that STQ procedures can dramatically decrease and slow COVID-19 spread, even in the absence of widespread work, school, and community lockdowns. We also find particular implementation strategies (including sampling techniques, frequencies of implementation, and people who are subject to isolation) are most efficient in mitigating spread.",Nathalie E Williams; Xiaozheng Yao; Ankita Pall; Xiaolu Qian; Mansi Rathod; Chang Xu; Adrian Dobra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208686,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208686,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
357,Forecasting COVID-19 cases in the Philippines using various mathematical models,"Due to the rapid increase of COVID-19 infection cases in many countries such as the Philippines, many efforts in forecasting the daily infections have been made in order to better manage the pandemic, and respond effectively. In this study, we consider the cumulative COVID-19 infection cases in the Philippines from March 6 to July 31,2020 and forecast the cases from August 1 - 15, 2020 using various mathematical models --weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, and random forest. We then compare the results to the actual data using traditional error metrics. Our results show that the ARIMA(1,2,1) model has the closest forecast values to the actual data. Policymakers can use our result in determining which forecast method to use for their community in order to have a data-based information for the preparation of their personnel and facilities.",Monica C Torres; Christian Alvin H Buhat; Ben Paul C Dela Cruz; Edd Francis O.

358,Using test positivity and reported case rates to estimate state-level COVID-19 prevalence in the United States,"Accurate estimates of the prevalence of infection are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (US), but reliable, timely prevalence data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates may provide strongly biased estimates. A single parameter semi-empirical model was developed, calibrated, and validated with prevalence predictions from two independent data-driven mathematical epidemiological models, each of which was separately validated using available cumulative infection estimates from recent state-wide serological testing in 6 states. The analysis shows that individually, reported case rates and test positivity rates may provide substantially biased estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission trends in the U.S. However, the COVID-19 prevalence for U.S. states from March-July, 2020 is well approximated, with a 7-day lag, by the geometric mean of reported case and test positivity rates averaged over the previous 14 days. Predictions of this semi-empirical model are at least 10-fold more accurate than either test positivity or reported case rates alone, with accuracy that remains relatively constant across different US states and varying testing rates. The use of this simple and readily-available surrogate metric for COVID-19 prevalence, that is more accurate than test positivity and reported case rates and does not rely on mathematical modeling, may provide more reliable information for decision makers to make effective state-level decisions as to public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the US.",Weihsueh chiu; Martial L Ndeffo-Mbah,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208504,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208504,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
359,Evaluating the impact of curfews and other measures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in French Guiana,"While general lockdowns have proven effective to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, they come with enormous costs for society. It is therefore essential to identify control strategies with lower social and economic impact. Here, we report and evaluate the control strategy implemented during a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in June-July 2020 in French Guiana that relied on curfews, targeted lockdowns and other measures. We find that the combination of these interventions reduced the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from 1.7 to 1.1, which was sufficient to avoid saturation of hospitals. We estimate that thanks to the young demographics across the territory, the risk of hospitalisation following infection was 0.3 times that of metropolitan France and that about 20% of the population was infected by July. Our model projections are consistent with a recent seroprevalence study. The study showcases how mathematical modeling can be used to support healthcare planning and decision making in a context of high uncertainty.",Alessio Andronico; Cecile Tran Kiem; Juliette Paireau; Tiphanie Succo; Paolo Bosetti; Noemie Lefrancq; Mathieu Nacher; Felix Djossou; Alice Sanna; Claude Flamand; Henrik Salje; Cyril Rousseau; Simon Cauchemez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208314,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208314,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
360,SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells correlate with neutralizing antibodies and increase during convalescence.,"T-cell immunity is likely to play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 by helping generate neutralizing antibodies. We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 21 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mount at least one CD4 T-cell response, and 48% of individuals mount detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh, defined as CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that M and N protein-specific pTfh may also assist in the development of neutralizing antibodies and that pTfh response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Author SummarySince December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most currently licensed vaccines are understood to protect against infection by inducing neutralizing antibodies. As such, ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials have focused on antibody neutralization as a primary immunologic endpoint. It is well established that T follicular helper cells are essential to the development of neutralizing antibodies and that a subset of these cells, peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh), can be studied in the blood. However, little is known about Tfh responses mounted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we studied pTfh to three major structural proteins in individuals recovered from COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh frequencies correlate with neutralizing antibody responses, especially those directed against the spike protein. We also find that pTfh responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase over time. Our findings suggest that pTfh responses against proteins other than the spike protein may contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies and suggests that formation of pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be delayed.",Sushma Boppana; Kai Qin; Jacob K Files; Ronnie M.

361,Understanding the phase separation characteristics of nucleocapsid protein provides a new therapeutic opportunity against SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",Dan Zhao; Weifan Xu; Xiaofan Zhang; Xiaoting Wang; Enming Yuan; Yuanpeng Xiong; Shenyang Wu; Shuya Li; Nian Wu; Tingzhong Tian; Xiaolong Feng; Hantao Shu; Peng Lang; Xiaokun Shen; Haitao Li; Pilong Li; Jianyang Zeng,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332734,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332734,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
362,The effect of salt on the dynamics of CoV-2 RBD at ACE2,"In this article, we investigate the effect of electrolytes on the stability of the complex between the coronavirus type 2 spike protein receptor domain (CoV-2 RBD) and ACE2, which plays an important role in the activation cascade at the viral entry of CoV-2 into human cells. At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. Additionally, the binding interface of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is highly hydrophilic. We simulated the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex at varying salt concentrations over the concentration range from 0.03 M to 0.3 M of calcium and sodium chloride over an individual simulation length of 750 ns in 9 independent simulations (6.75 {micro}s total). We observe that the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is stabilized independent of the salt concentration. We identify a strong negative electrostatic potential at the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD and we find that CoV-2 RBD binds even stronger at higher salt concentrations. We observe that the dynamics of the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD stabilize the protein complex leading to strong collective motions and a stable interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. We state that the sequence of CoV-2 RBD might be optimized for a strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations at the cellular surface, which acts as a key component in the activation of CoV-2 for its viral entry.

SIGNIFICANCEA novel coronavirus, coronavirus type 2 (CoV-2), was identified as primary cause for a worldwide pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV-2). The CoV-2 spike protein is a major target for the development of a vaccine and potential strategies to inhibit the viral entry into human cells. At the cellular surface, CoV-2 activation involves the direct interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD. At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. We thus investigate the effect of ion conditions on the interaction of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex and find stabilizing effects. We speculate that CoV-2 RBD is optimized for strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations.",Emanuel Peter; Alexander Schug,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333948,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333948,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
363,"Estimated Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Among Adults in Orange County, California","BackgroundClinic-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 may considerably underestimate the total number of infections. Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million).

MethodsWe implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered a SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n=2,979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests.

FindingsParticipants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5% to 12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR]= 1.47, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.78) and household income <$50,000 (vs. >$100,000: PR= 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79).

InterpretationResults from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of [~]12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics. In this region, SARS-CoV-2 also disproportionately affects Hispanic and low-income adults.

365,One size fits all?: Modeling face-mask fit on population-based faces,"The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has to date, not been examined and quantified. Here, we study the leakage of a rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects with diverse facial features, using computational mechanics modeling. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the leakage is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended mask size was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. Thin, feminine, and young faces benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. The results show that side-edge tuck-in of the masks could lead to a larger localized gap opening in many face categories, and is therefore not recommended for all. The perimeter leakage from the face mask worn by thin/feminine faces is mostly from the leakage area along the bottom edge of the mask and therefore, a tuck-in of the bottom edge of the mask or a mask smaller than the CDC recommended mask size are proposed as a more effective design. The leakage from the top edge of the mask is determined to be largely unaffected by mask size and tuck-in ratio, meaning that other mechanical alterations such as a nose wire strip are necessary to reduce the leakage at this site.",Tomas Solano; Rajat Mittal; Kourosh Shoele,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208744,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208744,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
366,Level of Knowledge in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Canadian Medical Students,"BackgroundDuring health crises medical education is often derailed as was the case during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical trainees face the daunting task of having to gather, filter and synthesize new information about the evolving situation often without the standardized resources they are used to.

MethodsWe surveyed Canadian medical students, in the hardest hit province of Quebec, on how they were acquiring knowledge as well as what they knew of the pandemic. Google Forms was used, with the survey being distributed to each medical school in Quebec (McGill, ULaval, Udem) both through email and through social media pages for each class year. Two analyses, Mann-Whitney and ANOVA tests, were performed for year of study and degree obtained.

ResultsWe received responses from 111 medical students from three universities, which represents 5% of the students invited to complete the survey. Students reported using mass media most frequently (83%) and also had a high rate of use of social media (to gather information about the pandemic. They rated these resources low in terms of their trustworthiness despite the high rates of use (average 2.91 and 2.03 of 5 respectively). Medical students also endorsed using more formal resources like public health information, scientific journals and faculty-provided information that they trusted more, however, they accessed these resources at lower rates. Of note, medical students had correct answered 60% of COVID-19 prevention strategies, 73% clinical correct answers, 90% epidemiological correct answers.

367,Prevalence of COVID-19-related risk factors and risk of severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors: a matched cohort study using linked English electronic health records data,"BackgroundPeople with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk. We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses.

MethodsWe included survivors ([&ge;]1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from UK primary care data linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for baseline demographics and comorbidities.

Findings108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer survivors had more asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, diabetes, neurological, renal, and liver disease, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR 2.22, 1.31-3.74).

InterpretationRisks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer survivors.

FundingWellcome Trust, Royal Society, NIHR.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSFew data are available to date on how COVID-19 affects cancer survivors. We searched PubMed with the keywords ""influenza cancer survivors"" to identify studies that compared severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors and in a control group. No study was identified.

Added value of this studyIn this matched cohort study of routinely collected electronic health records, we demonstrated raised risks of influenza hospitalisation or mortality in survivors from haematological malignancies for >10 years after diagnosis, and in survivors from solid cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis.

Implications of all the available evidenceCancer survivorship appears to be an important risk factor for severe influenza outcomes, suggesting that cancer survivors may also be at raised risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes. This should be taken into account in public health policies targeted at protecting clinical risk groups. Influenza vaccination should be encouraged in this group, and may need to be extended to a wider population of medium- to long-term cancer survivors than currently recommended.",Helena Carreira; Helen Strongman; Maria Peppa; Helen I McDonald; Isabel dos-Santos-Silva; Susannah Stanway; Liam Smeeth; Krishnan Bhaskaran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209304,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209304,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
368,"COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity Risks in a Survey of Over 500,000 People","The growing toll of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency of identifying individuals most at risk of infection and severe outcomes, underscoring the need to assess susceptibility and severity patterns in large datasets.1 The AncestryDNA COVID-19 Study collected self-reported survey data on symptoms, outcomes, risk factors, and exposures for over 563,000 adult individuals in the U.S., including over 4,700 COVID-19 cases as measured by a self-reported positive nasal swab test. We observed significant associations between several risk factors and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity outcomes. Many of the susceptibility associations were accounted for by differences in known exposures; a notable exception was elevated susceptibility odds for males after adjusting for known exposures and age. We also leveraged the dataset to build risk models to robustly predict individualized COVID-19 susceptibility (area under the curve [AUC]=0.84) and severity outcomes including hospitalization and life-threatening critical illness amongst COVID-19 cases (AUC=0.87 and 0.90, respectively).

369,Physical health complaints among healthcare workers engaged in the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients: A single tertiary-care center prospective study from Japan,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) who care for patients with the novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) are at an increased risk and fear contracting the infection themselves. HCWs are chronically exposed to very intense stress, both and physically and mentally. Hospitals must reduce both the physical and mental burden of HCWs on the front lines and ensure their safety. No prospective study has focused on the physical health complaints among HCWs engaged in the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate the occupational risk among HCWs of experiencing physical symptoms during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA twice-weekly questionnaire targeting HCWs who care for COVID-19 patients was performed at Osaka City University Hospital from April 30 to May 31, 2020 using a shareable Research Electronic Data Capture tool. The demographic characteristics of the participants, frequency of exposure to at-risk care, and physical complaints were evaluated.

ResultsA total of 35 doctors, 88 nurses, and 35 technicians were engaged in the care of these critically ill COVID-19 patients. 76 HCWs participated in this study, of whom 24 (31.6%) were doctors, 43 (56.6%) were nurses, and 9 (11.8%) were technicians. The frequency of experiencing any physical symptom was 25.0% among HCWs. Exposure to at-risk care was significantly higher among nurses than among doctors (p < 0.001); likewise, the frequency of experiencing physical symptoms was higher among nurses than among doctors (p < 0.01). The multivariate analysis revealed that nurses (odds ratio 8.29; p = 0.01) might be independently at risk of experiencing physical symptoms.

In severe COVID-19 cases, higher antibody titers against seasonal coronaviruses have been observed than in mild cases. To investigate antibody cross-reactivity as potential explanation for severe disease, we determined the kinetics, breadth, magnitude and level of cross-reactivity of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal CoV nucleocapsid and spike from 17 severe COVID-19 cases at the clonal level. Although patients mounted a mostly type-specific SARS-CoV-2 response, B-cell clones directed against seasonal CoV dominated and strongly increased over time. Seasonal CoV IgG responses that did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 were boosted well beyond detectable cross-reactivity, particularly for HCoV-OC43 spike. These findings support a back-boost of poorly protective coronavirus-specific antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients that may negatively impact de novo SARS-CoV-2 immunity, reminiscent of original antigenic sin.",Brenda M.

371,Machine learning based prognostic model and mobile application software platform for predicting infection susceptibility of COVID-19 using health care data,"From public health perspectives of COVID-19 pandemic, accurate estimates of infection severity of individuals are extremely valuable for the informed decision making and targeted response to an emerging pandemic. This paper presents machine learning based prognostic model for providing early warning to the individuals for COVID-19 infection using the health care data set. In the present work, a prognostic model using Random Forest classifier and support vector regression is developed for predicting the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19 and it is applied on an open health care data set containing 27 field values. The typical fields of the health care data set include basic personal details such as age, gender, number of children in the household, marital status along with medical data like Coma score, Pulmonary score, Blood Glucose level, HDL cholesterol etc. An effective preprocessing method is carried out for handling the numerical, categorical values (non-numerical), missing data in the health care data set. The correlation between the variables in the health care data is analyzed using the correlation coefficient and heat map with a color code is used to identify the influencing factors on the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. Based on the accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores, it is noted that the random forest classifier provides an improved classification performance as compared to Support vector regression for the given health care data set. Android based mobile application software platform is developed using the proposed prognostic approach for enabling the healthy individuals to predict the susceptibility infection score of COVID-19 to take the precautionary measures. Based on the results of the proposed method, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread

MethodsIn the present work, Random Forest classifier and support vector regression techniques are applied to a medical health care dataset containing 27 variables for predicting the susceptibility score of an individual towards COVID-19 infection and the accuracy of prediction is compared. An effective preprocessing is carried for handling the missing data in the health care data set. Correlation analysis using heat map is carried on the health care data for analyzing the influencing factors of Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. A confusion matrix is calculated for understanding the performance of classification of the based on the number of True-Positives, True-Negatives, False-Positives and False-Negatives. These values further used to calculate the accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores.

ResultsFrom the classification results, it is noted that the Random Forest classifier provides an classification accuracy of 99.7% precision of 99.8%, sensitivity of 98.8% and F-score of 99.29% for the given medical data set.

ConclusionProposed machine learning approach can help the individuals to take additional precautions for protecting people from the COVID-19 infection, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread.

372,"Identifying Optimal COVID-19 Testing Strategies for Schools and Businesses: Balancing Testing Frequency, Individual Test Technology, and Cost","BackgroundCOVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity have been widely examined and discussed yet optimal use of these tests will depend on the goals of testing, the population or setting, and the anticipated underlying disease prevalence. We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses.

MethodsWe coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, and test cost on outcomes case reduction.

ResultsIncreasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32.

ConclusionsA range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay.

We used a time-series analysis to discover how patterns of five indicators of mobility data relate to changes in Rt of 125 countries distributed over three groups based on Rt-mobility correlation. Group 1 included 71 countries in which Rt correlates negatively with residential and positively with other mobility indicators. Group 2 included 25 countries showing an opposite correlation pattern to Group 1. Group 3 included the 29 remaining countries. We chose the best-fit TL based on forecast and linear regression models. We used linear mixed models to evaluate how mobility indicators and the stringency index (SI) relate with Rt. SI reflects the strictness of governmental responses to COVID-19. With a median of 14 days, TLs varied across countries as well as across groups of countries. There was a strong negative correlation between SI and Rt in most countries belonging to Group 1 as opposed to Group 2. SI (units of 10%) associated with decreasing Rt in Group 1 [{beta} -0.15, 95% CI -0.15 - (-0.14)] and Group 3 [-0.05, -0.07 - (-0.03)], whereas, in Group 2, SI associated with increasing Rt (0.13, 0.11 - 0.16).

375,Summer School Holidays and the Growth Rate in Sars-CoV-2 Infections Across German Districts,"How significant are school holidays for the Covid-19 crisis? In this ecological study, we analyse the association between summer school holidays and the weekly growth rate in SARS-CoV-2 infections in 401 German districts. In Germany school holidays are coordinated between states and spread out in order to reduce the number and length of traffic jams on motorways. We employ a district fixed effects Chow-type structural break model specification in which we test whether the holiday season as well as the period of two weeks after holidays end result in a statistically significantly higher infection growth rate than the period of two weeks before holidays start, our presumed counterfactual. We also allow the effect to vary week-by-week and by states. We find that between 30 and 50 percent of the growth rate in new infections in Germany can be attributed to the holiday season. A significant increase in the growth of new infections begins approximately four weeks after holidays begin - that is, shortly after the first wave of holiday-makers return. The effect becomes stronger the further holidays proceed and does not revert back to normal in the two weeks after the end of holidays. States in the West of Germany tend to experience stronger effects than those in the East. Part of this finding is explained by another result, namely that we find significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a districts population.",Thomas Pluemper; Eric Neumayer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210773,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210773,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
376,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell signaling in lung vascular cells,"Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. So far, 30 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and nearly 1 million people have died because of COVID-19 worldwide, causing serious health, economical, and sociological problems. However, the mechanism of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human host cells has not been defined. The present study reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in lung vascular cells. The treatment of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells or human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Val16 - Gln690) at 10 ng/ml (0.13 nM) caused an activation of MEK phosphorylation. The activation kinetics was transient with a peak at 10 min. The recombinant protein that contains only the ACE2 receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Arg319 - Phe541), on the other hand, did not cause this activation. Consistent with the activation of cell growth signaling in lung vascular cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, pulmonary vascular walls were found to be thickened in COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.",Yuichiro J.

Systematic analysis of CUP of replicase (rdrp), spike, envelope (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid (N) encoding genes of SARS-CoV-2 from reported diverse lineages to suggest one-time host jump of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate into the human host. In contrast to human isolates, a high degree of variation in CUP of these genes suggests that bats, pangolins, and dogs are natural reservoirs of diverse strains. At the same time, our analysis suggests that dogs are not a source of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, CUP of rdrp displays conservation with two bat SARS isolates RaTG13 and RmYN02. CUP of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene is also conserved with bat and pangolin isolates with variations for a few amino acids. This suggests role allele replacement in these two genes involving SARS strains of least two hosts. At the same time, a relatively conserved CUP pattern in replicase and envelope across hosts suggests them it to be an ideal target in antiviral development for SARS-CoV-2.",Kanika Bansal; Prabhu B Patil,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335521,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335521,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False

We previously established unsupervised AI, a BLSOM (batch-learning SOM), which can analyze five million genomic sequences simultaneously. The present study applied the BLSOM to the oligonucleotide compositions of forty thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes. While only the oligonucleotide composition was given, the obtained clusters of genomes corresponded primarily to known main clades and internal divisions in the main clades.

Despite a low mutation rate, isolates with the D614G substitution in the S protein appeared early during the pandemic, and are now the dominant form worldwide. Here, we analyze the D614G mutation in the context of a soluble S ectodomain construct. Cryo-EM structures, antigenicity and proteolysis experiments suggest altered conformational dynamics resulting in enhanced furin cleavage efficiency of the G614 variant. Furthermore, furin cleavage altered the conformational dynamics of the Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) in the G614 S ectodomain, demonstrating an allosteric effect on the RBD dynamics triggered by changes in the SD2 region, that harbors residue 614 and the furin cleavage site. Our results elucidate SARS-CoV-2 spike conformational dynamics and allostery, and have implications for vaccine design.

382,Structural investigation of ACE2 dependent disassembly of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein,"The human membrane protein Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) acts as the main receptor for host cells invasion of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The viral surface glycoprotein Spike binds to hACE2, which triggers virus entry into cells. As of today, the role of hACE2 for virus fusion is not well understood. Blocking the transition of Spike from its prefusion to post-fusion state might be a strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19. Here we report a single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike in presence of the human ACE2 ectodomain. The binding of purified hACE2 ectodomain to Spike induces the disassembly of the trimeric form of Spike and a structural rearrangement of its S1 domain to form a stable, monomeric complex with hACE2.

383,Genomic Similarity of Nucleotides in SARS CoronaVirus using K-Means Unsupervised Learning Algorithm,"The drastic increase in the number of coronaviruses discovered and coronavirus genomes being sequenced have given us a great opportunity to perform genomics and bioinformatics analysis on this family of viruses. Coronaviruses possess the largest genomes (26.4 to 31.7 kb) among all known RNA viruses, with G + C contents varying from 32% to 43%. Phylogenetically, three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, with Betacoronavirus consisting of subgroups A, B, C were known to exist but now a new genus D also exists,namely the Deltacoronavirus. In such a situation, it becomes highly important for efficient classification of all virus data so that it helps us in suitable planning,containment and treatment. The objective of this paper is to classify SARS corona-virus nucleotide sequences based on parameters such as sequence length,percentage similarity between the sequence information,open and closed gaps in the sequence due to multiple mutations and many others.By doing this,we will be able to predict accurately the similarity of SARS CoV-2 virus with respect to other corona-viruses like the Wuhan corona-virus,the bat corona-virus and the pneumonia virus and would help us better understand about the taxonomy of the corona-virus family.

384,Sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 spike facilitate syncytia formation,"The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds the cell surface protein ACE2 to mediate fusion of the viral membrane with target cells1-4. S comprises a large external domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a short cytoplasmic tail5,6. To elucidate the intracellular trafficking of S protein in host cells we applied proteomics to identify cellular factors that interact with its cytoplasmic tail. We confirm interactions with components of the COPI, COPII and SNX27/retromer vesicle coats, and with FERM domain actin regulators and the WIPI3 autophagy component. The interaction with COPII promotes efficient exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and although COPI-binding should retain S in the early Golgi system where viral budding occurs, the binding is weakened by a suboptimal histidine residue in the recognition motif. As a result, S leaks to the surface where it accumulates as it lacks an endocytosis motif of the type found in many other coronaviruses7,8. It is known that when at the surface S can direct cell:cell fusion leading to the formation of multinucleate syncytia9-11. Thus, the trafficking signals in the cytoplasmic tail of S protein indicate that syncytia formation is not an inadvertent by-product of infection but rather a key aspect of the replicative cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and potential cause of pathological symptoms.",Jerome Cattin-Ortola; Lawrence Welch; Sarah L Maslen; J Mark Skehel; Guido Papa; Leo C James; Sean Munro,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335562,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335562,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
385,Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data,"The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities, known as multimodal analysis, represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates new computational methods that can define cellular states based on multiple data types. Here, we introduce  weighted-nearest neighbor analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.

386,Diagnostic Accuracy of FDA Authorized Serology Tests to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"ImportanceSerology tests are diagnostic and complementary to molecular tests during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Data sourcesA search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, and EMBASE up to April 4, 2020, was performed to identify studies using the ""COVID 19 testing"" and ""meta-analysis."" FDA website was accessed for the list of tests for emergency use authorization (EUA).

Study SelectionManufacturer reported serology tests published in the FDA website were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected reports.

Data extraction and synthesisThe meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A bivariate analysis using the ""random-effects model"" was applied for pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curves.

Main outcomes and measuresThe primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the serology test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subgroup analysis of the diagnostic accuracy with lag time between symptom onset and testing were studied.

ResultsSeven manufacturer listed reports were included. The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI, 78% - 93%), the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI, 97% - 100%), and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97. At [&le;] 7 days, sensitivity was 44% (95% CI, 21% - 70%), and for 8-14 days, sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 67 % - 94%).For blood draws [&ge;] 15 days after the onset of symptoms, sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% - 98%). Heterogeneity was substantial, and the risk of bias was low in this analysis.

Conclusions and relevanceFDA authorized serology tests demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection (certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test accuracy based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of evidence: low).

Key- points

QuestionsWhat is the pooled diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies?

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of seven reports from FDA authorized serology tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV2 antibodies (3336 patients/ samples) pooled sensitivity was 87%, and pooled specificity was almost 100%. There was a wide variation in test performance based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests.

MeaningFDA authorized tests are highly accurate to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antibodies if tests are performed under a similar condition, as presented in the original report. There is a wide variation in the test performance based on the time interval between the onset of symptoms to the tests.",Rajesh Pandey; Anand Gourishankar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208553,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208553,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
387,Assessing the Impact of Area Deprivation Index on COVID-19 Prevalence: A Contrast Between Rural and Urban U.S. Jurisdictions,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities differentially, with poorer and minority populations being more adversely affected. Prior rural health research suggests such disparities may be exacerbated during the pandemic and in remote parts of the U.S.

ObjectivesTo understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the U.S., county level data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were examined by Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores and Metropolitan vs. Nonmetropolitan designations from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These designations were the basis for making comparisons between Urban and Rural jurisdictions.

MethodsKendalls Tau-B was used to compare effect sizes between jurisdictions on select ADI composites and well researched social determinants of health (SDH). Spearman coefficients and a moderation analysis using Poisson modeling was used to explore the relationship between ADI and COVID-19 prevalence in the context of county designation.

ResultsResults show that the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence was positive and higher for rural counties, when compared to urban ones and that family income and poverty had a stronger relationship with prevalence than other ADI component measures.

ConclusionsThough most Americans live in Metropolitan Areas, rural communities were found to be associated with a stronger relationship between deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence. Models for predicting COVID-19 prevalence by ADI and county type reinforced this observation but revealed no moderating effect of county type on ADI.",Christopher Kitchen; Elham Hatef; Hsien Yen Chang; Jonathan Weiner; Hadi Kharrazi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208462,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208462,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
388,Long-term COVID-19 symptoms in a large unselected population,"It is increasingly recognized that SARS-CoV-2 can produce long-term complications after recovery from the acute effects of infection. Here, we report the analysis of 32 self-reported short and long-term symptoms in a general adult population cohort comprised of 233 COVID-19+ cases, 3,652 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, and 17,474 non-tested individuals. The majority of our COVID-19+ cases are mild, with only 8 of the 233 COVID-19+ cases having been hospitalized. Our results show that 43.4% of COVID-19+ cases have symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, and 24.1% still have at least one symptom after 90 days. These numbers are higher for COVID-19+ cases who were initially more ill, 59.4% at 30 days and 40.6% at 90 days, but even for very mild and initially asymptomatic cases, 14.3% have complications persist for 30 days or longer. In contrast, only 8.6% of participants from the general untested population develop new symptoms lasting longer than 30 days due to any illness during the same study period. The long-term symptoms most enriched in those with COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnea, memory loss, confusion, headache, heart palpitations, chest pain, pain with deep breaths, dizziness, and tachycardia. We additionally observe that individuals who had an initial symptom of dyspnea are significantly more likely to develop long-term symptoms. Importantly, our study finds that the overall level of illness is an important variable to account for when assessing the statistical significance of symptoms that are associated with COVID-19. Our study provides a baseline from which to understand the frequency of COVID-19 long-term symptoms at the population level and demonstrates that, although those most likely to develop long-term COVID-19 complications are those who initially have more severe illness, even those with mild or asymptomatic courses of infection are at increased risk of long-term complications.",Elizabeth Cirulli; Kelly M Schiabor Barrett; Stephen Riffle; Alexandre Bolze; Iva Neveux; Shaun Dabe; Joseph J Grzymski; James T Lu; Nicole L Washington,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208702,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208702,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True

390,Lockdown impact on age-specific contact patterns and behaviours in France,"In the first trimester 2020, a significant number of countries implemented general lockdowns of their populations to contain the quickly expanding SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and avoid major saturation of health care capacity. Understanding how these unprecedented measures impacted population behaviour and contact patterns is key to predict more accurately the health, social and economic impacts of such extreme actions if they were to be applied to future outbreaks. We set up an online survey to measure how the lockdown affected social contact patterns in France, and collected information from 42,036 participants aged 18 years and over between April 10 and April 28, 2020. Among the participants who normally worked outside home prior to the lockdown (72% of the survey population), 68% reported that they had moved to working from home and 17% reported being unemployed during the lockdown.

Only 2% of participants used public transport during lockdown, as opposed to 37% before it. Participants reported increased frequency of washing hands, switch in greeting behaviour, but generally limited use of masks outside home. 138,934 contacts were reported, with an average 3.3 contacts per individual per day (1.7 for individuals aged >65 years old compared to 3.6 for younger age-groups). This represented a 70% reduction compared with previous surveys, consistent with reductions in transmission rates measured during the lockdown. Contacts in workplaces, shops, and transports on the previous day were respectively reported in only 11%, 31% and 0.5% of the participants. For those who maintained a professional activity outside home, the frequency of contacts at work dropped by 79%. This study shows that the lockdown dramatically affected populations behavior, work, risk perception and contact patterns. Both frequency and heterogeneity of contacts were affected, impacting potential important features of virus dissemination. Such surveys are essential to evaluate more accurately the impact of past or future lockdowns and anticipate epidemic dynamics in these conditions.",Paolo Bosetti; Bich-Tram Huynh; Armiya Youssouf Abdou; Marie Sanchez; Catherine Eisenhauer; Noémie Courtejoie; Jérôme Accardo; Henrik Salje; Didier Guillemot; Mathieu Moslonka-Lefebvre; Pierre-Yves Boëlle; Guillaume Béraud; Simon Cauchemez; Lulla Opatowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20205104,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20205104,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
391,DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING COVID-19 ADVERSE OUTCOME RISK PREDICTION MODELS FROM A BI-NATIONAL EUROPEAN COHORT OF 5594 PATIENTS.,"BackgroundPatients with severe COVID-19 have overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. We hypothesized that Machine Learning (ML) models could be used to predict risks at different stages of management (at diagnosis, hospital admission and ICU admission) and thereby provide insights into drivers and prognostic markers of disease progression and death.

MethodsFrom a cohort of approx. 2.6 million citizens in the two regions of Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed on subjects suspected for COVID-19 disease; 3944 cases had at least one positive test and were subjected to further analysis. A cohort of SARS- CoV-2 positive cases from the United Kingdom Biobank was used for external validation.

FindingsThe ML models predicted the risk of death (Receiver Operation Characteristics - Area Under the Curve, ROC-AUC) of 0.904 at diagnosis, 0.818, at hospital admission and 0.723 at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Similar metrics were achieved for predicted risks of hospital and ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation. We identified some common risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension as driving factors, although the top risk features shifted towards markers of shock and organ dysfunction in ICU patients. The external validation indicated fair predictive performance for mortality prediction, but suboptimal performance for predicting ICU admission.

InterpretationML may be used to identify drivers of progression to more severe disease and for prognostication patients in patients with COVID-19. Prognostic features included age, BMI and hypertension, although markers of shock and organ dysfunction became more important in more severe cases.

We provide access to an online risk calculator based on these findings.

393,Prevalence and Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Healthcare Workers: A Single Center Study,"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence as a marker of prior infection in a spectrum of healthcare workers (HCWs) may guide risk stratification and enactment of better health policies and procedures.

The present study reported on cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, between May and August, 2020.

Data from HCWs (n=3,458) were included in the analysis. Data from first responders (n=226) were also analyzed for comparison. A blood sample was collected at study enrollment and 8-week follow-up. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Comparisons to estimated community prevalence were also evaluated.

Observed antibody prevalence was 0.93% and 2.58% at initial and 8-week follow-up, respectively, for HCWs, and 5.31% and 4.35% for first responders. For HCWs, significant differences (p < .05) between negative vs. positive at initial assessment were found for age, race, fever, and loss of smell, and at 8-week follow-up for age, race, and all symptoms. Antibody positivity persisted at least 8 weeks in this cohort. Among 75 HCWs with self-reported prior PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 35 (46.7%) were antibody negative. Significant differences between negative vs. positive were observed in age and frequency of symptoms.

This study found considerably lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among HCWs compared with prior published studies. This may be explained by better safety measures in the workplace, heightened awareness inside and outside of the workplace, possibly lower susceptibility due to innate immunity and other biological heterogeneity, and low COVID-19 prevalence in the community itself. HCWs with initial positive results had persistent positive serologies at 8 weeks. Further research is warranted to investigate factors influencing such lower prevalence in our HCWs.",Michael Brant-Zawadzki; Deborah Fridman; Philip Robinson; Matthew Zahn; Clayton Chau; Randy German; Marcus Breit; Elmira Burke; Jason R.

394,District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India,"BackgroundThe number of patients with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has amplified in India. Understanding the district level correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio (IR) is therefore essential for formulating policies and intervention.

ObjectivesThe present study examines the association between socio-economic and demographic characteristics of Indias population and the COVID-19 infection ratio at district level...

Data and MethodsUsing crowdsourced data on the COVID-19 prevalence rate, we analyzed state and district level variation in India from March 14 to July 31 2020. We identified hotspot and cold spot districts for COVID-19 cases and infection ratio. We have also carried out a regression analysis to highlight the district level demographic, socio-economic, infrastructure, and health-related correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio.

ResultsThe results showed that the IR is 42.38 per one hundred thousand population in India. The highest IR was observed in Andhra Pradesh (145.0), followed by Maharashtra (123.6), and was the lowest in Chhattisgarh (10.1). About 80 per cent of infected cases, and 90 per cent of deaths were observed in nine Indian states (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Gujarat). Moreover, we observed COVID-19 cold-spots in central, northern, western, and north-eastern regions of India. Out of 736 districts, six metropolitan cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Thane, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad) emerged as the major hotspots in India, containing around 30 per cent of confirmed total COVID-19 cases in the country. Simultaneously, parts of the Konkan coast in Maharashtra, parts of Delhi, the southern part of Tamil Nadu, the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir were identified as hotspots of COVID-19 infection. Morans-I value of 0.333showed a positive spatial clusteringlevel in the COVID-19 IR case over neighboring districts. Our regression analysis found that district-level population density ({beta}: 0.05, CI:004-0.06), the percent of urban population ({beta}:3.08, CI: 1.05-5.11), percent of Scheduled Caste Population ({beta}: 3.92, CI: 0.12-7.72),and district-level testing ratio ({beta}: 0.03, CI: 0.01-0.04) are positively associated with the prevalence of COVID-19.

ConclusionCOVID-19 cases were heavily concentrated in 9 states of India. Several demographic, socio-economic, and health-related variables are correlated with COVID-19 prevalence rate. However, after adjusting the role of socio-economic and health-related factors, the COVID-19 infection rate was found to be more rampant in districts with a higher population density, a higher percentage of the urban population, and a higher percentage of deprived castes and with a higher level of testing ratio.

This study aims to provide preliminary information about the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases among students attending Italian schools.

MethodsData are extracted and analysed from an open access, online dataset that monitor, on a daily basis, media news about SARS-CoV-2 infections of students attending Italian schools

ResultsAs of 5 October 2020, a total of 1350 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been registered in the Italian territory schools (involving 1059 students, 145 teachers and 146 other school members), for a total of 1212 out of 65104 (1.8%) Italian schools involved. National schools reported only 1 case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in more than 90% of cases, and only in one high school a cluster of more than 10 cases have been described (P 0.015). The detection of one or more SARS-CoV-2 infections leaded to the closure of 192 (14.2%) entire schools, more frequently nursery/kindergartens (P<0.0005).

DiscussionOur preliminary data support low transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within schools, at least among younger students. However, entire schools are frequently closed in the fear of larger outbreaks.

DesignA Clinical trial registry of India registered observational study (CTRI/2020/05/025247).

SettingCertified COVID hospital located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.

Participants549 COVID positive patients hospitalized between 15 th May to 10 th August, 2020 and treated in ICU and non ICU settings.

Main Outcome MeasureComparative analysis of demographic, clinical characteristics, investigations, treatment, complications and outcome of COVID patients in ICU and non ICU settings.

ResultsOf the 549 hospitalized COVID positive patients, 159 were admitted in ICU during disease course while 390 had ward admissions. Overall median age was 52 (1-86) years. The ICU group was older (>65years), with associated comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes (p<0.001); higher proportion of males (79.25%); with dyspnea as a major clinical characteristic and consolidation in lungs as a major radiological finding as compared to ward patients. C - reactive protein, D-Dimer and Ferritin were higher in ICU patients. Overall 50% females depicted elevated Ferritin levels. Steriods(92.45%)and tocilizumab (69.18%) were more frequently used for ICU patients. Remdesivir was prescribed to both ICU and non ICU patients. Favirapir was also a line of treatment for 25% of ICU patients. Convalescent plasma therapy was given to 7 ICU patients. Complications like acute kidney injury (13.84%), shock (10.69 %), sepsis and encephalopathy were observed in ICU patients. Overall mortality rate was 5.47 % with higher mortality among males in comparison to females (p<0.0001).

ConclusionAbout 29% of overall patients required ICU admission that was commonly elderly males.

397,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in East London: a retrospective cohort analysis,"BackgroundDescriptions of clinical characteristics of patients hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their clinical course and short-term in- and outpatient outcomes in deprived urban populations in the United Kingdom are still relatively sparse. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, experience of non-invasive ventilation and intensive care, mortality and short-term sequalae of patients admitted to two large District General Hospitals across a large East London NHS Trust during the first wave of the pandemic.

MethodsA retrospective analysis was carried out on a cohort of 1,946 patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, including descriptive statistics and survival analysis. A more detailed analysis was undertaken of a subset of patients admitted across three Respiratory Units in the trust.

ResultsIncreasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 67% of survivors, with 42% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms.

ConclusionsUnderstanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be vital in preparing for further peaks of the pandemic. Our initial follow up data suggest there are ongoing sequalae of COVID-19 including persistent symptoms and radiological abnormalities. Further data, including longer term follow up data, are necessary to improve our understanding of this novel pathogen and associated disease.

Section 1: What is already known on this topicPrevious studies have reported that increasing age, male sex, Black and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is little published literature regarding the follow up of patients with COVID-19.

Section 2: What this study addsOur study is one of the first with follow up data for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We show that radiological abnormality persisted at 6 weeks in over 50% of patients, as well as significantly increased breathlessness in patients without baseline dyspnoea. Our study confirms that increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients, but also in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population in East London.",Daryl Cheng; Claire Calderwood; Erik Skyllberg; Adam Ainley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20193623,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20193623,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
398,Risk of death during the 2020 UK COVID-19 epidemic among people with rare autoimmune diseases compared to the general population. Preliminary results from the RECORDER project.,"ObjectivesTo quantify the risk of death among people with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) during the UK 2020 COVID-19 epidemic compared with baseline risk and the risk of death in the general population during COVID-19.

DesignA cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). We used ONS published data for general population mortality rates.

SettingHospital Episode Statistics for England 2003 onwards, and linked data from the NHS Personal Demographics Service.

Participants168,691 people with RAIRD who were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. Our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%.

Main outcome measureAge-standardised mortality rates for all-cause death. Secondary outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality rates.

Results1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4-3838.1 per 100,000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of England it was 1.38 times higher. Compared to the general population, the age-specific mortality rates in people with RAIRD compared to the pre-COVID rates were higher from the age of 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk began from age 55 upwards. Sex-specific rates were similar in males and females, whereas in the general population females had a lower rate than males.

ConclusionsThe risk of all-cause death is more prominently raised during COVID-19 among people with RAIRD than among the general population. We urgently need to quantify how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how much is due to disruption to healthcare services, in order to inform better guidance about shielding, access to healthcare and vaccine priorities for people with rare diseases.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSPeople with rare diseases often suffer worse health outcomes than people with more common diseases. Little is known about the risks to people with rare diseases during COVID-19. The OPENSAFELY study found people with common autoimmune diseases were at little increased risk due to COVID-19.

What this study addsThis is the first study to quantify the risk of death among people with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) during COVID-19.

People with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) had an increased risk of death compared to their pre-COVID risk that is slightly higher than in the general population.

People with RAIRD had an increased risk of death, compared to their pre-COVID risk, from age 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk occurred from around age 55 upwards. Because females and males with RAIRD had similar age-standardised mortality rates during COVID-19, but females had lower rates pre-COVID and in the general population during COVID-19, the group at the largest increase of risk compared to their pre-COVID-19 risk were women aged 35 upwards.

399,Extended laboratory panel testing in the Emergency Department for risk-stratification of patients with COVID-19: a single centre retrospective service evaluation,"BackgroundThe role of specific blood tests to predict poor prognosis in patients admitted with infection from SARS-CoV2 virus remains uncertain. During the first wave of the global pandemic, an extended laboratory testing panel was integrated into the local pathway to guide triage and healthcare resource utilisation for emergency admissions. We conducted a retrospective service evaluation to determine the utility of extended tests (D-dimer, ferritin, high-sensitivity troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin) compared to the core panel (full blood count, urea & electrolytes, liver function tests, C-reactive protein).

MethodsClinical outcomes for adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted between 17th March to 30st June 2020 were extracted, alongside costs estimates for individual tests. Prognostic performance was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis with 28-day mortality used as the primary endpoint, and a composite of 28-day intensive care escalation or mortality for secondary analysis.

ResultsFrom 13,500 emergency attendances we identified 391 unique adults admitted with COVID-19. Of these, 113 died (29%) and 151 (39%) reached the composite endpoint. ""Core"" test variables adjusted for age, gender and index of deprivation had a prognostic AUC of 0.79 (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.67 to 0.91) for mortality and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84) for the composite endpoint. Addition of ""extended"" test components did not improve upon this.

400,Age-targeted dose allocation can halve COVID-19 vaccine requirements,"In anticipation of COVID-19 vaccine deployment, we use an age-structured mathematical model to investigate the benefits of optimizing age-specific dose allocation to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Across 179 countries, we find that the highest priority individuals are typically those between 30 and 59 years of age because of their high contact rates and higher risk of infection and disease. We reaffirm that vaccination alone may be insufficient to achieve herd immunity in some settings, and that additional intervention measures may be required.

401,Exclusion of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 using baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotics,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is infrequently complicated by secondary bacterial infection, but nevertheless antibiotic prescriptions are common. We used community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a benchmark to define the processes that occur in a bacterial pulmonary infection, and tested the hypothesis that baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotic therapy could distinguish CAP from COVID-19.

MethodsIn patients admitted to Royal Free Hospital (RFH) and Barnet Hospital (BH) we defined CAP by lobar consolidation on chest radiograph, and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. Data were derived from routine laboratory investigations.

ResultsOn admission all CAP and >90% COVID-19 patients received antibiotics. We identified 106 CAP and 619 COVID-19 patients at RFH. CAP was characterised by elevated white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to COVID-19 (median WCC 12.48 (IQR 8.2-15.3) vs 6.78 (IQR 5.2-9.5) x106 cells/ml and median CRP CRP 133.5 (IQR 65-221) vs 86 (IQR 42-160) mg/L). Blood samples collected 48-72 hours into admission revealed decreasing CRP in CAP but not COVID-19 (CRP difference -33 (IQR -112 to +3.5) vs +15 (IQR -15 to +70) mg/L respectively). In the independent validation cohort (BH) consisting of 169 CAP and 181 COVID-19 patients, admission WCC >8.2x106 cells/ml or falling CRP during admission identified 95% of CAP cases, and predicted the absence of bacterial co-infection in 45% of COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsWe propose that in COVID-19 the absence of both elevated baseline WCC and antibiotic-related decrease in CRP can exclude bacterial co-infection and facilitate antibiotic stewardship efforts.",Claire Y Mason; Tanmay Kanitkar; Charlotte J Richardson; Marisa Lanzman; Zak Stone; Tabitha Mahungu; Damien Mack; Emmanuel Q Wey; Lucy Lamb; Indran Balakrishnan; Gabriele Pollara,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20199778,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20199778,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
402,SARS-CoV-2 genomic characterization and clinical manifestation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay,"COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and declared by the World Health Organization a global public health emergency. Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation.

403,"Factors associated with progression to critical illness in 28 days among COVID-19 patients: results from a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul, Turkey","BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread worldwide to become a pandemic. This study aimed to define the predictors of critical illness development within 28 days postadmission.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study including 477 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul from March 12 to May 12, 2020. The development of critical illness, e.g., invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death, was followed for a period of 28 days postadmission. Demographic characteristics, number of comorbidities, illness severity at admission defined by the WHO scale, vital signs, laboratory findings and period of admission to the hospital were independent variables. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed, and the C-index was calculated.

ResultsThe median (IQR) age of the cohort was 55.0 (44.0-67.0) years, and 50.1% were male. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, dyspnea and fatigue. Overall, 65.2% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Hydroxychloroquine was given to 99.2% of the patients. Critical illness developed in 45 (9.4%; 95% CI: 7.0%-12.4%) patients. In the multivariable analysis, age (HR: 1.05, p<0.001), number of comorbidities (HR: 1.33, p=0.02), procalcitonin [&ge;]0.25 {micro}g/L (HR: 2.12, p=0.03) and LDH [&ge;]350 U/L (HR: 2.04, p=0.03) were independently associated with critical illness development. The WHO scale on admission was the strongest predictor of critical illness (HR: 4.15, p<0.001). Prognosis improved within the study period (p<0.05). The C-index of the model was 0.92.

ConclusionsAge, comorbidity number, WHO scale, LDH and procalcitonin were independently associated with critical illness development. Mortality from COVID-19 seems to be decreasing as the pandemic advances.

404,Low zinc levels at clinical admission associates with poor outcomes in COVID-19,"BackgroundBiomarkers to predict Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcome early at infection are urgently needed to improve prognosis and treatment. Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two groups with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression and thus might represent a useful biomarker.

MethodsWe run a retrospective observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel we have studied SARS-CoV2 replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations.

FindingsOur study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 {micro}g/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV2 infected cells.

InterpretationSZC is a novel biomarker to predict COVID-19 outcome. We encourage performing randomized clinical trials to study zinc supplementation as potential prophylaxis and treatment with people at risk of zinc deficiency.

405,"Enoxaparin is associated with lower rates of thrombosis, kidney injury, and mortality than Unfractionated Heparin in hospitalized COVID patients","Although anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, e.g. enoxaparin) are both being used for therapeutic mitigation of COVID associated coagulopathy (CAC), differences in their clinical outcomes remain to be investigated. Here, we employ automated neural networks supplemented with expert curation ( augmented curation) for retrospectively analyzing the complete electronic health records (EHRs) of 671 hospitalized COVID-19 patients administered either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, but not both. We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have higher rates of mortality (risk ratio: 2.6; 95% C.I.: [1.2-5.4]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.09), thrombotic events (risk ratio: 5.7, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024), acute kidney injury (risk ratio: 5.5; 95% C.I.: [1.2-17.7]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.10), and bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio undefined; 95% C.I.: [1.0, 292]; p-value:0.02; BH adjusted p-value:0.10), compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin. Notably, even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, initial ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support, the above differences between the enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin patient cohorts remain statistically significant.

MethodsSurrogate clinical specimens were prepared by inoculating foam and polyester nasal swabs with residual SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens diluted in porcine or human matrix. Dry swab elution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was evaluated by vortex, swab swirling, and passive methodologies. Surrogate and clinical nasal specimen stability were evaluated at refrigerated (4{degrees}C) and elevated temperatures (40{degrees}C for 12 hours, 32{degrees}C hold) through 72 hours.

ResultsPolyester swabs demonstrated equivalent performance to foam swabs for detection of low and high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Dry swab elution performed with PBS and mechanical disruption by vortex resulted in nearly complete quantitative recovery of virus. Dry polyester and foam surrogate specimens were stable through 72 hours both when refrigerated and after high temperature excursion, which simulated specimen transport without cold chain. Similarly, clinical specimens collected with polyester swabs and stored dry were stable through 72 hours in the presence and absence of cold chain. Polyester surrogate specimens stored in saline were stable through 72 hours refrigerated but only through 48 hours at elevated temperatures.

407,Evaluating the Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Rates on College Campuses to Wastewater Surveillance,"As college campuses reopen, we are in the midst of a large-scale experiment on the efficacy of various strategies to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Traditional individual surveillance testing via nasal swabs and/or saliva is among the measures that colleges are pursuing to reduce the spread of the virus on campus. Additionally, some colleges are testing wastewater on their campuses for signs of infection, which can provide an early warning signal for campuses to locate COVID-positive individuals. However, a representation of wastewater surveillance has not yet been incorporated into epidemiological models for college campuses, nor has the efficacy of wastewater screening been evaluated relative to traditional individual surveillance testing, within the structure of these models. Here, we implement a new model component for wastewater surveillance within an established epidemiological model for college campuses. We use a hypothetical residential university to evaluate the efficacy of wastewater surveillance to maintain low infection rates. We find that wastewater sampling with a 1-day lag to initiate individual screening tests, plus completing the subsequent tests within a 4-day period can keep overall infections within 5% of the infection rates seen with traditional individual surveillance testing. Our results also indicate that wastewater surveillance can be an effective way to dramatically reduce the number of false positive cases by identifying subpopulations for surveillance testing where infectious individuals are more likely to be found. Through a Monte Carlo risk analysis, we find that surveillance testing that relies solely on wastewater sampling can be fragile against scenarios with high viral reproductive numbers and high rates of infection of campus community members by outside sources. These results point to the practical importance of additional surveillance measures to limit the spread of the virus on campus and the necessity of a proactive response to the initial signs of outbreak.

Author SummaryCollege campuses have employed a variety of measures to keep their communities safe amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Many colleges are implementing surveillance testing programs wherein students are randomly selected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2. These strategies aim to manage the number of infections among the student population by isolating infected individuals. Some colleges are monitoring wastewater on their campuses for signs of the virus, which has been found to be capable of detecting viral RNA. If a wastewater sample shows signs of viral RNA, then screening tests are administered to the individuals who live or work in the buildings that contribute to the sewer in question. We present a model for such wastewater surveillance within a larger model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on a college campus. We show that wastewater surveillance can reduce the number of false positive cases and the associated disruptions to student life, while maintaining similar overall numbers of infections. However, we find that surveillance testing strategies that rely solely on wastewater sampling may be less effective if the local transmission rate of the virus is high, or if the rate of infection of members of the campus community by outside sources is high.",Tony E Wong; George M Thurston; Nathaniel Barlow; Nathan Cahill; Lucia Carichino; Kara Maki; David Ross; Jennifer Schneider,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210245,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210245,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
408,Epidemiology of sleep disorders during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic scoping review,"BackgroundA growing burden of mental health problems has become a global concern amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Sleep disorders are major mental health problems associated with increased psychosocial stressors; however, no research synthesis is available on the epidemiology of it. In this systematic scoping review, we aimed to assess the current evidence on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature.

MethodSeven major health databases and additional sources were searched to identify, evaluate, and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available interventions. The Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review were used, and the findings were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist.

ResultsA total of 78 articles were retrieved, the prevalence of sleeping disorders ranged from 2.3% to 76.6%. Age, sex, level of education, physical and mental health, COVID-19 related factors, occupation especially being health care workers (HCW) were the main associated factors. Only two intentions were identified to address the issue.

ConclusionThe finding of this review indicated a high burden of sleep disorder with limited interventions that necessitate informing policymakers and practitioners to facilitate future research and implementations.

Brief summaryO_ST_ABSCurrent Knowledge/Study RationaleC_ST_ABSDespite the paramount importance of sleep for the physical and mental wellbeing of individuals, sleep hygiene is often neglected which resulted in a high prevalence of sleep disorders across the globe.

409,When lockdown policies amplify social inequalities in COVID-19 infections. Evidence from a cross-sectional population-based survey in France.,"ObjectivesTo assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown

DesignA cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown.

Participants10 401 participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19.

Main outcomeThe main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than three days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown.

ResultsIn all, 1,304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0%-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8% to 4.3%, P=0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9% before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P=0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being contaminated during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57% among working class individuals (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.0-2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29).

InterpretationLockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.

Section 1: What is already known on this topicSignificant differences in COVID-19 incidence by gender, class and race/ethnicity are recorded in many countries in the world. Lockdown measures implemented throughout the globe have been effective in reducing transmission risks.

Section 2: What this study addsOur study shows that lockdowns impact was socially differentiated and has benefited the working classes the least. Such results underline the need to design COVID-19 preventive policies that take into account living and working conditions, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.",Nathalie BAJOS,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208595,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208595,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
410,Global projections of potential lives saved from COVID-19 through universal mask use,"BackgroundSocial distancing mandates have been effective at reducing the health impacts of COVID-19. The ensuing economic downturns and unemployment increases have led many nations to progressively relax mandates. As COVID-19 transmission and deaths rise in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuing widespread transmission elsewhere, policymakers are searching for options to reduce COVID-19 mortality without re-imposing strict social distancing mandates.

MethodsUsing a Bayesian meta-regression of 40 studies measuring the impact of mask use on respiratory viral infections, we estimated the reduction in transmission associated with the use of cloth or paper masks used in a general population setting. We used data from daily surveys conducted by Facebook, YouGov, and Premise, on the proportion of people reporting always wearing a mask outside their home for nearly all countries. We predicted deaths and infections until January 1st 2021 under a reference and universal mask use scenario using a deterministic transmission dynamics model with categories for susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR). In the reference scenario, we assume continued easing of mandates but with action to re-impose mandates for a period of six weeks, at a level of eight daily deaths per million population. The universal mask scenario assumed scaling up of mask use to 95% over a one-week period.

FindingsUse of simple masks can reduce transmission of COVID-19 by 40% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 20% - 54%). Universal mask use would lead to a reduction of 815,600 deaths (95% UI 430,600 to 1,491,000 deaths) between August 26th 2020 and January 1st 2021, the difference between the predicted 3.00 million deaths (95% UI 2.20 to 4.52 million) in the reference and 2.18 million deaths (95% UI 1.71 to 3.14 million) in the universal mask scenario over this time period. Mask use was estimated at 59.0% of people globally on August 18th, ranging from 41.9% in North Africa and the Middle East to 79.2% in Latin America and the Caribbean. The effect of universal mask use is greatest in countries such as India (158,832 fewer deaths in universal mask scenario, 95% UI 75,152 to 282,838 deaths), the United States of America (93,495 fewer deaths; 95% UI 59,329 to 150,967 deaths), and Russia (68,531 fewer deaths; 95% UI 34,249 to 145,960 deaths).

InterpretationThe rising toll of the COVID-19 pandemic can be substantially reduced by the universal adoption of masks. This low-cost policy, whether customary or mandated, has enormous health benefits and likely large economic benefits as well, by delaying the need for re-imposition of social distancing mandates.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOne meta-analysis of 21 studies reported a pooled reduction in the risk of respiratory virus infection of 47% (95% CI 36-79%) from a subset of eight studies reporting on mask use in non-health workers but it did not distinguish type of mask. Another meta-analysis reported on 26 studies of mask use in health workers and three studies in non-healthcare settings, reported a pooled effect of a 66% (55-74%) reduction in infections and a reduction by 44% (21-60%) in the three non-healthcare setting studies. Several survey series regularly measure self-reported mask use but results from these different sources have not previously been pooled to derive daily estimates of mask use over the course of the epidemic. Global models of the impact of scaled up mask use have to our knowledge not been published.

Added value of this studyWe combined the studies on mask use identified in the two meta-analyses and added one further study. In a Bayesian meta-regression approach, we derived the effect of simple cloth or paper masks used outside of a healthcare setting. In the meta-regression we make use of all the information provided by all of these studies, rather than subsetting to just those studies that provided the direct comparison of interest. Pooling estimates on the prevalence of self-reported mask use from three survey series provides up-to-date information on trends in mask use in almost all countries. We use extensive survey data covering nearly every country in the world to assess recent trends and current mask use. We then use an SEIR transmission dynamics model with good predictive validity to assess the potential of scaled up mask use to reduce global mortality from COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidenceUniversal mask use can save many lives and avoid or, at least, delay the need for re-imposition of social mandates (such as stay-at-home orders, curfews, etc.), which would also contribute to ameliorating the negative effects of COVID-19 on the economy and unemployment. Until an affordable vaccine becomes universally available, mandating mask use is the most attractive policy option available to all countries, particularly if an expected increased transmission risk occurs in the Northern hemispheres fall and winter. Simple face coverings are cheap and effective; one of the few available interventions that is widely available to everyone. Countries with currently low mask use will need to determine the optimal balance between encouraging the use of masks through advocacy and information about their benefits, and governance of a compulsory use associated with penalties for non-compliance.",Emmanuela Gakidou; - IHME COVID-19 Forecasting Team,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209510,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209510,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
411,Development of wastewater pooled surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 from congregate living settings,"Wastewater-based monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 holds promise as tool to inform public health-decision making. Testing at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of preventing early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Sample collection protocols were developed and refined during preliminary sampling from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Optimized sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n=105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. However, if the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive then the sensitivity would be 95.2% but the specificity would drop to 52%. We determined a highly sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 shedding in building wastewater however our methods could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future work must focus on methods to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to widely deploy this promising wastewater surveillance tool.",Lisa M Colosi; Katie E Barry; Shireen M Kotay; Michael D Porter; Melinda D Poulter; Cameron Ratliff; William Simmons; Rena G Morse; Limor I Steinberg; D.

412,Single-dose intranasal administration of AdCOVID elicits systemic and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in mice,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.",Rodney G. King; Aaron Silva-Sanchez; Jessica N.

413,The landscape of antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2,"The search for potential antibody-based diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has focused almost exclusively on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins1-8. Coronavirus membrane (M), orf3a, and orf8 proteins are also humoral immunogens in other coronaviruses (CoVs)8-11 but remain largely uninvestigated for SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust antibody responses to epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, particularly in M, in which one epitope achieved near-perfect diagnostic accuracy. We map 79 B cell epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies appear to bind homologous peptide sequences in the 6 known human CoVs. Our results demonstrate previously unknown, highly reactive B cell epitopes throughout the full proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV proteins, especially M, which should be considered in diagnostic, vaccine, and therapeutic development.",Anna S Heffron; Sean J McIlwain; David A Baker; Maya F Amjadi; Saniya Khullar; Ajay K Sethi; Miriam A Shelef; Irene M Ong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334292,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334292,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,False
414,The human brain vasculature shows a distinct expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors,"A large number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients show neurological symptoms such as ischemic- and hemorrhagic stroke as well as encephalitis, and SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect endothelial cells leading to endotheliitis across multiple vascular beds. These findings suggest an involvement of the brain- and peripheral vasculature in COVID-19, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 tropism for brain vasculature, we constructed a molecular atlas of the expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry-associated genes (receptors and proteases) and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners in human (and mouse) adult and fetal brain as well as in multiple non-CNS tissues in single-cell RNA-sequencing data across various datasets. We observed a distinct expression pattern of the cathepsins B (CTSB) and -L (CTSL) - which are able to substitute for the ACE2 co-receptor TMPRSS2 - in the human vasculature with CTSB being mainly expressed in the brain vasculature and CTSL predominantly in the peripheral vasculature, and these observations were confirmed at the protein level in the Human Protein Atlas and using immunofluorescence stainings. This expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viral-entry associated proteases and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners was also present in endothelial cells and microglia in the fetal brain, suggesting a developmentally established SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery in the human vasculature. At both the adult and fetal stages, we detected a distinct pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes transcripts in brain vascular endothelial cells and microglia, providing a potential explanation for an inflammatory response in the brain endothelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, CTSB was co-expressed in adult and fetal brain endothelial cells with genes and pathways involved in innate immunity and inflammation, angiogenesis, blood-brain-barrier permeability, vascular metabolism, and coagulation, providing a potential explanation for the role of brain endothelial cells in clinically observed (neuro)vascular symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Our study serves as a publicly available single-cell atlas of SARS-CoV-2 related entry factors and interaction partners in human and mouse brain endothelial- and perivascular cells, which can be employed for future studies in clinical samples of COVID-19 patients.",Moheb Ghobrial; Jason Charish; Shigeki Takada; Taufik Valiante; Philippe Monnier; Ivan Radovanovic; Gary Bader; Thomas Wälchli,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334664,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334664,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,False
415,Kidney injury molecule-1 is a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 patients present high incidence of kidney abnormalities, which are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism and direct infection. Presently, it is generally recognized that SARS-CoV-2 initiates invasion through binding of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to host cell-membrane receptor ACE2, however, whether there is additional target of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney remains unclear. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1) is a transmembrane protein that drastically up-regulated after renal injury. Here, binding between SARS-CoV2-RBD and the extracellular Ig V domain of KIM1 was identified by molecular simulations and co-immunoprecipitation, which was comparable in affinity to that of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, KIM1 facilitated cell entry of SARS-CoV2-RBD, which was potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide. Together, the findings suggest KIM1 may mediate and exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in a  vicious cycle, and KIM1 could be further explored as a therapeutic target.",Chen Yang; Yu Zhang; Hong Chen; Yuchen Chen; Dong Yang; ZiWei Shen; Xiaomu Wang; Xinran Liu; Mingrui Xiong; Kun Huang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334052,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334052,2020-10-10,2020-10-10,,False

Here, we developed a synthetic soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) DNA-based vaccine candidate, GX-19. In mice, immunization with GX-19 elicited not only S-specific systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but also Th1-biased T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. GX-19 vaccinated nonhuman primate seroconverted rapidly and exhibited detectable neutralizing antibody response as well as multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Notably, when the immunized nonhuman primates were challenged at 10 weeks after the last vaccination with GX-19, they did not develop fever and reduced viral loads in contrast to non-vaccinated primates as a control. These findings indicate that GX-19 vaccination provides durable protective immune response and also support further development of GX-19 as a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 in human clinical trials.",Yong Bok Seo; You Suk Suh; Ji In Ryu; Hwanhee Jang; Hanseul Oh; Bon-Sang Koo; Sang-Hwan Seo; Jung Joo Hong; Manki Song; Sung-Joo Kim; Young Chul Sung,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334136,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334136,2020-10-10,2020-10-10,,False

We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, >99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses.

DesignThe review was designed as a rapid systematic review to capture an evolving evidence base. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement.

SettingThe review included models led by primary and secondary care across seven countries.

Participants17 examples of models were included in the review.

Main outcome measuresImpact of remote home monitoring on virtual length of stay, escalation, emergency department attendance/reattendance, admission/readmission and mortality.

ResultsThe aim of the models was to maintain patients safe in the right setting. Most models were led by secondary care and confirmation of COVID-19 was not required (in most cases). Monitoring was carried via online platforms, paper-based systems with telephone calls or (less frequently) through wearable sensors. Models based on phone calls were considered more inclusive. Patient/carer training was identified as a determining factor of success. We could not reach conclusions regarding patient safety and the identification of early deterioration due to lack of standardised reporting and missing data. Economic analysis was not reported beyond how the resources were used.

ConclusionsFuture research should focus on staff and patient experiences of care and inequalities in patients access to care. Attention needs to be paid to the cost-effectiveness of the models and their sustainability, evaluation of their impact on patient outcomes by using comparators and the use of risk-stratification tools.

We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n=7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n=97 LFA+ individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titers during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titers, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 days. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.",Anja Garritsen; Anja Scholzen; Daan WA van den Nieuwenhof; Anke PF Smits; Esther Suzan Datema; Luc S van Galen; Milou LCE Kouwijzer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20187641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20187641,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
420,Serological Analysis Reveals an Imbalanced IgG Subclass Composition Associated with COVID-19 Disease Severity,"COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity, and the levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, including virus neutralizing titers. Through a serological analysis of serum samples from 536 convalescent healthcare workers, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels were indeed elevated in individuals that experienced severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody was dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. However, RBD- and S1-specific IgG1, rather than IgG3 were best correlated with virus-neutralizing titers. We propose that Spike-specific IgG3 subclass utilization contributes to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, and convalescent plasma therapy.",Jennifer L. Yates; Dylan J. Ehrbar; Danielle T. Hunt; Roxie Girardin; Alan P.

In Ethiopia, as of September 27, 2020, a total of 72,700 cases and 1165 deaths were reported.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the determinants of death in Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA case-control study of 147 Severe COVID-19 patients (49 deaths and 98 discharged alive cases) was conducted from August to September 2020. A comparison of underlying characteristics between cases (death) and controls (alive) was assessed using a chi-square test and an independent t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the predictor variables and outcome of Severe COVID-19 (Alive Vs Death) where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsHaving diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348, 7.867, p-value=0.00), fever (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027) and Shortness of breath (AOR= 4.034, 95% CI= 1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in Severe COVID-19 patients.

This cross-sectional study assessed 284 patients recruited from a tertiary hospital. Patients completed a web-based survey on socio-demographic data, past medical/psychiatric history, and additional information relevant to the outbreak conditions. The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Both the psychiatric morbidity and the protracted symptoms were independent of the initial infection severity. Further research on the neurobiological commonalities between the protracted symptoms and PTSD in COVID-19 patients is warranted.",Burc Cagri Poyraz; Cana Aksoy Poyraz; Yesim Olgun; Ozge Gurel; Sena Alkan; Yusuf Emre Ozdemir; Ilker Inanc Balkan; Ridvan Karaali,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208249,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208249,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
424,Detecting and isolating false negatives ofSARS-CoV-2 primers and probe sets among the Japanese Population: A laboratory testing methodology and study,"Objectives In this study, a comparative study between primers from Japan's and US's disease control centers was conducted. As further investigation, virus sequence alignment with primers' oligonucleotide was analyzed. Design or methods 11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for SARS-CoV-2 positive using recommended RT-PCR primer-probe sets from Japan National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results Of the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent results when tested simultaneously for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2. As a result, CDC recommended primer-probe sets showed relatively higher sensitivity and accuracy. Further virus sequence alignment analysis showed evidences for virus mutation happening at primer's binding sites. Conclusions The inconsistency in the RT-PCR results for JPN-N1, JPN-N2, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer-probe sets could be attributed to differences in virus mutation at primers' binding site as observed in sequence analysis. The use of JPN-N2 combined with CDC-N2 primer produces the most effective result to reduce false negatives in Japan region. In addition, adding CDC-N1 will also help to detect false negatives.",Wataru Tsutae; Wirawit Chaochaisit; Hideyuki Aoshima; Chiharu Ida; Shino Miyakawa; Hiroko Sekine; Iri Sato Baran; Toshiharu Furukawa; Akihiro Sekine,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208264,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208264,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
425,Reliability and limits of transport-ventilators to safely ventilate severe patients in special surge situations.,"BackgroundSeveral Intensive Care Units (ICU) have been overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19 patients thus necessitating to extend ventilation capacity outside the ICU where air and oxygen pressure are not always available. Transport ventilators requiring only O2 source may be used to deliver volume-controlled ventilation.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the performances of four transport ventilators compared to an ICU ventilator simulating severe respiratory conditions.

Materials and methodsTwo pneumatic transport ventilators, (Oxylog 3000, Draeger; Osiris 3, Air Liquide Medical Systems) and two turbine transport ventilators (Elisee 350, ResMed; Monnal T60, Air Liquide Medical Systems) were compared to an ICU ventilator (Engstrom Carestation - GE Healthcare) using a Michigan training test lung. We tested each ventilator with different set volumes Vtset (350, 450, 550 ml) and different compliances (20 or 50 ml/cmH2O) and a resistance of 15 cmH2 0/L/sec based on values recently described in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Volume error was measured, as well as the trigger time delay during assist-control ventilation simulating spontaneous breathing activity with a P0.1 of 4 cmH20.

ResultsGrouping all conditions, the volume error was 2.9 {+/-} 2.2 % for Engstrom Carestation; 3.6 {+/-} 3.9 % for Osiris 3; 2.5 {+/-} 2.1 % for Oxylog 3000; 5.4 {+/-} 2.7 % for Monnal T60 and 8.8 {+/-} 4.8 % for Elisee 350. Grouping all conditions, trigger delay was 42 {+/-} 4 ms, 65 {+/-} 5 ms, 151 {+/-} 14 ms, 51 {+/-} 6 and 64 {+/-} 5 ms for Engstrom Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350, respectively.

ConclusionsIn special surge situations such as COVID-19 pandemic, most transport ventilators may be used to safely deliver volume-controlled ventilation in locations where only oxygen pressure supply is available with acceptable volume accuracy.

426,Pulmonary Embolism in Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"BackgroundThere is an increasing evidence that COVID-19 could be complicated by coagulopathy which may lead to death; especially in severe cases. Hence, this study aimed to build concrete evidence regarding the incidence and mortality of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsWe performed a systematic search for trusted databases/search engines including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library and web of science. After screening, the relevant data were extracted and the incidences and mortality rates from the different included studies were pooled for meta-analysis.

ResultsTwenty studies were finally included in our study consisting of 1896 patients. The results of the meta-analysis for the all included studies showed that the incidence of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 17.6% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 12.7 to 22.5%. There was significant heterogeneity (I2{square}={square}91.17%). Additionally, the results of meta-analysis including 8 studies showed that the mortality in patients with both PE and COVID-19 was 43.1% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 19 to 67.1%. There was significant heterogeneity (I2{square}={square}86.96%).

ConclusionPE was highly frequent in patients with COVID-19. The mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and PE was remarkable representing almost half of the patients.

427,Isolation of infected people and their contacts is likely to be effective against many short-term epidemics,"BackgroundIsolation of infected people and their contacts may be an effective way to control outbreaks of infectious disease, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Models can provide insights into the efficacy of contact tracing, coupled with isolating or quarantining at risk people.

MethodsWe developed an agent-based model and simulated 15, 000 short term illnesses, with varying characteristics. For each illness we ran ten simulations on the following scenarios: (1) No tracing or isolation (None), (2) isolation of agents who have tested positive (Isolation), (3) scenario 2 coupled with minimal contact tracing and quarantine of contacts (Minimum), (4) scenario 3 with more effective contact tracing (Moderate), and (5) perfect isolation of agents who test positive and perfect tracing and quarantine of all their contacts (Maximum).

ResultsThe median total infections of the Isolation, Minimum, Moderate and Maximum scenarios were 80%, 40%, 17% and 4% of the no intervention scenario respectively.

ConclusionsIsolation of infected patients and quarantine of their contacts, even if moderately well implemented, is likely to substantially reduce the number of infections in an outbreak. Randomized controlled trials to confirm these results in the real world and to analyse the cost effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation during coronavirus and influenza outbreaks are warranted.",Nathan Geffen; Marcus O Low,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207845,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207845,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
428,High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France,"BackgroundA nationwide lockdown was implemented in France on 17 March 2020 to control the COVID-19 pandemic. People living in precarious conditions were relocated by the authorities to emergency shelters, hotels and large venues. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) then intervened to provide medical care in several of these locations in Paris and in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of its suburbs, between March and June 2020. A seroprevalence survey was conducted to assess the level of exposure to COVID-19 among the population living in the sites. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the impact of the pandemic on populations living in insecure conditions in Europe.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the food distribution sites, emergency shelters and workers residences supported by MSF in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, to determine the extent of COVID-19 exposure as determined by SARS-CoV2 antibody seropositivity. The detection of SARS-COV2 antibodies in serum was performed at the Institut Pasteur of Paris using two LuLISA (Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) assays and a Pseudo Neutralization Test. A questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, adherence to sanitary recommendations and symptom manifestations was also completed. We describe here the seroprevalence site by site and identify the risk factors for seropositivity using a multivariable logistic regression model with site random effects. We also investigated associations between seropositivity and symptoms eventually reported.

FindingsOverall, 426/818 individuals tested positive in the 14 sites investigated. Seroprevalence varied significantly with the type of site (chi2 p<0.001). It was highest at 88.7% (95%CI 81.8-93.2) among individuals living in workers residences, followed by 50.5% (95%CI 46.3-54.7) in emergency shelters and 27.8 % (95%CI 20.8-35.7) among individuals recruited from the food distribution sites. Seroprevalence also varied significantly between sites of the same type. Among other risk factors, the odds for seropositivity were higher among individuals living in crowded sites (medium: adj. OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.001; high: adj. OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.7-6.9, p<0.001) compared with individuals from low crowding sites and among those who reported transit accommodation in a gymnasium before the lockdown (adj. OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.2-8.1, p=0.023). More than two-thirds of the seropositive individuals (68.3%; 95%CI 64.2-72.2) did not report any symptoms during the recall period.

InterpretationThe results demonstrate rather high exposure to SARS-COV-2 with important variations between study sites. Living in crowded conditions was identified as the most important explanatory factor for differences in levels of exposure. This study describes the key factors which determine the risk of exposure and illustrates the importance of identifying populations at high risk of exposure in order to orient and adapt prevention and control strategies to their specific needs.",Thomas ROEDERER; Bastien MOLLO; Charline VINCENT; Birgit NIKOLAY; Augusto LLOSA; Robin NESBITT; Jessica VANHOMWEGEN; Thierry ROSE; Francois ANNA; Corinne TORRE; Emilie FOURREY; Sophie GOYARD; Yves JANIN; Pierre CHARNEAU; Oxana VRATSKIKH; Anneliese COURY; Stefan VANEL; Pierre MENDIHARAT; Klaudia PORTEN; William HENNEQUIN; Clair MILLS; Francisco LUQUERO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207795,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207795,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
429,AncestryDNA COVID-19 Host Genetic Study Identifies Three Novel Loci,"Human infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, leads to a remarkably diverse spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Recent reports suggest that both clinical and genetic risk factors may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To investigate genetic risk factors, we collected over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses between April and May 2020 with accompanying genetic data from the AncestryDNA database. We conducted sex-stratified and meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for COVID-19 susceptibility (positive nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) and severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). The severity GWAS replicated associations with severe COVID-19 near ABO and SLC6A20 (P<0.05). Furthermore, we identified three novel loci with P<5x10-8. The strongest association was near IVNS1ABP, a gene involved in influenza virus replication1, and was associated only in males. The other two novel loci harbor genes with established roles in viral replication or immunity: SRRM1 and the immunoglobulin lambda locus. We thus present new evidence that host genetic variation likely contributes to COVID-19 outcomes and demonstrate the value of large-scale, self-reported data as a mechanism to rapidly address a health crisis.",Genevieve H.L.

430,Modelling testing and response strategies for COVID-19 outbreaks in remote Australian Aboriginal communities,"BackgroundRemote Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have potential to be severely impacted by COVID-19, with multiple factors predisposing to increased transmission and disease severity. Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health responses.

MethodsAn individual-based simulation model represented communities ranging from 100 to 3,500 people, comprised of large interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding, quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent introduction of a case.

ResultsMultiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified. Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak infection prevalence from 60-70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission.

Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than 10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80-90%, however, or epidemic control will be lost.

ConclusionsA SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities. Prompt case detection with quarantining of extended-household contacts and a 14-day lockdown for all other residents, combined with exit testing for all, is the most effective strategy for rapid containment. Compliance is crucial, underscoring the need for community supported, culturally sensitive responses.",Ben B Hui; Damien Brown; Rebecca H Chisholm; Nicholas Geard; Jodie McVernon; David G Regan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208819,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208819,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
431,Report on COVID-19 Verification Case Study in Nine Countries Using the SIQR model,"This report uses the SIQR model proposed by Takashi Odagaki to examine the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in nine major countries during February-May 2020, and to clarify the peculiar trend of infection in Japan. The SIQR model, which is an improvement on the conventional SIR model, is unique in that it allows us to theoretically clarify the epidemic phenomenon by separating the number of daily confirmed new cases by testing and the number of infecteds at large who remain untested, and also allows us to theoretically consider measures to control the epidemic. The infection control measures of each country were analyzed by dividing them into three groups according to the size of the decay (or growth) rate of infected at large ({lambda}). The active group includes China and South Korea, the passive group includes the United States and Sweden, and the average group includes Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Japan. China and South Korea are the countries with the best testing and quarantine systems, and South Korea in particular having managed to contain the infection without lockdown through early quarantine by thorough testing. On the other hand, the United States and Sweden do not have a well-developed inspection and quarantine system and have shown little restraint in social distancing. In the case of Japan, the following special factors may have contributed to the extreme lack of PCR testing : (1) The ""4-day fever rule"" established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was strictly enforced. (2) Even after the decision to postpone the Olympics, the government continued to monopolize PCR testing for the sake of unified analysis of infection data, and the policy of expanding PCR testing by private companies was not implemented.",suda reiji,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208298,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208298,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
432,Cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes: a living systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVETo continually evaluate the rapidly evolving evidence base on the role of cardiovascular drugs in COVID-19 clinical outcomes (susceptibility to infection, hospitalization, hospitalization length, disease severity, and all-cause mortality).

DESIGNLiving systematic review and meta-analysis.

DATA SOURCESEligible publications identified from >500 databases indexed through 31st July 2020 and additional studies from reference lists, with planned continual surveillance for at least two years.

STUDY SELECTIONObservational and interventional studies that report on the association between cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

DATA EXTRACTIONSingle-reviewer extraction and quality evaluation (using ROBINS-I), with half the records independently extracted and evaluated by a second reviewer.

RESULTSOf 23,427 titles screened, 175 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The most reported drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACEI/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30). Among patients with COVID-19, unadjusted estimates showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with being hospitalized (OR 2.25, 1.70 to 2.98) and having severe disease (OR 1.50, 1.27 to 1.77) but not with the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.45, -1.33 to 0.43 days) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.25, CI 0.98 to 1.58). However, after adjustment, ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled adjusted OR 1.01, 0.93 to 1.10), being hospitalized (OR 1.16, 0.80 to 1.68), having severe disease (1.04, 0.76 to 1.42), or all-cause mortality (0.86, 0.64 to 1.15). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with being hospitalized (OR 0.84, 0.58 to 1.22), disease severity (OR 0.88, 0.68 to 1.14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.77, 0.54 to 1.12) while it decreased the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.71, -1.11 to -0.30 days). After adjusting for relevant covariates, other cardiovascular drug classes were mostly not found to be associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high level of heterogeneity in terms of effect sizes and a serious risk of bias, mainly due to confounding in the included studies.

CONCLUSIONOur comprehensive review shows that ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with COVID-19 outcomes such as susceptibility to infection, severity, and hospitalization in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, this association is not evident. Patients on cardiovascular drugs should continue taking their medications as currently recommended. Higher quality evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine any adverse or beneficial effects of cardiovascular drugs.

433,Role of high-dose exposure in transmission hot zones as a driver of SARS-CoV2 dynamics,"Epidemiological data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of various non-pharmaceutical interventions indicate that the virus is not transmitted uniformly in the population. Transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons, or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transmission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so called transmission hot zones, characterized by high dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. Interestingly, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high-dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. This gives rise to the prediction that targeted interventions that specifically reduce virus transmission in the hot zones (but not in the community at large) have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. The model can further reconcile seemingly contradicting epidemiological observations. While in some locations like California, strict stay-home orders failed to significantly reduce infection prevalence, in other locations, such as New York and several European countries, stay-home orders lead to a pronounced fall in infection levels, which remained suppressed for some months after re-opening of society. Differences in hot zone transmission levels during and after social distancing interventions can account for these diverging infection patterns. These modeling results warrant further epidemiological investigations into the role of high dose hot zone transmission for the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 spread.",Dominik Wodarz; Natalia L.

434,EFFECT OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA ON MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA,"BackgroundConvalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing antibodies, has been proposed for COVID-19, and preliminary evidence shows that it might have beneficial effect. Our objective was to compare epidemiological characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic.

MethodsThis is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program.

ResultsWe analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62{+/-}17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred.

Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor.

ConclusionsOur study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the hospital might be associated with decreased mortality.

Key PointsO_LIPreliminary evidence showed that convalescent plasma might be beneficial in COVID-19.

435,"COVID-19, Type-2 Diabetes, and Associated Health Outcomes in China: Results from a Nationwide Survey of 10,545 Adults","ObjectiveThis study examined the associations between type-2 diabetes (T2DM) and self-reported/familial COVID-19 infection and investigated health-related outcomes among those with diabetes during Chinas nationwide quarantine.

MethodsThe 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat) across China. It was completed by 10,545 adults in all of mainland Chinas 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables, adjusting for covariates.

ResultsDiabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among patients with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with T2DM tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting T2DM and 8.0% without T2DM). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with T2DM experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without T2DM. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate.

ConclusionsT2DM was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that the risk factors for initial infection and subsequent poor health outcomes include, but are not limited to, social vulnerability, economic status, older age, and obesity. While community-wide masking has been recommended by the World Health Organization to control COVID-19, its overall effectiveness has not been clearly evaluated.

Added value of this studyThrough an anonymous survey disseminated and promoted through WeChat, the largest social media platform in China, we sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the health, wellbeing, and health-related behaviors of adults in China. Specifically, this study examined how individuals with chronic diseases managed the threat, including their COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and adherence to preventive measures such as wearing face masks, and their disease-related self-care.

436,A high-throughput microfluidic nano-immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or ultra-low volume dried blood samples,"Novel technologies are needed to facilitate large-scale detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human blood samples. Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 L whole blood easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.",Zoe Swank; Grégoire Michielin; Hon Ming Yip; Patrick Cohen; Diego O.

437,Major role of IgM in the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2,"Characterization of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of Covid-19, is essential to help control the infection. In this regard, we and others recently reported that the neutralization activity of plasma from COVID-19 patients decreases rapidly during the first weeks after recovery. However, the specific role of each immunoglobulin isotype in the overall neutralizing capacity is still not well understood. In this study, we selected plasma from a cohort of Covid-19 convalescent patients and selectively depleted immunoglobulin A, M or G before testing the remaining neutralizing capacity of the depleted plasma. We found that depletion of immunoglobulin M was associated with the most substantial loss of virus neutralization, followed by immunoglobulin G. This observation may help design efficient antibody-based COVID-19 therapies and may also explain the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of autoimmune patients receiving therapies that impair the production of IgM.",Romain Gasser; Marc Cloutier; Jeremie Prevost; Corby Fink; Eric Ducas; Shilei Ding; Nathalie Dussault; Patricia Landry; Tony Tremblay; Audrey Laforce-Lavoie; Antoine Lewin; Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres; Annemarie Laumaea; Halima Medjahed; Catherine Larochelle; Jonathan Richard; Gregory A Dekaban; Jimmy D Dikeakos; Renee Bazin; Andres Finzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333278,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333278,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
438,Variant analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Middle East,"BackgroundCoronavirus (COVID-19) was introduced into society in late 2019 and has now reached over 26 million cases and 850,000 deaths. The Middle East has a death toll of [~]50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over 350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

MethodsThe approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).

FindingsWe identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East.

InterpretationThe phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants affecting in the region than any other study.

439,Batch-Corrected Distance Mitigates Temporal and Spatial Variability for Clustering and Visualization of Single-Cell Gene Expression Data,"Clustering and visualization are essential parts of single-cell gene expression data analysis. The Euclidean distance used in most distance-based methods is not optimal. Batch effect, i.e., the variability among samples gathered from different times, tissues, and patients, introduces large between-group distance and obscures the true identities of cells. To solve this problem, we introduce Batch-Corrected Distance (BCD), a metric using temporal/spatial locality of the batch effect to control for such factors. We validate BCD on a simulated data as well as applied it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset. We also found the utility of our approach in understanding the progression of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). BCD achieves more accurate clusters and better visualizations than state-of-the-art batch correction methods on longitudinal datasets. BCD can be directly integrated with most clustering and visualization methods to enable more scientific findings.",Shaoheng Liang; Jinzhuang Dou; Ramiz Iqbal; Ken Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.332080,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.332080,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False

441,Neutralizing antibodies from early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection offer cross-protection against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant.,"The emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a point mutation in the spike (S) protein, D614G, has taken precedence over the original Wuhan isolate by May 2020. With an increased infection and transmission rate, it is imperative to determine whether antibodies induced against the D614 isolate may cross-neutralize against the G614 variant. In this report, profiling of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity reveals similar neutralization profiles against both S protein variants, albeit waning neutralizing antibody capacity at the later phase of infection. These findings provide further insights towards the validity of current immune-based interventions.

IMPORTANCERandom mutations in the viral genome is a naturally occurring event that may lead to enhanced viral fitness and immunological resistance, while heavily impacting the validity of licensed therapeutics. A single point mutation from aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) at position 614 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, termed D614G, has garnered global attention due to the observed increase in transmissibility and infection rate. Given that a majority of the developing antibody-mediated therapies and serological assays are based on the S antigen of the original Wuhan reference sequence, it is crucial to determine if humoral immunity acquired from the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate is able to induce cross-detection and cross-protection against the novel prevailing D614G variant.",Cheryl Yi-Pin Lee; Siti Naqiah Amrun; Rhonda Sin-Ling Chee; Yun Shan Goh; Tze Minn Mak; Sophie Octavia; Nicholas Yeo; Zi Wei Chang; Matthew Zirui Tay; Anthony Torres; Guillaume Carissimo; Chek Meng Poh; Siew-Wai Fong; Bei Wang; Sandy Lee; Barnaby Young; Seow Yen Tan; Yee Sin Leo; David Chien Boon Lye; Raymond TP Lin; Sebastian Maurer-Stroh; Bernett T.

443,Forecasting COVID-19 cases at the Amazon region: a comparison of classical and machine learning models,"BACKGROUNDSince the first reports of COVID-19, decision-makers have been using traditional epidemiological models to predict the days to come. However, the enhancement of computational power, the demand for adaptable predictive frameworks, the short past of the disease, and uncertainties related to input data and prediction rules, also make other classical and machine learning techniques viable options.

OBJECTIVEThis study investigates the efficiency of six models in forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases with 17 days ahead. We compare the models autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN), random trees regressor (RTR), seasonal linear regression with change-points (Prophet), and simple logistic regression (SLR).

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe implement the models to data provided by the health surveillance secretary of Amapaa, a Brazilian state fully carved in the Amazon rainforest, which has been experiencing high infection rates. We evaluate the models according to their capacity to forecast in different historical scenarios of the COVID-19 progression, such as exponential increases, sudden decreases, and stability periods of daily cases. To do so, we use a rolling forward splitting approach for out-of-sample validation. We employ the metrics RMSE, R-squared, and sMAPE in evaluating the model in different cross-validation sections.

FINDINGSAll models outperform SLG, especially Holt-Winters, that performs satisfactorily in all scenarios. SVR and ARIMA have better performances in isolated scenarios. To implement the comparisons, we have created a web application, which is available online.

CONCLUSIONThis work represents an effort to assist the decision-makers of Amapa in future decisions to come, especially under scenarios of sudden variations in the number of confirmed cases of Amapa, which would be caused, for instance, by new contamination waves or vaccination. It is also an attempt to highlight alternative models that could be used in future epidemics.",Dalton  Garcia Borges de Souza; Francisco  Tarcísio Alves Júnior; Nei  Yoshihiro Soma,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332908,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332908,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
444,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces mixed M1/M2 phenotype in circulating monocytes and alterations in both dendritic cell and monocyte subsets,"Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection range from mild to critically severe. The aim of the study was to highlight the immunological events associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an emphasis on cells of innate immunity. Thirty COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate symptoms and 27 patients with severe/critically severe symptoms were recruited from the Clinical Center of Kragujevac during April 2020. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to reveal phenotypic and functional alterations of peripheral blood cells and to correlate them with the severity of the disease. In severe cases, the number of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and HLA-DR-expressing cells was drastically decreased. In the monocyte population proportion between certain subsets was disturbed and cells coexpressing markers of M1 and M2 monocytes were found in intermediate and non-classical subsets. In mild cases decline in lymphocyte number was less pronounced and innate immunity was preserved as indicated by an increased number of myeloid and activated dendritic cells, NK cells that expressed activation marker at the same level as in control and by low expression of M2 marker in monocyte population. In patients with severe disease, both innate and adoptive immunity are devastated, while in patients with mild symptoms decline in lymphocyte number is lesser, and the innate immunity is preserved.",Sanja Matic; Suzana Popovic; Predrag Djurdjevic; Danijela Todorovic; Natasa Djordjevic; Zeljko Mijailovic; Predrag Sazdanovic; Dragan Milovanovic; Dejana Ruzic Zecevic; Marina Petrovic; Maja Sazdanovic; Nenad Zornic; Vladimir Vukicevic; Ivana Petrovic; Snezana Matic; Marina Karic Vukicevic; Dejan Baskic,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332858,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332858,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
445,Age- and Sex-Specific Modelling of the COVID-19 Epidemic,"BackgroundRecent research points towards age- and sex-specific transmission of COVID-19 infections and their outcomes. The effect of sex, however, has been overlooked in past modelling approaches of COVID-19 infections.

AimThe aim of our study is to develop an age- and sex-specific model of COVID-19 transmission and to explore how contact changes effect COVID-19 infection and death rates.

MethodWe consider a compartment model to establish forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the compartments are subdivided into different age groups and genders. Estimated contact patterns, based on other studies, are incorporated to account for age- and sex-specific social behaviour. The model is fitted to real data and used for assessing hypothetical scenarios with regard to lockdown measures.

ResultsUnder current mitigation measures as of mid-August, active COVID-19 cases will double by the end of October 2020. Infection rates will be highest among the young and working ages, but will also rise among the old. Sex ratios reveal higher infection risks among women than men at working ages; the opposite holds true at old age. Death rates in all age groups are twice as high among men as women. Small changes in contact rates at working and young ages may have a considerable effect on infections and mortality at old age, with elderly men being always at higher risk of infection and mortality.

DiscussionOur results underline the high importance of the non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures in the current phase of the pandemic to prevent that an increase in contact rates leads to higher mortality among the elderly. Gender differences in contact rates, in addition to biological mechanisms related to the immune system, may contribute to sex-specific infection rates and their mortality outcome.

IntroductionMany healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced and may lack optimal organization and governance, especially concerning surgical health systems. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for the patients.

Inclusion criteriaThis review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in emergency trauma surgery.

MethodsWe will conduct several searches in the L{middle dot}OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Critical appraisal of the eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardized data extraction tool in Covidence. Studies will, when possible, be pooled in a statistical meta-analysis using JBI SUMARI.

447,System Dynamics Model of Possible Covid-19 Trajectories Under Various Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Options in Low Resource Setting.,"We present a population-based System Dynamics Model (SDM) of possible Covid-19 trajectories under various intervention options in the uniqueness of Kenya. We developed a stock and flow based SDM. We parametrized the SDM using published data and where data was not available, expert opinion was sought. Following validation test, the model was simulated to determined possible outcomes of non-pharmaceutical interventions in management of Covid-19. We simulate the possible impact of; social distancing, quarantining, curfew and cross-county travel restriction, lockdown of selected cities in Kenya and quarantining. We varied interventions in terms of start dates, duration of implementation and effectiveness of the interventions. We estimated the outcomes in terms of number of possible infections, recoveries and deaths. With the current state of interventions, we estimated a peak of Covid-19 in September 2020 with an estimated 13.5 Million Covid-19 cases and 33.8 thousand deaths in Kenya. The largest possible reduction in infections and mortality was achievable through increase in the effectiveness of the interventions. The suggested interventions would delay the epidemic peak of Covid-19 to between late Nov 2020 and early December 2020 with an estimated13M cases a 500 thousand reduction in Covid-19 cases and 32.4 deaths (a reduction in 1400 deaths).

Methodsthis prospective, observational, single-centre study included outpatients reviewed 12 weeks after an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation included data about the acute episode and epidemiological and clinical variables. The patients were classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the persistence or otherwise of symptoms. All the patients underwent a full blood test and serology for SARS-CoV-2, as well as imaging tests and spirometry if needed.

ResultsThe mean age of the 108 patients was 55.5 (SD: 15.4) years and 27.8% were health-care workers; 75.9% presented some type of symptoms, with dyspnoea being the most common. A D-dimer >500 ng/mL was detected in 32 (31.4%) patients. All the patients had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Being a health-care worker was associated with symptom persistence, with age [&ge;]65 years being a protective factor.

449,"Clinical, laboratory, and temporal predictors of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19","Background: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may protect from reinfection and disease, providing the rationale for administration of plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a treatment for COVID-19. The clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood. Methods: Adults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb. Results: Amongst 250 consecutive persons studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers [&ge;]1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.

450,"Real-World Effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin among hospitalized COVID-19 patients: Results of a target trial emulation using observational data from a nationwide Healthcare System in Peru","IntroductionPeru is one of the most impacted countries due to COVID-19. Given the authorized use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin (AZIT), and ivermectin (IVM), we aimed to evaluate their effectiveness alone or combined to reduce mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients without life-threatening illness.

MethodsRetrospective cohort emulating a target trial, using nationwide data of mid- and high-level hospitals from the Peruvian Social Health Insurance 01/April/2020-19/July/2020. Patients 18 yo and above with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and no life-threatening illness at admission were included. Five treatment groups (HCQ alone, IVM alone, AZIT alone, HCQ+AZIT, and IVM+AZIT within 48 hours of admission) were compared with standard of care alone. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate; secondary outcomes were all-cause death and/or ICU transfer, and all-cause death and/or oxygen prescription. Analyses were adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Propensity scores were estimated using machine learning boosting models. Weighted hazard ratios (wHR) were calculated using Cox regression.

ResultsAmong 5683 patients, 200 received HCT, 203 IVM, 1600 AZIT, 692 HCQ+AZIT, 358 IVM+AZIT, and 2630 standard of care. HCQ+AZIT was associated with 84% higher all-cause death hazard compared to standard care (wHR=1.84, 95%CI 1.12-3.02). Consistently, HCQ+AZIT was also associated with higher death and/or ICU transfer (wHR=1.49, 95%CI 1.01-2.19), and death and/or oxygen prescription (wHR=1.70, 95%CI 1.07-2.69). HCQ only showed higher death and/or oxygen prescription hazard. No effect was found for AZIT or IVM+AZIT.

ConclusionsOur study reported no beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin. The HCQ+AZIT treatment seems to increase risk for all-cause death.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19.

ResultsA total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2 patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants.

ResultsThe initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg/L after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg/L, which decreased to 43.82 mg/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P/F ratio (p<0.05), and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p<0.05).

ConclusionSteroids ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients.

453,Suicide and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis, but its effect on suicide deaths is little understood.

MethodWe analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and August 2020 and online surveys on mental health among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

ResultsCompared to the last three years (2017-2019), the number of suicide deaths was lower during the initial phase of the pandemic but subsequently exceeded the past trend. By August 2020, the total number of suicides was 7.72% higher than the average number of suicides in the same month of the previous three years. The largest increase was found in suicides by young women (less than 40 years of age), with a 63.1% increase in August 2020 compared to the same month in the past three years. The number of suicides among students and housekeepers in summer months was notably larger in 2020. The survey data indicated that the status of mental health among young women was worse than that of women in other age groups. In addition, young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss in recent months compared to any other groups, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding some of these young female workers.

ConclusionOur results strongly indicate that continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Michiko Ueda; Robert Nordström; Tetsuya Matsubayashi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207530,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207530,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True

455,Plasma ACE2 activity is persistently elevated following SARS-CoV-2 infection: implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis and consequences,"COVID-19 causes persistent endothelial inflammation, lung and cardiovascular complications. SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We reported downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma ACE2 activity. In this prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes and increased plasma ACE2 activity.

MethodsWe measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay in a cohort of Australians aged [&ge;]18 years (n=66) who had recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR testing) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples were available in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients.

ResultsPlasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days] was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in plasma ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive had higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (p<0.0001). We next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection. Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects, with no significant differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p>0.05).

DiscussionThis is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after COVID-19 infection, and the first with longitudinal data indicating plasma ACE2 activity remains elevated out to a median of 114 days post-infection. Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistent elevated plasma ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19.",Sheila K Patel; Jennifer A Juno; P Mark Hogarth; Wen Shi Lee; Stephen J Kent; Louise M Burrell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207514,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207514,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True
456,Mask mandates can limit COVID spread: Quantitative assessment of month-over-month effectiveness of governmental policies in reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases in 37 US States and the District of Columbia,"IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 is the beta-coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Facemask use has been qualitatively associated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but no study has quantitatively assessed the impact of government mask mandates (MM) on new COVID-19 cases across multiple US States.

Data and MethodsWe utilized a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm to test the a priori hypothesis that MM were associated with reductions in new COVID-19 cases. Publicly available data were used to analyze new COVID-19 cases from 37 States and the District of Columbia (i.e., ""38 States""). We conducted confirmatory All-States and State-Wise analyses, validity analyses [e.g., leave-one-out (LOO) and bootstrap resampling], and covariate analyses.

ResultsNo statistically significant difference in the daily number of new COVID-19 infections was discernable in the All-States analysis. In State-Wise LOO validity analysis, 11 States exhibited reductions in new COVID-19 and the reductions in four of these States (AK, MA, MN, VA) were significant in bootstrap resampling. Only the Social Capital Index predicted MM success (training p<0.028 and LOO p<0.013).

ConclusionResults obtained when studying the impact of MM on COVID-19 cases varies as a function of the heterogeneity of the sample being considered, providing clear evidence of Simpsons Paradox and thus of confounded findings. As such, studies of MM effectiveness should be conducted on disaggregated data. Since transmissions occur at the individual rather than at the collective level, additional work is needed to identify optimal social, psychological, environmental, and educational factors which will reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate MM effectiveness across diverse settings.",Michael J Maloney; Nathaniel James Rhodes; Paul R Yarnold,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208033,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208033,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True

This contribution aims to use tools of time series analysis for understanding processes of contagious through regions. I use VAR and Granger causality for testing neighbor spreading via sequential rate of contagion. Results show that in the case of Argentina, contagion began in the capital city of Buenos Aires and then spread to its hinterland via specific districts. Once interior districts were infected a positive feedback dynamics emerge creating regions of high reproducibility of the virus where interventions may be focus in the very near future.

458,Misinterpretation of viral load in COVID-19.,"Knowledge of viral load is essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. Moreover, patients identification with high viral load could also be useful to understand risk factors such as age, comorbidities, severity of symptoms and hypoxia to decide the need for hospitalization. Several studies are evaluating the importance of analyzing viral load in different types of samples, clinical outcomes and viral transmission pathways. However, in a great number of emerging studies cycle threshold (Ct) values by itself is often used as a viral load indicator, which may be a mistake. In this study, we compared tracheal aspirate with nasopharyngeal samples obtained from critically ill COVID-19 patients and demonstrate how the raw Ct could lead to misinterpretation of results. Further, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs positive samples and propose a method to reduce evaluation error that could occur from using raw Ct. Based on these findings, we show the impact that normalization of Ct values has on interpretation of viral load data from different biological samples from patients with COVID-19, transmission and lastly in relations with clinical outcomes.

ImportanceIn a pandemic, prevention of disease transmission is key. Reliable data for profiles of viral load are needed and important to guide antiviral treatment, infection control and vaccination. The differential expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA among patient groups is a current topic of interest and viral load has been associated with a diversity of outcomes. However, in a great number of emerging studies cycle threshold (Ct) values by itself is often used as a viral load indicator, which may be a mistake.

A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional sample of 30 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis, humoral and inflammatory responses. 132 distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitope responses across six different HLAs were detected, corresponding to 52 unique reactivities. T cell responses were directed against several structural and non-structural virus proteins. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response.

460,Preferential recognition and antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binding to 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is in immediate need of an effective antidote. Although the Spike glycoprotein (SgP) of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to heparins, the structural features of this interaction, the role of a plausible heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptor, and the antagonism of this pathway through small molecules remain unaddressed. Using an in vitro cellular assay, we demonstrate HSPGs modified by the 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform-3, but not isoform-5, preferentially increased SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in comparison to control, unmodified, wild-type HSPGs. Computational studies support preferential recognition of the receptor-binding domain of SgP by 3-O-sulfated HS sequences. Competition with either fondaparinux, a 3-O-sulfated HS-binding oligopeptide, or a synthetic, non-sugar small molecule, blocked SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Finally, the synthetic, sulfated molecule inhibited fusion of GFP-tagged pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with human 293T cells with sub-micromolar potency. Overall, overexpression of 3-O-sulfated HSPGs contribute to fusion of SARS-CoV-2, which could be effectively antagonized by a synthetic, small molecule.",Vaibhav Tiwari; Ritesh Tandon; Nehru Viji Sankaranarayanan; Jacob C Beer; Ellen K Kohlmeir; Michelle Swanson-Mungerson; Umesh R.

461,Genome-scale identification of SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus host factor networks,"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than one million people worldwide. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which are viruses that cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses. This human Coronaviridae host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus spillover events.

However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. In this study, we developed simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and fourplex (4 targets) assays based on a two color ddPCR system for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results showed that the fourplex assay had the similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical isolates demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug couldnt.

One of the primary benefits of face masks and other coverings is as source control devices to reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols during coughing, breathing, and speaking. Face shields have been proposed as an alternative to face masks, but information about face shields as source control devices is limited. We used a cough aerosol simulator with a headform to propel small aerosol particles (0 to 7 {micro}m) into different face coverings. An N95 respirator blocked 99% of the cough aerosol, a procedure mask blocked 59%, a 3-ply cloth face mask blocked 51%, and a polyester neck gaiter blocked 47% as a single layer and 60% when folded into a double layer.

465,Contact tracing and isolation reduces Covid-19 incidence in a structured agent-based model,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe World Health Organization has identified contact tracing and isolation (CTI) as a key strategy to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Structured agent-based models (ABMs) provide a means to investigate the efficacy of such strategies in heterogeneous populations and to explore the impact of factors such as changes in test turnaround times (TaT).

MethodsWe developed a structured ABM to simulate key SARS-CoV-2 transmission and Covid-19 disease progression dynamics in populations of 10, 000 agents. We ran 10, 000 simulations of each of three scenarios: (1) No CTI with a TaT of two days, (2) CTI with a TaT of two days, and (3) CTI with a TaT of eight days. We conducted a secondary analysis in which TaT values were varied from two to 11. The primary outcome for all analyses was mean total infections.

ResultsCTI reduced the mean number of infections from 5, 577 to 4, 157 (a relative reduction of 25.5%) when TaT was held steady at two days. CTI with a TaT of eight days resulted in a mean of 5, 163 infections (a relative reduction of 7.4% compared to no CTI and a TaT of two days). In the secondary analysis, every additional day added to the TaT increased the total number of infections - with the greatest increase in infections between four and five days, and the smallest increase between ten and 11 days.

ConclusionsIn a structured ABM that simulates key dynamics of Covid-19 transmission and disease progression, CTI results in a substantial reduction in the mean number of total infections. The benefit is greater with shorter TaT times, but remained substantial even with TaTs of eight days. The results suggest that CTI may play a critical role in reducing the size of outbreaks and that TaTs should be kept as short as possible in order to maximise this benefit.",Marcus O Low; Nathan Geffen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207761,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207761,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True

Phylogenetic analysis identified 8 global lineages and at least 76 independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Kenyan coast. The dominant B.1 lineage (European origin) accounted for 82.1% of the cases. Lineages A, B and B.4 were detected from screened individuals at the Kenya-Tanzania border or returning travellers but did not lead to established transmission. Though multiple lineages were introduced in coastal Kenya within three months following the initial confirmed case, none showed extensive local expansion other than cases characterised by lineage B.1, which accounted for 45 of the 76 introductions. We conclude that the international points of entry were important conduits of SARS-CoV-2 importations.

467,Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.,"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic is likely to lead to a significant increase in mental health disorders amongst healthcare workers (HCW).

AimsWe evaluated the prevalence of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a HCW population in the United Kingdom (UK), to identify subgroups most at risk.

MethodsAn electronic survey was conducted between the 05/06/2020 and 31/07/2020 of all hospital HCW in the West Midlands, UK using clinically validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations.

ResultsThere were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female: 79.5%, median age: 42 [IQR: 32-51] years). The prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were 34.3%, 31.2% and 24.5% respectively. In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.9-2.7]; p<0.001), depression (2.5 [2.1-3.0]; p<0.001) and PTSD (2.1 [1.7-2.5]; p<0.001). The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), wellbeing support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with former symptoms (p[&le;]0.001).

ConclusionsWe report a high prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD in hospital HCW following the initial Covid-19 pandemic peak in the UK. Those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk. Adequate PPE availability, access to wellbeing support and reduced exposure to moral dilemmas may protect hospital HCW from mental health symptoms.",Kasun Wanigasooriya; Priyanka Palimar; David Naumann; Khalida Ismail; Jodie L.

468,Psychiatric side effects induced by chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: a systematic review of case reports and population studies,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are commonly used drugs in the treatment of malaria as well as chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although various reports on possible psychiatric side effects of these drugs exist, the nature and extent of these effects remain poorly understood. Moreover, the relevance of these drugs in the treatment of early stages of COVID-19 necessitates a careful estimation of their side effects. Here, we provide a systematic review of the psychiatric side effects associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to identify relevant literature published between 1962 and 2020. Search terms included chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, psychiatry, psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, delirium, and psychotic disorders. Only case reports and clinical trials were included. All studies included records of psychiatric side effects induced by either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or both. Both retrospective and prospective, randomized as well as non-randomized population studies were included. Overall, the psychiatric side effects are dose- and sex-independent. The most common psychiatric side effects reported are increased speech output/ excessive talking, increased psychomotor activity, irritable mood, auditory hallucinations, delusion of grandiosity, and suicide attempts, likely due to brain intoxicationbe of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.

469,A potential impact of physical distancing on physical and mental health. A rapid narrative umbrella review of meta-analyses on the link between social isolation and health,"BackgroundThe imperative for physical distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may deteriorate physical and mental health. We aimed at summarizing the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of social isolation and loneliness with physical and mental health.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone, and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social isolation and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarized in a narrative synthesis.

ResultsTwenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. A total of more than 3 million individuals had participated in the 692 primary studies. The results suggest that social isolation is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life, and suicidal ideation.

ConclusionsThe existing evidence clearly indicates that social isolation is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.

470,Business Shutdowns and COVID-19 Mortality,"Governments around the world have adopted unprecedented policies to deal with COVID-19. This paper zooms in on business shutdowns and investigates their effectiveness in reducing mortality. We leverage upon highly granular death registry data for over 4,000 Italian municipalities in a diff-in-diff approach that allows us to credibly mitigate endogeneity concerns. Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that business shutdowns are very effective in reducing mortality. We calculate that the death toll from the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy would have been twice as high in their absence. Our findings also highlight that timeliness is key - by acting one week earlier, the government could have reduced the death toll by an additional 25%. Finally, our estimates suggest that shutdowns should be targeted: closing shops, bars and restaurants saves the most lives, while shutting down manufacturing and construction activities has only mild effects.",Gabriele Ciminelli; Silvia Garcia-Mandico,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207910,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207910,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
471,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using pooling of self-collected samples: Simple protocols may foster asymptomatic surveillance,"1BackgroundSurveillance of COVID infection and isolation of infected individuals is one of the available tools to control the spread of SAR-CoV-2. Asymptomatic and pre symptomatic are responsible for substantial transmission. RNA or antigen tests are necessary to identify non-symptomatic individuals. We tested the feasibility of using samples pooling offering different collection alternatives (swab/throat wash/saliva) to volunteers of a public health institute.

MethodsWe evaluated pool samples from frozen material from previously tested samples and a prospective collection from asymptomatic volunteers. Some collections were paired for comparison. Pools and some individual samples were extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and/or Lucigen Quick Extract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch, USA) and submitted to rtPCR (Allplex, Seegene, Korea).

ResultsA total of 240 samples from 130 new collections and 37 samples with known result were evaluated. Pool CT was generally higher than individual samples. Lucigen extraction showed higher CT, including false negative results for samples with high CT at Qiagen extraction. Paired Swab and TW samples showed comparable results. No volunteer from negative pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after collection.

ConclusionsClinical samples pooling to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is feasible and an economical way to test for COVID-19, especially in surveillance strategies targeting more infectiousness, higher viremia individuals. The use of Lucigen reagents show lower sensibility that may lead to false negative results with lower viremia samples. Combining throat wash with saliva may provide and interesting self-collection alternative, but more comparative work is needed.",Giselle Ibette Silva Lopez Lopes; Rita de Cassia Compagnoli Carmona; Valeria Oliveira Silva; Cintia Mayumi Ahagon; Lincoln Spinazola do Prado; Fabiana Cristina Pereira dos Santos; Daniela Bernardes Borges da Silva; Wiliam Nery Ribeiro; Elaine Monteiro Matshuda; Auldrey Cilli; Ana Maria Sardinha Afonso; Margarete Aparecida Benaga Pinho; Maria do Carmo Sampaio Tavare Timnetsky; Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20205872,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20205872,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
472,"Antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in adults from the Vancouver metropolitan area, Canada","BackgroundQuantifying antibody reactivity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens may help understand individual differences in COVID-19 severity at the population level.

MethodsCross-sectional study that included adults in the Vancouver area in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between May 17 and June 19, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was ascertained by measuring total SARS-CoV-2 IgG/M/A against a recombinant spike (S1) protein and adjusted for bias due to false-positive and false-negative test results. A novel, high sensitivity multiplex assay was also used to profile IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV and four circulating coronaviruses.

FindingsAmong 276 participants (71% of health workers, HCW), three showed evidence of direct viral exposure, yielding an adjusted seroprevalence of 0.60% [95%CI 0% - 2.71%], with no difference between HCW and non-HCW, or between pediatric and adult HCW. Among the 273 unexposed individuals, 7.3% [95%CI 4.5% - 11.1%], 48.7 [95%CI 42.7% - 54.8%] and 82.4% [95%CI 77.4% - 86.7%] showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, N or Spike, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 reactivity did not significantly correlate with age, sex, did not significantly differ between HCW and non-HCW (prevalence 1.0% vs 1.0%; P=1.00) and between pediatric and adult HCW (0.7% vs 1.6%; P=0.54), and modestly correlated with reactivity to circulating coronaviruses (Spearman rho range: 0.130 to 0.224 for 7 significant [FDR 5%], out of 16 of 36 correlations tested).

InterpretationAll individuals in this population displayed high antibody levels against common, circulating coronaviruses, and a substantial proportion of them showed low, but detectable antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens despite no evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

473,The potential impact of intervention strategies on COVID-19 transmission in Malawi: A mathematical modelling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings such as Malawi due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we estimate the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity.

MethodsThe infection fatality ratios (IFR) in Malawi were estimated by adjusting reported IFR for China accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions. The impact of a novel therapeutic agent and increases in hospital capacity and oxygen availability were explored, given different assumptions on mortality rates.

FindingsThe estimated age-specific IFR in Malawi are higher than those reported for China, however the younger average age of the population results in a slightly lower population-weighted IFR (0.48%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.30% - 0.72% compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% - 1.3% in China). The current interventions implemented, (i.e. social distancing, workplace closures and public transport restrictions) could potentially avert 3,100 deaths (95% UI 1,500 - 4,500) over the course of the epidemic. Enhanced shielding of people aged [&ge;] 60 years could avert a further 30,500 deaths (95% UI 17,500 - 45,600) and halve ICU admissions at the peak of the outbreak. Coverage of face coverings of 60% under the assumption of 50% efficacy could be sufficient to control the epidemic. A novel therapeutic agent, which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity could reduce projected mortality to 2.55 deaths per 1,000 population (95% UI 1.58 - 3.84).

ConclusionThe risks due to COVID-19 vary across settings and are influenced by age, underlying health and health system capacity.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIAs COVID-19 spreads throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, countries are under increasing pressure to protect the most vulnerable by suppressing spread through, for example, stringent social distancing measures or shielding of those at highest risk away from the general population.
C_LIO_LIThere are a number of studies estimating infection fatality ratio due to COVID-19 but none use data from African settings. The estimated IFR varies across settings ranging between 0.28-0.99%, with higher values estimated for Europe (0.77%, 95% CI 0.55 - 0.99%) compared with Asia (0.46%, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.55).
C_LIO_LIThe IFR for African settings are still unknown, although several studies have highlighted the potential for increased mortality due to comorbidities such as HIV, TB and malaria.
C_LIO_LIThere are a small number of studies looking at the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Africa, particularly South Africa, but none to date have combined this with country-specific estimates of IFR adjusted for comorbidity prevalence and with consideration to the prevailing health system constraints and the impact of these constraints on mortality rates.

Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation may inform policies and programs to prevent suicide.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignWe compared suicidal ideation in 2017-2018 to suicidal ideation in 2020. We estimated the association between stressors and suicidal ideation in bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsParticipants were from two, nationally representative surveys of US adults: The 2017-2017 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (conducted March 31 to April 13), analyzed April 28 to September 30, 2020.

ExposuresEconomic precarity as measured through job loss or difficulty paying rent and social isolation based on reporting ""feeling alone.""

Main outcome measureSuicidal ideation based on reporting ""Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way"" over the past two weeks.

ResultsSuicidal ideation increased more than fourfold, from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), while losing a job was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Feeling alone was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.4).

475,Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and social distancing: A cross-sectional study,"Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, a controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic within the period of June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = 0.017) with individuals perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = 0.032) and education level (P < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted  knowledge about social distancing. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < 0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the  perception of COVID-19 origin and  the perception and knowledge about social distancing.",Lenisse M.

476,MAJORA: Continuous integration supporting decentralised sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance,"Genomic epidemiology has become an increasingly common tool for epidemic response. Recent technological advances have made it possible to sequence genomes rapidly enough to inform outbreak response, and cheaply enough to justify dense sampling of even large epidemics. With increased availability of sequencing it is possible for agile networks of sequencing facilities to collaborate on the sequencing and analysis of epidemic genomic data.

In response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium was formed with the aim of rapidly sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes as part of a national-scale genomic surveillance strategy. The network consists of universities, academic institutes, regional sequencing centres and the four UK Public Health Agencies.

We describe the development and deployment of Majora, an encompassing digital infrastructure to address the challenge of collecting and integrating both genomic sequencing data and sample-associated metadata produced across the COG-UK network. The system was designed and implemented pragmatically to stand up capacity rapidly in a pandemic caused by a novel virus.

477,Production of ORF8 protein from SARS-CoV-2 using an inducible virus-mediated expression-system in suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spread worldwide in 2019, is an urgent problem to be overcome. The ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to be associated with the symptoms of COVID-19, according to reports of clinical studies. However, little is known about the function of ORF8. As one of the ways to advance the functional analysis of ORF8, mass production of ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure is necessary. In this study, we attempted to produce ORF8 protein by chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells. An ORF8-producing line was generated by the Agrobacterium method. As a result, the production of ORF8 of 8.8 {+/-} 1.4 mg/L of culture medium was confirmed. SDS-PAGE and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis confirmed that the ORF8 produced by this system is a dimeric form with a three-dimensional structure, unlike that produced in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was suggested that the ORF8 produced by this system was N-glycosylated. Through this study, we succeeded in producing ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure in a chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY2 cells. It is expected that the functional analysis of ORF8 will be advanced using the ORF8 produced by this system and that it will greatly contribute to the development of vaccines and antibodies against ORF8.",Tomohiro Imamura; Noriyoshi Isozumi; Yasuki Higashimura; Shinya Ohki; Masashi Mori,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.325910,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.325910,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False

By single cell sorting 4277 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific memory B cells from 14 Covid-19 survivors, 453 neutralizing antibodies were identified and 220 of them were expressed as IgG. Up to 65,9% of monoclonals neutralized the wild type virus at a concentration of >500 ng/mL, 23,6% neutralized the virus in the range of 100 - 500 ng/mL and 9,1% had a neutralization potency in the range of 10 - 100 ng/mL. Only 1,4% neutralized the authentic virus with a potency of 1-10 ng/mL. We found that the most potent neutralizing antibodies are extremely rare and recognize the RBD, followed in potency by antibodies that recognize the S1 domain, the S-protein trimeric structure and the S2 subunit. The three most potent monoclonal antibodies identified were able to neutralize the wild type and D614G mutant viruses with less than 10 ng/mL and are good candidates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic tools against SARS-CoV-2.

479,"SARS-CoV-2 has observably higher propensity to accept uracil as nucleotide substitution: Prevalence of amino acid substitutions and their predicted functional implications in circulating SARS-CoV-2 in India up to July, 2020","SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as pandemic all over the world since late 2019. In this study, we investigated the diversity of the virus in the context of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. Full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of the circulating viruses from all over India were collected from GISAID, an open data repository, until 25thJuly, 2020. We have focused on the non-synonymous changes across the genome that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Analysis of the genomic signatures of the non-synonymous mutations demonstrated a strong association between the time of sample collection and the accumulation of genetic diversity. Most of these isolates from India belonged to the A2a clade (63.4%) which has overcome the selective pressure and is spreading rapidly across several continents. Interestingly a new clade I/A3i has emerged as the second-highest prevalent type among the Indian isolates, comprising 25.5% of the Indian sequences. Emergence of new mutations in the S protein was observed. Major SARS-CoV-2 clades in India have defining mutations in the RdRp. Maximum accumulation of mutations was observed in ORF1a.

Other than the clade-defining mutations, few representative non-synonymous mutations were checked against the available crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the DynaMut server to assess their thermodynamic stability. We have observed that SARS-CoV-2 genomes contain more uracil than any other nucleotide. Furthermore, substitution of nucleotides to uracil was highest among the non-synonymous mutations observed. The A+U content in SARS-CoV-2 genome is much higher compared to other RNA viruses, suggesting that the virus RdRp has a propensity towards uracil incorporation in the genome. This implies that thymidine analogues may have a better chance to competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication than other nucleotide analogues.",Subrata Roy; Himadri Nath; Abinash Mallick; Subhajit Biswas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.329771,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.329771,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
480,Making the invisible enemy visible,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, structural biologists have rushed to solve the structures of the 28 proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome in order to understand the viral life cycle and enable structure-based drug design.

These structural models serve as basis for research worldwide to understand how the virus hijacks human cells, for structure-based drug design and to aid in the development of vaccines. However, errors often occur in even the most careful structure determination - and are even more common among these structures, which were solved under immense pressure.

481,Mass spectrometric based detection of protein nucleotidylation in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2, encode a nucleotidyl transferase in the N-terminal NiRAN domain of the non-structural protein (nsp) 12 protein within the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 1-3. Though the substrate targets of the viral nucleotidyl transferase are unknown, NiRAN active sites are highly conserved and essential for viral replication 3. We show, for the first time, the detection and sequence location of GMP-modified amino acids in nidovirus RdRP-associated proteins using heavy isotope-assisted MS and MS/MS peptide sequencing. We identified lys-143 in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein, nsp7, as a primary site of nucleotidylation in vitro that uses a phosphoramide bond to covalently attach with GMP. In SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins, we demonstrate a unique O-linked GMP attachment on nsp7 ser-1, whose formation required the presence of nsp12. It is clear that additional nucleotidylation sites remain undiscovered, which includes the possibility that nsp12 itself may form a transient GMP adduct in the NiRAN active site that has eluted detection in these initial studies due to instability of the covalent attachment. Our results demonstrate new strategies for detecting GMP-peptide linkages that can be adapted for higher throughput screening using mass spectrometric technologies. These data are expected to be important for a rapid and timely characterization of a new enzymatic activity in SARS-CoV-2 that may be an attractive drug target aimed at limiting viral replication in infected patients.",Michael R Sussman; Brian J Conti; Robert N Kirchdoerfer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330324,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330324,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
482,NSP 11 of SARS-CoV-2 is an Intrinsically Disordered Protein,"The intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDPRs) are known to be responsible for multiple cellular processes and are associated with many chronic diseases. In viruses, the existence of disordered proteome is also proven and are related with its conformational dynamics inside the host. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a large proteome, in which, structure and functions of many proteins are not known as of yet. Previously, we have investigated the dark proteome of SARS-CoV-2. However, the disorder status of non-structural protein 11 (nsp11) was not possible because of very small in size, just 13 amino acid long, and for most of the IDP predictors, the protein size should be at least 30 amino acid long. Also, the structural dynamics and function status of nsp11 was not known. Hence, we have performed extensive experimentation on nsp11. Our results, based on the Circular dichroism spectroscopy gives characteristic disordered spectrum for IDPs. Further, we investigated the conformational behaviour of nsp11 in the presence of membrane mimetic environment, alpha helix inducer, and natural osmolyte. In the presence of negatively charged and neutral liposomes, nsp11 remains disordered. However, with SDS micelle, it adopted an -helical conformation, suggesting the helical propensity of nsp11. At the end, we again confirmed the IDP behaviour of nsp11 using molecular dynamics simulations.",Kundlik Gadhave; Prateek Kumar; Ankur Kumar; Taniya Bhardwaj; Neha Garg; Rajanish Giri,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330068,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330068,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
483,Umbilical cord blood derived microglia-like cells to model COVID-19 exposure,"Microglia, the resident brain immune cells, play a critical role in normal brain development, and are impacted by the intrauterine environment, including maternal immune activation and inflammatory exposures. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.",Roy H.

484,An open-label prospective observational study of antiandrogen and non-antiandrogen early pharmacological approaches in females with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The Pre-AndroCoV Female Trial.,"BackgroundWhile COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.

Materials and methodsFemales with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression.

ResultsIn total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 {+/-} 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 {+/-} 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 {+/-} 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), headache (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), dry cough (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), myalgia (1.2 {+/-} 0.4), nauseas (1.3 {+/-} 0.5) and weakness (1.3 {+/-} 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication.

ConclusionsA sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes.

485,WORLDWIDE CASE FATALITY RATIO OF COVID-19 OVER TIME,"BackgroundThe case fatality ratio (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to be variable among different countries and regions but few analyses have tracked this ratio worldwide over time.

MethodsThe primary objective was to assess the time-course evolution of CFR of COVID-19 in all countries with available data and secondary objective was to evaluate associations between country-wise CFR and country-level health, human development, demographic and economic parameters. Day-wise data of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country was extracted from a public repository and countries with at least 1000 cases on cutoff date were clustered by unsupervised k-means on the basis of deaths per 100000 population (DP100K). Day-wise CFR (cumulative deaths divided by cumulative cases, multiplied by 100) for each country and cluster (country group) was plotted as time-series and country-level parameters were tested for association with CFR using weighted multiple linear regression.

ResultsOn September 24, 2020 there were 32140504 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 981792 deaths reported from 184 countries for a worldwide CFR of 3.06 % (95%CI 3.05 -3.07). Unsupervised k-means clustering in 157 countries with at least 1000 reported cases resulted in Clusters (country groups) A, B, C, D and E with centroid DP100K and CFR of 0.100 and 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 0.503 and 2.28 (95% CI 2.23-2.33), 1.816 and 1.73 (95% CI 1.71-1.75), 7.395 and 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76), and 36.303 and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively. In a log-log analysis DP100K and CFR were significantly positively correlated (R=0.3570, p<0.001) with each other. All country groups and majority of included countries showed a pattern of gradually increasing CFR from the beginning of pandemic, followed by a plateau and then a steady decline in CFR. Among 10 country-level parameters, GDP per capita ({beta}=-0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population ({beta}=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality from air pollution ({beta}=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density ({beta}=-0.570, p< 0.000) were significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio ({beta}=0.431, p=0.000) and age ({beta}=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR.

ConclusionsThe CFR of COVID-19 has gradually increased over time in majority of countries at various stages of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and a steady decline. Population level COVID-19 mortality burden and CFR are significantly positively associated with each other.",Rohan Chaubal; Sadhana Kannan; Navin Khattry; Sudeep Gupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206599,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206599,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
486,"Markers Of Coagulation And Hemostatic Activation Identify COVID-19 Patients At High Risk For Thrombotic Events, ICU Admission and Intubation","BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a coagulopathy giving rise to venous and arterial thrombotic events. The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications.

MethodsCOVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as [&ge;] 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission and those who were pregnant.

ResultsOf 276 patients (mean age 59 {+/-} 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race) who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer [&ge;] 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer [&ge;]2000 ng/mL and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint.

ConclusionsAdmission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events. Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients.",Darwish Alabyad; Srikant Rangaraju; Michael Liu; Rajeel Imran; Christine Kempton; Milad Sharifpour; Sara Auld; Manila Gaddh; Roman Sniecinski; Cheryl L Maier; Jeannette Guarner; Alexander Duncan; Fadi Nahab,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206540,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206540,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
487,A haemagglutination test for rapid detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of seroconversion in populations, detection of seroconversion after vaccination, and for seeking evidence for a level of antibody that may be protective against COVID-19 disease. Several high-performance commercial tests have been described, but these require centralised laboratory facilities that are comparatively expensive, and therefore not available universally. Red cell agglutination tests have a long history in blood typing, and general serology through linkage of reporter molecules to the red cell surface. They do not require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied as a Point of Care Test (POCT). We describe a red cell agglutination test for the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We show that the Haemagglutination Test (""HAT"") has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a PCR diagnosed infection. The HAT can be titrated, detects rising titres in the first five days of hospital admission, correlates well with a commercial test that detects antibodies to the RBD, and can be applied as a point of care test. The developing reagent is composed of a previously described nanobody to a conserved glycophorin A epitope on red cells, linked to the RBD from SARS-CoV-2. It can be lyophilised for ease of shipping. We have scaled up production of this reagent to one gram, which is sufficient for ten million tests, at a cost of [~]0.27 UK pence per test well. Aliquots of this reagent are ready to be supplied to qualified groups anywhere in the world that need to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but do not have the facilities for high throughput commercial tests.",Alain Townsend; Pramila Rijal; Julie Xiao; Tiong Kit Tan; Kuan-Ying A Huang; Lisa Schimanski; Jiangdong Ho; Nimesh Gupta; Rolle Rahikainen; Philippa C Matthews; Derrick Crook; Sarah Hoosdally; Teresa Street; Justine Rudkin; Nicole Stoesser; Fredrik Karpe; Matthew Neville; Rutger Ploeg; Marta Oliveira; David J Roberts; Abigail A Lamikanra; Hoi Pat Tsang; Abbie Bown; Richard Vipond; Alexander J Mentzer; Julian C Knight; Andrew Kwok; Gavin Screaton; Juthathip Mongkolsapaya; Wanwisa Dejnirattisai; Piyada Supasa; Paul Klenerman; Christina Dold; Kenneth Baillie; Shona C Moore; Peter JM Openshaw; Malcolm G Semple; Lance CW Turtle; Mark Ainsworth; Alice Allcock; Sally Beer; Sagida Bibi; Elizabeth Clutterbuck; Alexis Espinosa; Maria Mendoza; Dominique Georgiou; Teresa Lockett; Jose Martinez; Elena Perez; Veronica Sanchez; Giuseppe Scozzafava; Alberto Sobrinodiaz; Hannah Thraves; Etienne Joly,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205831,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205831,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
488,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Management of Heart Failure -A United Kingdom Patient Questionnaire Study,"AimThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges to healthcare globally, necessitating rapid restructuring of service provision. This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services.

Methods and ResultsThe survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF), a UK HF patient charity. ""Survey Monkey"" was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the PMFs online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (out-patient hospital and community HF clinics). 1050 responses were collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID19 (mean 7{+/-}2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared to anxiety regarding HF (6.1{+/-}2.4; p<0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged [&le;]60 years about HF (6.3{+/-}2.2 versus 5.9{+/-}2.5 in those aged >60 years; p=0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3{+/-}2.3 versus 6.7{+/-}2.6 those aged >60 years; p<0.001). 65% respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period. 37% reported disruption to medication prescription services and 34% reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. 32% expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all).

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients regarding COVID-19 and HF. Cancellation or postponement of scheduled clinic appointments, investigations, procedures, prescription and monitoring services were implicated as sources of anxiety.",Rajiv Sankaranarayanan; Nick Hartshorne-Evans; Sam Redmond-Lyon; Jill Wilson; Hani Essa; Alastair Gray; Louise Clayton; Carys Barton; Fozia Z Ahmed; Colin Cunnington; Duwarakan Satchithananda; Clare Murphy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205328,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205328,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
489,"The relationship between neighborhood poverty and COVID-19 mortality within racial/ethnic groups (Cook County, Illinois)","AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPrior research has identified higher rates of COVID-19 mortality among people of color (relative to non-Hispanic whites) and populations in high-poverty neighborhoods (relative to wealthier neighborhoods). It is unclear, however, whether non-Hispanic whites in high-poverty neighborhoods experience elevated mortality, or whether people of color living in wealthy areas are relatively protected. Exploring socioeconomic position in combination with race/ethnicity can lead to a more detailed understanding of the specific processes that result in COVID-19 inequities.

Methods and FindingsWe used census and individual-level mortality data for the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic/Latinx populations of Cook County, Illinois, USA. We excluded deaths related to nursing homes and other institutions. We calculated age and gender-adjusted mortality rates by race/ethnicity, census tract poverty quartile, and age group (0-64 and [&ge;]65 years).

Within all racial/ethnic groups, COVID-19 mortality rates were greatest in the highest-poverty quartile and lowest in the lowest-poverty quartile. The mortality rate for younger non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was 13.5 times that of younger non-Hispanic whites in the lowest-poverty quartile (95% CI: 8.5, 21.4). For young people in the highest-poverty quartile, the non-Hispanic white and Black mortality rates were similar. Among younger people in the lowest-poverty quartile, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx people had mortality rates nearly three times that of non-Hispanic whites. For the older population, the mortality rate among non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was less than that of lowest-poverty non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are partly, but not entirely, attributable to the higher average socioeconomic position of non-Hispanic whites relative to the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. Future research on health equity in COVID-19 outcomes should collect and analyze individual-level data on the potential mechanisms driving population distributions of exposure, severe illness, and death.",Justin M Feldman; Mary T Bassett,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206318,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206318,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
490,"Strategies for infection control and prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 4,554 employees of a university hospital in Munich, Germany","BackgroundHospital staff are at high risk of infection during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We analysed the exposure characteristics, efficacy of protective measures, and transmission dynamics in this hospital-wide prospective seroprevalence study.

Methods and FindingsOverall, 4554 individuals were tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Individual risk factors, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), occupational exposure, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and correlated to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres and PCR testing results. Odds ratios with corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate associations between individual factors and seropositivity. Spatio-temporal trajectories of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and staff mobility within the hospital were visualised to identify local hotspots of virus transmission.

The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody was 2.4% [95% CI 1.9-2.9]. Patient-facing staff, including those working in COVID-19 areas, had a similar probability of being seropositive as non-patient-facing staff. Prior interaction with SARS-CoV-2-infected co-workers or private contacts and unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients increased the probability of seropositivity. Loss of smell and taste had the highest positive predictive value for seropositivity. The rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 25.9%, and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres were observed in symptomatic individuals. Spatio-temporal hotspots of SARS-CoV-2-positive staff and patients only showed partial overlap.

ConclusionsPatient-facing work in a healthcare facility during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be safe if adequate PPE and hygiene measures are applied. The high numbers of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections that escaped detection by symptomatic testing underline the value of cross-sectional seroprevalence studies. Unprotected contact is a major risk factor for infection and argues for the rigorous implementation of hygiene measures.",Johanna Erber; Verena Kappler; Bernhard Haller; Hrvoje Mijocevic; Ana Galhoz; Clarissa Prazeres da Costa; Friedemann Gebhardt; Natalia Graf; Dieter Hoffmann; Markus Thaler; Elke Lorenz; Hedwig Roggendorf; Florian Kohlmayer; Andreas Henkel; Michael M Menden; Juergen Ruland; Christoph D Spinner; Ulrike Protzer; Percy Knolle; Paul Lingor,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206136,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206136,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize the current evidence on KAPs regarding COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search on PubMed/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 Jul 2020. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. PROSPERO registration code: (CRD42020186755).

ResultsFifty-two studies encompassing 49786 participants were included in this review. 45.76% of the participants were male. The mean age of the participants was 32.6 years. 44.2% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 46.2% as fair quality, and remaining (9.6%) as low quality. 30.76% examined all three components of the KAPs model.

Use of CCP units with a signal-to-cutoff ratio of [&ge;]12 using the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (OVSARS2IgG) is authorized. Little is known about the relationship between this ratio and the neutralizing capacity of plasma/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2 virus. We measured the neutralizing capacity of 981 samples from 196 CCP donors 7-119 days post initial donation (DPID). Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Importantly, while 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT90/PRNT50) of donations met the FDA minimum titer of 1:80 initially, only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met this cut-off [&ge;]85 DPID. A subset of 91 donations were evaluated using the OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy.

We used Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) and summary-based Mendelian randomization to combine gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Lung eQTL (n=1,038) and eQTLGen (n=31,784) studies with published COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Additionally, we used COLOC to integrate plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from the INTERVAL study (n=3,301) with COVID-19-associated loci. Finally, we determined any causal associations between plasma proteins and COVID-19 using multi-variable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). We found that the expression of 20 genes in lung and 31 genes in blood was associated with COVID-19. Of these genes, only three (LZTFL1, SLC6A20 and ABO) had been previously linked with COVID-19 in GWAS. The novel loci included genes involved in interferon pathways (IL10RB, IFNAR2 and OAS1). Plasma ABO protein, which is associated with blood type in humans, demonstrated a significant causal relationship with COVID-19 in MR analysis; increased plasma levels were associated with an increased risk of having COVID-19 and risk of severe COVID-19. In summary, our study identified genes associated with COVID-19 that may be prioritized for future investigation. Importantly, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal association between plasma ABO protein and COVID-19.",Ana I Hernandez Cordero; Xuan Li; Stephen Milne; Chen Xi Yang; Yohan Bosse; Philippe Joubert; Wim Timens; Maarten van den Berge; David Nickle; Ke Hao; Don D Sin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207118,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207118,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
496,"Sars-Cov-2 in Argentina: Lockdown, Mobility, and Contagion","There is a debate in Argentina about the effectiveness of mandatory lockdown measures in containing COVID-19 that lasts five months making it one of the longest in the World. The population effort to comply the lockdown has been decreasing over time given the economic and social costs that it entails. We contributes by analyzing the Argentinian case through information of mobility and contagion given answers to recurrent questions on these topics. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing the effects of lockdown measures and the regional relaxation on the numbers of rate of new infections. We also respond to issues of internal political discussion on regional contagion and the effect of marches and unexpected crowd events. We use pool, fixed and random effects panel data modeling and Granger causality tests identifying relations between mobility and contagion. Our results show that lockdown in Argentina has been effective in reducing the mobility but not in way that reduces the rate of contagion. Strict lockdown seems to be effective in short periods of time and by extend it without complementary measures loss effectiveness. Contagion rate seems to be discretely displaced in time and resurging amidst slowly increasing in mobility.",Juan M.C.

497,Serological testing in addition to PCR screening for the re-opening of American colleges and universities: potential for cost-savings without compromising pandemic mitigation,"ImportanceThe addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan.

ObjectivesTo determine whether a college/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresTesting costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing.

ResultsIncluding baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions.

Conclusions and RelevanceWhile regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.

Key Points (96/100)O_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan the addition of a serological testing reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for universities in the United States?

FindingsThis costing study suggested that inclusion of serological testing in addition to outsourced PCR testing as part of a university re-opening strategy could achieve cost savings of up to 20%. The amount of savings, or additional costs, is dependent on insourcing or outsourcing of testing, epidemic conditions and university size.

498,Development of a customised data management system for a COVID-19-adapted colorectal cancer pathway,"PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems around the world. To mitigate the risks of those referred with possible colorectal cancer during the pandemic we implemented a clinical pathway which required a customised data management system for robust operation. Here, we describe the principal concepts and evaluation of the performance of a spreadsheet-based data management system.

MethodsA system was developed using Microsoft Excel(R) 2007 aiming to retain the spreadsheets inherent intuitiveness of direct data entry. Data was itemised limiting entry errors. Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was used to construct a user-friendly interface to enhance efficiency of data entry and segregate the data required for operational tasks. This was done with built-in loop-back data entry. Finally data derivation and analysis was performed to facilitate pathway monitoring.

ResultsFor a pathway which required rapid implementation and development of a customised data management system, the use of a spreadsheet was advantageous due to its user-friendly direct data entry capability. Its function was enhanced by UserForm and large data handling by data segregation using VBA macros. Data validation and conditional formatting minimised data entry errors. Computation by the COUNT function facilitated live data monitoring on a dashboard. During the three months the pathway ran for, the system processed 36 nodal data points for each of the included 837 patients. Data monitoring confirmed its accuracy.

ConclusionLarge volume data management using a spreadsheet system is possible with appropriate data definition and VBA programmed data segregation. Clinicians regular input and optimisation made the system adaptable for rapid implementation.",Frances Gunn; Janice Miller; Malcolm G Dunlop; Farhat V N Din; Yasuko Maeda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206920,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206920,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
499,Rationale and prognosis of repurposed drugs with risk stratification of patients in oxygen support in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"There has been rapid development of clinical trials conducted on antivirals, immunomodulators, and other therapies against COVID-19. The rising number of trials has led to duplication and a need for curation of available outcomes from treatments that have been followed across the world. We have conducted a systematic review and meta analysis that focus on evaluating the clinical outcomes of repurposed drugs against COVID-19 including Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Dexamethasome, Lopinavir-ritonavir, Favipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine and Convalescent plasma therapy. Twenty-nine articles were included in this study after thorough literature search and performed subgroup analyses based on disease severity levels. Random effects model was adopted to estimate overall treatment effect and heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis on mortality rate showed significant overall effect in the treatment group of studies having critically ill patients (p<0.01). Meta-regression analysis was performed to study the association of drug efficacy in patients with different comorbidities and factors that influence the patients prevalence in non-invasive and invasive ventilation support. Overall, our study confirmed that tocilizumab may probably reduce the mortality (<10%) of patients with COVID-19 with faster recovery time and reduce the risk of patients with lung disease in falling into oxygen support (P=0.02). Patients on Remdesivir showed no significant associations of comorbidities with risk of falling into oxygen supports. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be inefficacious in COVID-19 patients (OR 0.64; 95%CI [0.47-0.86]). Dexamethasone had marginal effect on overall mortality rate (OR 1.19; 95%CI [1.05-1.35]). There was also evidence suggesting that combination therapies (Serpin + Favipiravir) were helpful in reducing the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients under invasive support.",Esther Jebarani Elangovan; Vanitha Shyamili Kumar; Adhithyan Kathiravan; Raghav Mallampalli; Tiju Thomas; Gnanasambandam Subramaniyam,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206516,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206516,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
500,The relative effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on early Covid-19 mortality: natural experiment in 130 countries,"BackgroundConcurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented around the world to control Covid-19 transmission. Their general effect on reducing virus transmission is proven, but they can also be negative to mental health and economies, and transmission behaviours can also change in absence of mandated policies. Their relative impact on Covid-19 attributed mortality rates, enabling policy selection for maximal benefit with minimal disruption, is not well established.

MethodsWe exploited variations in nine non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 130 countries (3250 observations) in two periods chosen to limit reverse causality: i) prior to first Covid-19 death (when policymakers could not possibly be reacting to deaths in their own country); and, ii) 14-days-post first Covid-19 death (when deaths were still low, on average). We examined associations with daily deaths per million in each subsequent 24-day period (the time between virus transmission and mortality) which could only be affected by the policy period. A mean score of strictness and timeliness was coded for each intervention. Days in each country were indexed in time by first reported Covid-19 death to proxy for virus transmission rate. Multivariable linear regression models of Covid-19 mortality rates on all concurrent interventions were adjusted for seasonality, potential confounders, and potential cross-country differences in their mortality definitions. Robustness was checked by removing countries with known data reporting issues and with non-linear, negative binomial, models.

ResultsAfter adjusting for multiple concurrent interventions and confounders, and accounting for both timing and strictness of interventions, earlier and stricter school (-1.23 daily deaths per million, 95% CI -2.20 -0.27) and workplace closures (-0.26, 95% CI -0.46 -0.05) were associated with lower Covid-19 mortality rates. Only controlling for strictness international travel controls, and only controlling for timing later restrictions on gatherings, were also associated with lower Covid-19 mortality. Other interventions, such as stay-at-home orders or restrictions on public transport, were not significantly associated with differences in mortality rates across countries. Findings were robust across multiple statistical approaches.

501,Comparative policy analysis of face mask mandates during COVID 19 pandemic on rate of mask use in the United States,"As COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States, there has been a search for policies to prevent individual infections, to slow the spread of the virus in general, and to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. Masks have proven to be a cost-effective measure in all regards, and as such some state governments have begun to mandate their use. However, while the efficacy of masks has been demonstrated, the efficacy of public policies which mandate the use of masks has not been demonstrated. This paper compares the rates of mask use in counties as defined by state policy. It finds that state mandates are strongly correlated with higher rates of mask use, and that mandating use by all individuals in public spaces is more effective than a less comprehensive mandate for mask use by all public facing employees.",Michael J Maloney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206326,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206326,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
502,Development and comparison of a novel multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay with other nucleic acid amplification methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection,"ObjectivesTo develop a novel multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay for COVID-19 and compare its speed and sensitivity to existing loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) methods.

MethodsTwo MCDA assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab was designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and RT-PCR using 7 DNA standards and transcribed RNA.

ResultsFor the N gene, MCDA was consistently faster than LAMP and RT-PCR by 10 and 20 minutes, respectively with a fastest time to detection of 5.2 minutes. RT-PCR had the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of 100 copies/reaction compared with MCDA (1000 copies/reaction) and LAMP (5000/reaction). For ORF1ab, MCDA and LAMP had similar speed with fastest time to detection at 9.7 and 8.4 minutes, respectively. LAMP was more sensitive for ORF1ab detection with 500 copies/reaction compared to MCDA (5000 copies/reaction).

ConclusionsDifferent nucleic acid amplification methods provide different advantages. MCDA is the fastest nucleic acid amplification method for COVID-19 while RT-PCR is still the most sensitive.

504,"Renin Angiotensin System Inhibition and Susceptibility and Outcomes from COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 69,200 COVID-19 Patients","BackgroundEarly observational studies suggested that the use of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, specifically angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, may increase the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and adversely affect the prognosis or survival of infected patients. To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies.

Methods and FindingsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31). There was no significant difference in the severe Covid-19 case rate between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36), (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.12), or in mortality due to COVID-19 between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.44), (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23), (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14).

ConclusionsIn the most comprehensive analysis of all available data to date, treatment with RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of infection, severity of disease, or mortality due to COVID-19. The best available evidence suggests that these treatments should not be discontinued on the basis of concern about risk associated with COVID-19.",Yi Zhang; Shikai Yu; Yawei Xu; Bryan Williams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206375,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206375,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
505,A multiplex microsphere IgG assay for SARS-CoV-2 using ACE2-mediated inhibition as a surrogate for neutralization,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges inherent to the serological detection of a novel pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens--spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals ([&le;]5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at [&le;]5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% vs. 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7; in days from symptom onset), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled ICU patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP.

The challenge of how to communicate these then becomes apparent. Based on empirical work (total n=5,520, UK) supported by in-person interviews with public and physicians, we make recommendations on the presentation of such information. These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing (for balance) a format which conveys a higher perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10,000); using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative  persona who might face that highest level of risk; and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other  personas illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These  personas should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described. By contrast, giving people absolute likelihoods of other risks they face in an attempt to add context was considered less helpful.",Alexandra LJ Freeman; John Kerr; Gabriel Recchia; Claudia Schneider; Alice CE Lawrence; Leila Finikarides; Giulia Luoni; Sarah Dryhurst; David J Spiegelhalter,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206961,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206961,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
507,Assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of household-pooled universal testing to control COVID-19 epidemics,"Current outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics currently relies on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the current testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.",Pieter Jules Karel Libin; Lander Willem; Timothy Verstraeten; Andrea Torneri; Joris Vanderlocht; Niel Hens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205765,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205765,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
508,Impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals on COVID-19 mortality in different countries,"Several recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus. However, pathophysiological implications of these findings remain unknown. Here, the potential impact of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals on markedly different COVID-19 mortality levels in different countries has been investigated. The inverse correlation is documented between the prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus and COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries. In countries with similar levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, differences in COVID-19 mortality appear linked with the extend and consistency of implementations of social measures designed to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing). Collectively, these observations support the model that the level of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is one of the important determinants of the innate herd immunity against COVID-19. Together with the consistent social measures directed to limit the virus spread, high levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells appear significant determinants diminishing the COVID-19 mortality. Observations reported in this contribution should have significant impact on definitions of the herd immunity threshold required to effectively stop the pandemic in different countries across the globe.",Gennadi Glinsky,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206151,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206151,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain.

MethodsIn a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results.

ResultsWe enrolled 1,369 consecutive patients (68 [53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3,822 tests (median 2 [1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1,369), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing.

ConclusionsIn patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.
