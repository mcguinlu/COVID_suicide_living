0,Shed the light on virus: virucidal effects of 405 nm visible light on SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.,"Germicidal potential of specific wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum is an area of growing interest. While ultra-violet (UV) based technologies have shown satisfactory virucidal potential, the photo-toxicity in humans coupled with UV associated polymer degradation limit its use in occupied spaces. Alternatively, longer wavelengths with less irradiation energy such as visible light (405 nm) have largely been explored in the context of bactericidal and fungicidal applications. Such studies indicated that 405 nm mediated inactivation is caused by the absorbance of porphyrins within the organism creating reactive oxygen species which result in free radical damage to its DNA and disruption of cellular functions. The virucidal potential of visible-light based technologies has been largely unexplored and speculated to be not effective given the lack of porphyrins in viruses. The current study demonstrated increased susceptibility of lipid-enveloped respiratory pathogens of importance such as SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) as well as the influenza A virus to 405nm, visible light in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers, indicating a potential porphyrin-independent alternative mechanism of visible light mediated viral inactivation. Given that visible light is generally safe to humans, our results support further exploration of the use of visible light technology for the application of continuous decontamination in areas within hospitals and/or infectious disease laboratories, specifically for the inactivation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A.",Clifford J Yahnke; Raveen J Rathnasinghe; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435337,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435337,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
1,Impact of School Reopening on Pandemic Spread: A Case Study using an Agent-Based Model for COVID-19,"This article examines the impact of partial/full reopening of school/college campuses on the spread of a pandemic using COVID-19 as a case study. The study uses an agent-based simulation model that replicates community spread in an urban region of U.S.A. via daily social mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the model's behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15 %) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.",Hanisha Anand Tatapudi; Tapas K Das,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253485,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253485,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,True
2,The local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults,"While a substantial proportion of adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 progress to develop severe disease, children rarely manifest respiratory complications. Therefore, understanding differences in the local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults may provide important clues about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we first generated a healthy reference multi-omics single cell data set from children (n=30) in whom we have profiled triple matched samples: nasal and tracheal brushings and PBMCs, where we track the developmental changes for 42 airway and 31 blood cell populations from infancy, through childhood to adolescence. This has revealed the presence of naive B and T lymphocytes in neonates and infants with a unique gene expression signature bearing hallmarks of innate immunity. We then contrast the healthy reference with equivalent data from severe paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients (total n=27), from the same three types of samples: upper and lower airways and blood. We found striking differences: children with COVID-19 as opposed to adults had a higher proportion of innate lymphoid and non-clonally expanded naive T cells in peripheral blood, and a limited interferon-response signature. In the airway epithelium, we found the highest viral load in goblet and ciliated cells and describe a novel inflammatory epithelial cell population. These cells represent a transitional regenerative state between secretory and ciliated cells; they were found in healthy children and were enriched in pediatric and adult COVID-19 patients. Epithelial cells display an antiviral and neutrophil-recruiting gene signature that is weaker in severe paediatric versus adult COVID-19. Our matched blood and airway samples allowed us to study the spatial dynamics of infection. Lastly, we provide a user-friendly interface for this data as a highly granular reference for the study of immune responses in airways and blood in children.",Masahiro Yoshida; Kaylee B Worlock; Ni Huang; Rik GH Lindeboom; Colin R Butler; Natsuhiko Kumasaka; Cecilia Dominguez Conde; Lira Mamanova; Liam Bolt; Laura Richardson; Krzysztof Polanski; Elo Madissoon; Josephine L Barnes; Jessica Allen-Hyttinen; Eliz Kilich; Brendan C Jones; Angus de Wilton; Anna Wilbrey-Clark; Waradon Sungnak; Jan Patrick Prett; Elena Prigmore; Henry Yung; Puja Mehta; Aarash Saleh; Anita Saigal; Vivian Chu; Jonathan M Cohen; Clare Cane; Aikaterini Iordanidou; Soichi Shibuya; Ann-Kathrin Reuschl; A.

3,Monitoring the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Tenerife (Spain) since mid-December 2020,"Starting in December 2020, a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases occurred in Tenerife compared to the rest of the Canary Islands (Spain). Because of the direct touristic connections between Tenerife and the UK, and the rapid transmission and dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC-202012/01) by the end of November 2020 in South England, here we measured the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases occurring between the 18th of December 2020 and the 25th of February 2021. Out of the 2,091 COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples assessed, 226 showed a spike gene target failure (SGTF). Subsequent viral genome sequencing further confirmed that 93.2% of them corresponded to the B.1.1.7 lineage. Furthermore, a rapid increase in the proportion of SGTF variants was detected in up to 10.7% of positive cases during the Christmas season despite stricter measures for containing the transmission were imposed in Tenerife in the period. These results support the local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in Tenerife since late December 2020 although it is not yet dominant.",Julia Alcoba-Florez; Jose M.

4,Persisting Salivary IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at 9 Months After Mild COVID-19: A Complementary Approach to Population Surveys,"Background: Declining humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients and possibility of reinfections has raised concern. Mucosal immunity particularly salivary antibodies could be short-lived. However, long-term studies are sparse. Methods: Using a multiplex bead-based array platform, we investigated antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in 256 saliva samples from convalescent patients 1-9 months after symptomatic COVID-19 (n=74, Cohort 1), undiagnosed individuals with self-reported questionnaires (n=147, Cohort 2), and individuals sampled pre-pandemic time (n= 35, Cohort 3). Results: Salivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to 9 month recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At 9 months, IgG remained in saliva in majority as seen in blood serology. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments. Conclusions: Unlike SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA that appeared short-lived, the specific IgG in saliva appears stable even after mild COVID-19 as noted for blood serology. The non-invasive saliva-based SARS-Cov-2 antibody testing with self-collection at homes may thus serve as a complementary alternative to conventional blood serology.",Hassan Alkharaan; Shaghayegh Bayati; Cecilia Hellstrom; Annika Olsson; Karin Lindahl; Gordana Bogdanovic; Soo Aleman; Georgios Tsilingaridis; Patricia De Palma; Sophia Hober; Anna Manberg; Peter Nilsson; Elisa Pin; Margaret Sallberg Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253492,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253492,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,True
5,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 N-terminal domain dimerizes and harbors autonomously folded elements,"The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein is a critical component of the RNA replicase, as its N-terminal domain (NTD) anchors Nsp12, the RNA, and Nsp13. Whereas its C-terminal domain (CTD) structure is well resolved, there is an open debate regarding the conformation adopted by the NTD as it is predicted as disordered but found in a variety of complex-dependent conformations or missing from many other structures. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the SARS CoV-2 Nsp8 NTD features both well folded secondary structure and disordered segments. Our results suggest that while part of this domain corresponding to two long -helices forms autonomously, the folding of other segments would require interaction with other replicase components. When isolated, the -helix population progressively declines towards the C-termini, and dynamics measurements indicate that the Nsp8 NTD behaves as a dimer under our conditions.",Miguel Á Treviño; David Pantoja-Uceda; Douglas Vinson Laurents; Miguel Mompeán,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435186,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435186,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
6,SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION OF COVID-19 MITIGATION (SOCOM): ASSESSING FACE COVERING AND DISTANCING IN SCHOOLS,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall of 2020. Physical distancing and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, no research has focused on mitigation strategy adherence during school days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM). Methods: We extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop the SOCOM training and implementation protocol to assess physical distancing and face covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs). Results: For the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with more activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were ideal for accurately capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing (90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level (87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with [&ge;]20 students. Conclusions: Millions of children throughout the US are likely to return to school in the months ahead despite the current surge of COVID-19 cases. SOCOM is a relatively inexpensive tool that can be implemented by schools to determine mitigation strategy adherence and assess changes to protocols to help students return to school safely and slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be used for research purposes.",Ricky Camplain; Nanette V.

9,HIV service interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: the role of HIV service challenges and institutional response from healthcare professional's perspective,"Background: The healthcare system in China was largely overwhelmed during the unprecedented pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). HIV-related services have been unavoidably interrupted and impacted. However, the nature and scope of HIV service interruptions due to COVID-19 has rarely been characterized in China and how HIV service challenges affect the service interruptions are also unclear. The current study aimed at characterize HIV service interruption levels and analyzed its associated factors related to service challenges and institutional response from HIV healthcare providers' viewpoint. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1,029 HIV healthcare providers in Guangxi, China, from April to May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was first used to identify HIV service interruption levels. Then hierarchical multinomial logistic regression was conducted to analyze the relationships of HIV care service challenges and institutional response with HIV service interruption levels. Simple slope analysis was employed to examine interaction effects between HIV service challenges and institutional response to COVID-19. Results: Four classes of HIV service interruption were identified using LCA, with 22.0% complete interruption (class 1), 15.4% moderate interruption (class 2), 21.9% minor interruption (class 3) and 40.7% almost no interruption (class 4). Using class 4 as a reference group, HIV care service challenges were positively associated with the probabilities of service interruptions (Class 1: AOR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.19~1.26; Class 2: AOR= 1.10, 95%CI: 1.08~1.13; Class 3: AOR= 1.10, 95%CI: 1.08~1.12). Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery was negatively associated with the probabilities of being classified into Class 1 (""Complete interruption"") (AOR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.93~1.00) and Class 3 (""minor interruption [Outreach service]"") (AOR=0.96, 95%CI: 0.93~0.99) as compared to Class 4 (""almost no interruption""). Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery moderated the association of HIV service challenges with complete interruption, but not with the moderate or minor interruption when comparing with no interruption group. Conclusions: A substantial HIV service interruptions occurs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly services that require face-to-face interactions, such as VCT counselling, follow up and outreach services. HIV service challenges largely hinder the HIV service delivery. Institutional response to HIV healthcare delivery could marginally buffer the negative effect of service challenges on complete HIV service interruptions.

10,Durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG responses in saliva for up to 8 months after infection,"We evaluated the durability of IgG responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), receptor binding domain (RBD), and spike (S) antigens in saliva up to 8 months after RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 using a multiplex salivary assay. We estimated a half-life of 64 days (d) (95% CI: 49, 80 d) for N, 100 d for RBD (95% CI: 58, 141 d), and 148 d (95% CI: 62, 238 d) for S IgG responses in saliva, consistent with half-life estimates previously reported in blood. Saliva can serve as an alternative to blood to monitor humoral immune responses on a large scale following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination for surveillance and assessment of population immunity.",Pranay R.

11,A novel soluble ACE2 protein totally protects from lethal disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses full-length angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is membrane bound, as its initial cell contact receptor preceding viral entry. Here we report a human soluble ACE2 variant fused with a 5kD albumin binding domain (ABD) and bridged via a dimerization motif hinge-like 4-cysteine dodecapeptide, which we term ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD. This protein is enzymatically active, has increased duration of action in vivo conferred by the ABD-tag, and displays 20-30-fold higher binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain than its des-DDC monomeric form (ACE2 1-618-ABD) due to DDC-linked dimerization. ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD was administered for 3 consecutive days to transgenic k18-hACE2 mice, a model that develops lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection, to evaluate the preclinical preventative/ therapeutic value for COVID-19. Mice treated with ACE2 1-618-DDC-ABD developed a mild to moderate disease for the first few days assessed by a clinical score and modest weight loss. The untreated control animals, by contrast, became severely ill and had to be sacrificed by day 6/7 and lung histology revealed extensive pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage and mononuclear infiltrates. At 6 days, mortality was totally prevented in the treated group, lung histopathology was improved and viral titers markedly reduced. This demonstrates for the first time in vivo the preventative/ therapeutic potential of a novel soluble ACE2 protein in a preclinical animal model.",Luise Hassler; Jan Wysocki; Ian Gelarden; Anastasia Tomatsidou; Haley Gula; Vlad Nicoleascu; Glenn Randall; Jack Henkin; Anjana Yeldandi; Daniel Batlle,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435191,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435191,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
12,A map of direct SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions implicates specific human host processes,"Key steps in viral propagation, immune suppression and pathology are mediated by direct, binary physical interactions between viral and host proteins. To understand the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we generated an unbiased systematic map of binary physical interactions between viral and host interactions, complementing previous co-complex association maps by conveying more direct mechanistic understanding and enabling targeted disruption of direct interactions. To this end, we deployed two parallel strategies, identifying 205 virus-host and 27 intraviral binary interactions amongst 171 host and 19 viral proteins, with orthogonal validation by an internally benchmarked NanoLuc two-hybrid system to ensure high data quality. Host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins were enriched in various cellular processes, including immune signaling and inflammation, protein ubiquitination, and membrane trafficking. Specific subnetworks provide new hypotheses related to viral modulation of host protein homeostasis and T-cell regulation. The direct virus-host protein interactions we identified can now be prioritized as targets for therapeutic intervention.

13,Differential gene expression by RNA-Seq in Sigma-2 Receptor/TMEM97 knockout cells reveals its role in complement activation and SARS-CoV-2 viral uptake,"Our lab has recently shown that the Sigma-2 Receptor/Transmembrane Protein 97 (sigma- 2R/TMEM97) interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and facilitates the enhanced uptake of various ligands including lipoproteins and intrinsically disordered proteins. TMEM97 has been recently been shown to interact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins, highlighting its potential involvement with viral entry into the cell. We hypothesized that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may play a role in facilitating viral uptake, and with the regulation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways that are involved with viral infection. In this study, we identified the top differentially expressed genes upon the knockout of sigma-2R/TMEM97, and analyzed the genes involved with the inflammatory and thrombotic cascades, effects that are observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the ablation of sigma-2R/TMEM97 resulted in an increase in Complement Component 4 Binding Protein (C4BP) proteins, at both the translational and transcriptional levels. We also showed that sigma-2R/TMEM97 interacts with the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, forming a protein complex, and that disruption of this complex results in the inhibition of viral uptake. The results of this study suggest that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may be a novel therapeutic target to inhibit SARS- CoV-2 viral uptake, as well as to decrease inflammatory and thrombotic effects through the modulation of the complement cascade.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435180,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435180,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
14,"Structure, Mechanism and Crystallographic fragment screening of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase","The global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has infected over 100 million and caused over 2 million fatalities worldwide at the point of writing. There is currently a lack of effective drugs to treat people infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) is a superfamily1B helicase that has been identified as a possible target for anti-viral drugs due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. In this study we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP). Comparisons of these structures reveal details of global and local conformational changes that are induced by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. Structural analysis reveals two pockets on NSP13 that are classified as ""druggable"" and include one of the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. To identify possible starting points for anti-viral drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase. The fragment screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets, with hot spots in pockets predicted to be of functional importance, including the druggable nucleotide and nucleic acid binding sites, opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.",Joseph A Newman; Alice Douangamath; Setayesh Yazdani; Yuliana Yosaatmadja; Anthony Aimon; Jose Brandao-Neto; Louise Dunnett; Tyler Gorrie-Stone; Rachael Skyner; Daren Fearon; Matthieu Schapira; Frank von Delft; Opher Gileadi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435326,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.435326,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
15,S-acylation controls SARS-Cov-2 membrane lipid organization and enhances infectivity,"SARS-CoV-2 virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer which contains membrane proteins such as Spike, responsible for target-cell binding and virus fusion, the envelope protein E and the accessory protein Orf3a. Here, we show that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, all three proteins become lipid modified, through action of the S- acyltransferase ZDHHC20. Particularly striking is the rapid acylation of Spike on 10 cytosolic cysteines within the ER and Golgi. Using a combination of computational, lipidomics and biochemical approaches, we show that this massive lipidation controls Spike biogenesis and degradation, and drives the formation of localized ordered cholesterol and sphingolipid rich lipid nanodomains, in the early Golgi where viral budding occurs. ZDHHC20-mediated acylation allows the formation of viruses with enhanced fusion capacity and overall infectivity.

The interaction between the ACE2 receptors at the surface of human cells and the viral Spike (S) protein triggers the infection making the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein a focal target for the neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Despite the recent progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, the emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to Abs produced in response to the vaccine administration and/or monoclonal ones represents upcoming jeopardy. Here, we assessed the possible effects of single and multiple mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein on its binding energy to various antibodies and the human ACE2 receptor. The performed computational analysis indicates that while single amino acid replacements in RBD may only cause partial impairment of the Abs binding, moreover, limited to specific epitopes, some variants of SARS-CoV-2 (with as few as 8 mutations), which are already present in the population, may potentially result in a much broader antigenic escape. We also identified a number of point mutations, which, in contrast to the majority of replacements, reduce RBD affinity to various antibodies without affecting its binding to ACE2. Overall, the results provide guidelines for further experimental studies aiming at the identification of the high-risk RBD mutations allowing for an antigenic escape.",Marine E Bozdaganyan; Olga S Sokolova; Konstantin V Shaitan; Mikhail P Kirpichnikov; Philipp S Orekhov,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435322,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.435322,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
18,BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine induces antibodies of broader cross-reactivity than natural infection but recognition of mutant viruses is up to 10-fold reduced,"Background: Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged since fall 2020 which have multiple mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Objective: We aimed to assess how mutations in RBD affected recognition of immune sera by antibodies induced by natural infection versus immunization with BNT162b2, a mRNA- based vaccine against COVID-19. Methods: We produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants with single mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region (E484K, K417N, N501Y) or with all 3 mutations combined, as occurring in the newly emerged variants B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Using standard and avidity ELISAs, we determined the binding capacities to mutant RBDs of antibodies induced by infection versus vaccination. Results: These binding assays showed that vaccination induced antibodies recognize both wildtype and mutant RBDs with higher avidities than those raised by infection. Nevertheless, recognition of mutants RBDK417N and RBDN501Y was 2.5-3-fold reduced while RBDE484K and the triple mutant were 10-fold less well recognized, demonstrating that the mutation at position 484 was key for the observed loss in cross-reactivity. Conclusion: Our binding data demonstrate improved recognition of mutant viruses by BNT162b2-induced antibodies compared to those induced by natural infection. Recognition may, however, be 10-fold reduced for the variants B.1.351/P.1, suggesting that the development of a new vaccine is warranted. The E484K mutation is an key hurdle for immune recognition, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy as well as serological assays based on the wildtype sequence may therefore seriously impaired.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.435222,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.435222,2021-03-15,2021-03-15,,False
19,Antibody evasion by the Brazilian P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2,"Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K, K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2 binding site mutations, we explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.",Wanwisa Dejnirattisai; Damin Zhou; Piyada Supasa; Chang Liu; Alexander J.

20,Structural basis for backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex,"Backtracking, the reverse motion of the transcriptase enzyme on the nucleic acid template, is a universal regulatory feature of transcription in cellular organisms but its role in viruses is not established. Here we present evidence that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein crosslinking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3'-segment of the product-RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product-RNA 3'-end frays and enters the NTP-entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking. Backtracking may aid proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against antivirals.",Brandon Malone; James Chen; Qi Wang; Eiiza Llewellyn; Young Joo Choi; Paul Dominic B.

21,Clomipramine suppresses ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry,"Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells are initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection. Here, we found that clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and metabolic disorder in human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Among 13 approved drugs that we have previously identified as potential inhibitor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, clomipramine showed the best potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-stimulated ACE2 internalization. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection to human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) and TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells were dramatically suppressed even after treatment with clomipramine. Furthermore, the combined use of clomipramine and remdesivir was revealed to synergistically suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.

22,"A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of convalescent plasma in adults with severe COVID-19","BackgroundAlthough convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), data from randomized controlled trials that support its efficacy are limited.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19.

DesignRandomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted from April 21st to November 27th, 2020.

SettingFive hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

ParticipantsHospitalized patients aged [&ge;]18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, infiltrates on chest imaging and oxygen saturation [&le;] 94% on room air or requirement for supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

InterventionParticipants were randomized 2:1 to a single transfusion of either 1 unit of convalescent or normal control plasma.

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.

ResultsOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in clinical status was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (with an odds ratio (OR) of a 1-point improvement in the scale: 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.68, p=0.180).

However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples (n=40) from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected. Serious adverse events occurred in 39/147 (27%) participants who received convalescent plasma and 26/72 (36%) participants who received control plasma.

LimitationsSome participants did not receive high-titer convalescent plasma.

ConclusionIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in 28 days clinical status. The significant reduction in mortality associated with convalescent plasma, however, may warrant further evaluation.

23,"COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Hesitancy in Low and Middle Income Countries, and Implications for Messaging","Background As vaccination campaigns are deployed worldwide, addressing vaccine hesitancy is of critical importance to ensure sufficient immunization coverage. We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 samples covering ten low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America, and two higher income countries (Russia and the United States). Methods Standardized survey responses were collected from 45,928 individuals between June 2020 and January 2021. We estimate vaccine acceptance with robust standard errors clustered at the study level. We analyze stated reasons for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, and the most trusted sources for advice on vaccination, and we disaggregate acceptance rates by gender, age, and education level. Findings We document willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, ranging from 67% (Burkina Faso) to 97% (Nepal). Willingness was considerably higher in LMICs (80%) than in the United States (65%) and Russia (30%). Vaccine acceptance was primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against the disease (91%). Concern about side effects (40%) was the most common reason for reluctance. Health workers were considered the most trusted sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Interpretation Given high levels of stated willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, our study suggests that prioritizing efficient and equitable vaccine distribution to LMICs will yield high returns in promoting immunization on a global scale. Messaging and other community-level interventions in these contexts should be designed to help translate intentions into uptake, and emphasize safety and efficacy.

24,Predictive and Causal Analysis of No-Shows for Medical Exams During COVID-19: A Case Study of Breast Imaging in a Nationwide Israeli Health Organization,"""No-shows"", defined as missed appointments or late cancellations, is a central problem in healthcare systems. It has appeared to intensify during the COVID-19 pandemic and the nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as closures, taken to slow its spread. No-shows interfere with patients continuous care, lead to inefficient utilization of medical resources, and increase healthcare costs. We present a comprehensive analysis of no-shows for breast imaging appointments made during 2020 in a large medical network in Israel. We applied advanced machine learning methods to provide insights into novel and known predictors. Additionally, we employed causal inference methodology to infer the effect of closures on no-shows, after accounting for confounding biases, and demonstrate the superiority of adversarial balancing over inverse probability weighting in correcting these biases. Our results imply that a patients perceived risk of cancer and the COVID-19 time-based factors are major predictors. Further, we reveal that closures impact patients over 60, but not patients undergoing advanced diagnostic examinations.",Michal Ozery-Flato; Ora Pinchasov; Miel Dabush-Kasa; Efrat Hexter; Gabriel Chodick; Michal Guindy; Michal Rosen-Zvi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253358,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253358,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
25,Rapid implementation of a cohort for the study of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19,"BACKGROUNDAs the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues and millions remain vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), attention has turned to characterizing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

METHODSFrom April 21 to December 31, 2020, we assembled a cohort of consecutive volunteers who a) had documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positivity; b) were [&ge;] 2 weeks past onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first test for SARS-CoV-2; and c) were able to travel to our site in San Francisco. Participants learned about the study by being identified on medical center-based registries and being notified or by responding to advertisements. At 4-month intervals, we asked participants about physical symptoms that were new or worse compared to the period prior to COVID-19, mental health symptoms and quality of life. We described 4 time periods: 1) acute illness (0-3 weeks), 2) early recovery (3-10 weeks), 3) late recovery 1 (12-20 weeks), and 4) late recovery 2 (28-36 weeks). Blood and oral specimens were collected at each visit.

RESULTSWe have, to date, enrolled 179 adults. During acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 had been asymptomatic, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. In the acute phase, the most common symptoms were fatigue, fever, myalgia, cough and anosmia/dysgeusia. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were the most commonly reported symptoms, but a variety of others were endorsed by at least some participants. Some experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with ambulation and performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale value rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months (80, interquartile range [IQR]: 70-90; and 80, IQR 75-90) compared to prior to COVID-19 (85; IQR 75-90). Biospecimens were collected at nearly 600 participant-visits.

CONCLUSIONAmong a cohort of participants enrolled in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found many with persistent physical symptoms through 8 months following onset of COVID-19 with an impact on self-rated overall health. The presence of participants with and without symptoms and ample biological specimens will facilitate study of PASC pathogenesis. Similar evaluations in a population-representative sample will be needed to estimate the population-level prevalence of PASC.",Michael J. Peluso; J. Daniel Kelly; Scott Lu; Sarah A.

26,New SARS-CoV-2 lineages could evade CD8+ T-cells response,"BackgroundMany SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have emerged since the Covid-19 outburst, notably the lineages detected in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However, not enough attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of infection by new lineages.

MethodsIn this work, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and the potential of associated mutations to trigger or hinder CD8+ T-cells response. We also estimated the populations coverage of these different lineages, considering peptide binding predictions to class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages.

ResultsWe observed a lower populational coverage for 20B/S.484K (P2 lineage) in contrast to an increased coverage found for 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 Lineage) and 20J/501Y.V3 (P1 lineage) compared to a reference lineage. Moreover, mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid T205I were predicted to have an overall higher affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence.

ConclusionsIn summary, the data in this work provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also highlights the reduced populationals coverage for the Brazilian lineage P.1, suggesting its potential to evade from CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results also may guide efforts to characterize and validate relevant peptides to trigger CD8+ T-cell responses, and design new universal T-cell-inducing vaccine candidates that minimize detrimental effects of viral diversification and at the same time induce responses to a broad human population.",Marco Antonio Marques Pretti; Romulo Goncalves Galvani; Alessandro S Farias; Mariana Boroni,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434584,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434584,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,False
27,All Models Are Useful: Bayesian Ensembling for Robust High Resolution COVID-19 Forecasting,"Timely, high-resolution forecasts of infectious disease incidence are useful for policy makers in deciding intervention measures and estimating healthcare resource burden. In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our model's performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections. Our work demonstrates that such a real-time high resolution forecasting pipeline can be developed by integrating multiple methods within a performance-based ensemble to support pandemic response.",Aniruddha Adiga; Lijing Wang; Benjamin Hurt; Akhil Sai Peddireddy; Przemyslaw Porebski; Srinivasan Venkatramanan; Bryan Lewis; Madhav Marathe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253495,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253495,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
28,Modeling the use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to safely relax non-pharmaceutical interventions,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, mask wearing, and enhanced hygiene, have been implemented. As of March 2021, three effective vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the United States, with several other vaccines in the pipeline. We use a transmission model to study when and how NPIs could be relaxed in the United States with relative safety as vaccination becomes more widespread. We compare different relaxation scenarios where NPIs begin to relax 0-9 months after vaccination begins for both a one dose and two dose strategy, with historical levels of social interactions being reached within 1 month to 1 year. In our model, vaccination can allow widespread relaxation of NPIs to begin safely within 2 to 9 months, greatly reducing deaths and peak health system burden compared to relaxing NPIs without vaccination. Vaccinated individuals can safely begin to relax NPIs sooner than unvaccinated individuals. The extent of delay needed to safely reopen depends primarily on the rate of vaccine rollout, with the degree of protection against asymptomatic infection playing a secondary role. If a vaccination rate of 3 million doses/day can be achieved, similar to the typical rollout speed of seasonal influenza vaccination, NPIs could begin to be safely relaxed in 2-3 months. With a vaccination rate of 1 million doses/day, a 6-9-month delay is needed. A one dose strategy is preferred if relative efficacy is similar to a two-dose series, but the relative benefit of this strategy is minimal when vaccine rollout is fast. Due to the urgent need to pursue strategies that enable safe relaxation of NPIs, we recommend a two-dose strategy with an initial delay of at least 3 months in relaxing restrictions further, and that the speed of vaccine rollout be given immediate priority.",Alicia N M Kraay; Molly E.

29,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Although the number of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases continues to increase globally, there are few studies on the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with COVID-19. Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents to better guide the response to the current epidemic. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI (Chinese database), Clinical Trials.gov and chictr.org.cn (China). The methodological quality of the included literature was evaluated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14.0. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified using I2. We used fixed-effects or random-effects models to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated by the Begg's test. Results: We analyzed 49 studies involving 1627 patients. In the pooled data, the most common clinical symptoms were fever (56% [0.50-0.61]) and cough (45% [0.39-0.51]). The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated procalcitonin (40% [0.23-0.57]), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (31% [0.19-0.43]), increased lymphocyte count (28% [0.17-0.42]), increased creatine kinase (28% [0.18- 0.40]), and elevated C-reactive protein (26% [0.17-0.36]). The most common abnormalities determined by computed tomography were lower-lobe involvement (56% [0.42- 0.70]), ground-glass opacities (33% [0.25-0.42]), bilateral pneumonia (32% [0.24- 0.40]), patchy shadowing (31% [0.18- 0.45]), and upper lobe involvement (30% [0.20- 0.41]). Conclusion: Disease severity among children and adolescents with COVID-19 was milder than that among adult patients, with a greater proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases, and thus, the diagnosis of COVID-19 and control of the infection source are more challenging.",Lixiang Lou Sr.; Hui Zhang Sr.; Baoming Tang Sr.; Ming Li; Zeqing Li; Haifang Cao; Jian Li; Yuliang Chong; Zhaowei Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253472,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253472,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
30,Rapid review of social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundPhysical distancing measures aim to reduce person-to-person contact, a key driver of transmission of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review aims to synthesize empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodWe conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures.

ResultsWe identified 12 studies that reported social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of studies (11/12) collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns and the most stringent physical distancing measures. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2-5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates which ranged from 7-26 contacts per day in similar settings. This reduction was particularly pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates subsequently increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults.

ConclusionInformation on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",Carol Y.

31,The efficacy and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe global total of COVID-19 cases will reach 20 million this week, with 750,000 deaths. It has spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world. At present, the global pandemic continues to rise and continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to explore the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19 as soon as possible. Remdesiviras was an antiviral agent with therapeutic potential, but it was still controversial.

ObjectiveThrough systematic review and meta-analysis, to evaluate the effect and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and will provide a reliable reference for the treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsWe used the following search string: ""COVID-19"" [Mesh], ""remdesivir"" [Mesh], ""randomized controlled trial"" [Mesh]. We used the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and corresponding keywords to make the search strategy. We searched six databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trials.gov and chictr.org.cn. Data analyses were conducted by using the software Review Manager 5.3 and STATA version 14.0.

ResultsOur systematic search identified 5 meta-analyses of RCTs, including 1782 patients with COVID-19.The clinical improvement of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 was superior to the placebo-controlled group (relative risk (RR) =1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.29, p=0.0009). The following are the Single-Arm Study, Meta-analysis results. The pooled prevalence of clinical improvement significant findings was 62% (95% CI = 59-65%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir. The incidence rates of Acute kidney injury, Hepatic enzyme increased, Any serious adverse event were 5% (95%CI=3-7%, p=0.00), 11%(95%CI=5-16%, p=0.00), 22%(95%CI=18-27%, p=0.00), respectively, and the mortality was 13%(95%CI=8-19%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir.

ConclusionThis analysis confirms that remdesivir is effective in the clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients, and the rate of clinical improvement was 62%. In addition, adverse events and mortality should also be paid attention to. Future research should aim that more large-scale studies were needed to confirm the results, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",Lixiang Lou Sr.; Hui Zhang Sr.; Zeqing Li Sr.; Baoming Tang Sr.; Zhaowei Li Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253470,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253470,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
32,Engagement with daily testing instead of self-isolating in contacts of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2.,"Abstract Background In December 2020, Public Health England with NHS Test and Trace initiated a pilot study in which close contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19 were given the option to carryout lateral flow device antigen tests at home, as an alternative to self-isolation for 10-14 days. In this study, we evaluated acceptability of and engagement with daily testing, and assessed levels of adherence to the rules relating to behaviour following positive or negative test results. Methods We conducted a service evaluation of a pilot study, involving an online cross-sectional survey offered to adult (> 18 years) contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases who were invited to participate in seven days of daily testing instead of isolation. We used a comparison group of contacts who were not offered testing and performed self-isolation. Herein, we examine survey responses from a subset of those who took part in the pilot study and who responded to the evaluation questionnaire. Results Acceptability of daily testing was lower among survey respondents who were not offered the option of having it and among people from ethnic minority groups. Overall, 52% of respondents reported being more likely to share details of people that they had been in contact with following a positive test result, if they knew that their contacts would be offered the option of daily testing. Only 2% reported that they would be less likely to provide details of their contacts. On the days that they were trying to self-isolate, 19% of participants reported that they left the house, with no significant demographic group differences. Following a negative test, 13% of respondents reported that they increased their contacts, but most (58%) reported having fewer risky contacts. Conclusions Our data suggest that daily testing is potentially acceptable, and may facilitate sharing contact details of close contacts among those who test positive for COVID-19, and promote adherence to self-isolation. A better understanding is needed of how to make this option more acceptable for all households. The impact of receiving a negative test on behaviour remains a risk that needs to be monitored and mitigated by appropriate messaging. Future research should examine attitudes and behaviour in a context where infection levels are lower, testing is more familiar, much of the population has been vaccinated and restrictions on activity have been reduced.",Alex F Martin; Sarah Denford; Nicola Love; Derren Ready; Isabel Oliver; Richard Amlot; G.

33,"The causal effect of serum vitamin D concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits: a Mendelian randomization study","BackgroundEvidence supporting the role of vitamin D in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains controversial.

MethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to analyze the causal effect of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits by using summary-level GWAS data. The causal associations were estimated with inverse variance weighted (IVW) with fixed effects (IVW-fixed) and random effects (IVW-random), MR-Egger, weighted median and MR Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR.RAPS) methods. We further applied the MR Steiger filtering method, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test and PhenoScanner tool to check and remove single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were horizontally pleiotropic.

ResultsWe found no evidence to support the causal associations between the serum 25(OH)D concentration and the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility (IVW-fixed: odds ratio [OR] = 0.9049, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8197[~]0.9988, p = 0.0473), severity (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0298, 95% CI 0.7699[~]1.3775, p = 0.8432) and hospitalized traits (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0713, 95% CI 0.8819[~]1.3013, p = 0.4878) using outlier removed sets at a Bonferroni-corrected p threshold of 0.0167. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal any sign of horizontal pleiotropy.

ConclusionsOur MR analysis provided precise evidence that genetically lowered serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not causally associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity or hospitalized traits. Our study therefore did not provide evidence assessing the role of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to explore and define the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",Zhiyong Cui; Yun Tian,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252901,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252901,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
34,A potential SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest (VOI) harboring mutation E484K in the Spike protein was identified within lineage B.1.1.33 circulating in Brazil,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil was dominated by two lineages designated as B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33. Two SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the Spike (S) protein, designated as lineages P.1 and P.2, evolved within lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a Variant of Concern (VOC) because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein (including K417T, E484K, N501Y), while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a Variant of Interest (VOI). Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021. This VOI displayed four non-synonymous lineage-defining mutations (NSP3:A1711V, NSP6:F36L, S:E484K, and NS7b:E33A) and was designated as lineage N.9. The VOI N.9 probably emerged in August 2020 and has spread across different Brazilian states from the Southeast, South, North and Northeast regions.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.434969,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.434969,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,False
35,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and viral RNA on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and investigating contamination concentration,"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces. Many studies have used RT-PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered, and whether virus viability is concentration dependant.

Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 124 and 113 hours respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 hours. Viability on cotton was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 72 hours. RNA on all the surfaces exhibited a one log reduction in genome copy recovery over 21 days.

The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on non-porous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces with only one log reduction in recovery over three weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within two days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces it does not directly indicate presence of viable virus even at high CT values.

ImportanceThis study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface. Unless sampled immediately after contamination it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.",Susan Elizabeth Paton; Antony Spencer; Isobel Garratt; Katy-Anne Thompson; Ikshitaa Dinesh; Paz AranegaBou; David Stevenson; Simon O Clark; Jake Dunning; Allan M Bennett; Thomas Pottage,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.435056,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.435056,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,False
36,Multi-resolution characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic: A unified framework and open-source tool,"Amidst the continuing spread of COVID-19, real-time data analysis and visualization remain critical to track the pandemic's impact and inform policy making. Multiple metrics have been considered to evaluate the spread, infection, and mortality of infectious diseases. For example, numbers of new cases and deaths provide measures of absolute impact within a given population and time frame, while the effective reproduction rate provides a measure of the rate of spread. It is critical to evaluate multiple metrics concurrently, as they provide complementary insights into the impact and current state of the pandemic. We describe a unified framework for estimating and quantifying the uncertainty in the smoothed daily effective reproduction number, case rate, and death rate in a region using log-linear models. We apply this framework to characterize COVID-19 impact at multiple geographic resolutions, including by US county and state as well as by country, demonstrating the variation across resolutions and the need for harmonized efforts to control the pandemic. We provide an open-source online dashboard for real-time analysis and visualization of multiple key metrics, which are critical to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and make informed policy decisions.",Andy Shi; Sheila M.

37,COVID-19 Risk Factors and Mortality among Native Americans,"BACKGROUND: Academic research on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 among Native Americans has largely been restricted to particular indigenous groups or reservations. OBJECTIVE: We estimate COVID-19 mortality for Native Americans relative to other racial/ethnic groups and explore how state-level mortality is associated with known risk factors. METHODS: We use the Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR), adjusted for age and county, to estimate COVID-19 mortality by racial/ethnic groups for the U.S. and 10 selected states. The prevalence of risk factors is derived from the American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. RESULTS: The SMR for Native Americans greatly exceeds those for Black and Latino populations and varies enormously across states. There is a strong correlation between the share of Native Americans living on a reservation and the SMR. The SMR for Native Americans is also highly correlated with the income-poverty ratio and the prevalence of multigenerational families, crowded housing, frontline worker status, and health insurance (excluding the Indian Health Service). Risk factors associated with socioeconomic status and co-morbidities are generally more prevalent for Native Americans living on homelands, a proxy for reservation status, than for those living elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Most risk factors for COVID-19 are disproportionately high among Native Americans, particularly for those living on homelands. Reservation life appears to increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality. CONTRIBUTION: We assemble and analyze a broader set of COVID-19-related risk factors for Native Americans than previous studies, a critical step toward understanding the exceptionally high COVID-19 death rates in this population.",Katherine Leggat-Barr; Fumiya Uchikoshi; Noreen Goldman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253515,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253515,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
38,Limits of lockdown: characterising essential contacts during strict physical distancing,"COVID-19 has exposed health inequalities within countries and globally. The fundamental determining factor behind an individuals risk of infection is the number of social contacts they make. In many countries, physical distancing measures have been implemented to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2, reducing social contacts to a minimum. Characterising unavoidable social contacts is key for understanding the inequalities behind differential risks and planning vaccination programmes. We utilised an existing English longitudinal birth cohort, which is broadly representative of the wider population (n=6807), to explore social contact patterns and behaviours when strict physical distancing measures were in place during the UKs first lockdown in March-May 2020. Essential workers, specifically those in healthcare, had 4.5 times as many contacts as non-essential workers [incident rate ratio = 4.42 (CI95%: 3.88-5.04)], whilst essential workers in other sectors, mainly teaching and the police force had three times as many contacts [IRR = 2.84 (2.58-3.13)]. The number of individuals in a household, which is conflated by number of children, increases essential social contacts by 40%. Self-isolation effectively reduces numbers of contacts outside of the home, but not entirely. Together, these findings will aid the interpretation of epidemiological data and impact the design of effective SARS-CoV-2 control strategies, such as vaccination, testing and contact tracing.",Amy C Thomas; Leon Danon; Hannah Christensen; Kate Northstone; Daniel Smith; Emily J Nixon; Adam Trickey; Gibran Hemani; Sarah Sauchelli; Adam Finn; Nicholas J Timpson; Ellen Brooks-Pollock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253484,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253484,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
39,Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers in Kenya,"Background Few studies have assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in Africa. We report findings from a survey among HCWs in three counties in Kenya. Methods We recruited 684 HCWs from Kilifi (rural), Busia (rural) and Nairobi (urban) counties. The serosurvey was conducted between 30th July 2020 and 4th December 2020. We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. We adjusted prevalence estimates using Bayesian modeling to account for assay performance. Results Crude overall seroprevalence was 19.7% (135/684). After adjustment for assay performance seroprevalence was 20.8% (95% CI 17.5-24.4%). Seroprevalence varied significantly (p<0.001) by site: 43.8% (CI 35.8-52.2%) in Nairobi, 12.6% (CI 8.8-17.1%) in Busia and 11.5% (CI 7.2-17.6%) in Kilifi. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex and site, professional cadre was not associated with differences in seroprevalence.

We tested the hypothesis that the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests varied by time of day, suggesting variation in viral shedding by time of day. Among 30,000 clinical tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the Vanderbilt Affiliated Healthcare Network from March-June 2020, we found evidence for diurnal variation in the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, with a peak around 2pm in the afternoon and 2-fold variation over the day.

41,Is there a serum proteome signature to predict mortality in severe COVID-19 patients?,"Here we recorded serum proteome profiles of 33 COVID-19 patients admitted to respiratory and intensive care units because of respiratory failure. We received, for most patients, blood samples just after admission and at two more later timepoints. We focused on serum proteins different in abundance between the group of survivors and non-survivors and observed that a rather small panel of about a dozen proteins were significantly different in abundance between these two groups. The four structurally and functionally related type-3 cystatins AHSG, FETUB, HRG and KNG1 were all more abundant in the survivors. The family of inter--trypsin inhibitors, ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3 and ITIH4, were all found to be differentially abundant in between survivors and non-survivors, whereby ITIH1 and ITIH2 were more abundant in the survivor group and ITIH3 and ITIH4 more abundant in the non-survivors. ITIH1/ITIH2 and ITIH3/ITIH4 also did show opposite trends in protein abundance during disease progression. This panel of eight proteins, complemented with a few more, may represent a panel for mortality risk assessment and eventually even for treatment, by administration of exogenous proteins possibly aiding survival. Such administration is not unprecedented, as administration of exogenous inter--trypsin inhibitors is already used in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis and Kawasaki disease. The mortality risk panel defined here is in excellent agreement with findings in two recent COVID-19 serum proteomics studies on independent cohorts, supporting our findings. This panel may not be unique for COVID-19, as some of the proteins here annotated as mortality risk factors have previously been annotated as mortality markers in aging and in other diseases caused by different pathogens, including bacteria.",Franziska Voellmy; Henk van den Toorn; Riccardo Zenezini Chiozzi; Ottavio Zucchetti; Albetto Papi; Carlo Alberto Volta; Luisa Marracino; Francesco Vieceli Dalla Sega; Francecsca Fortini; Gianluca Campo; Marco Contoli; Savino Spadaro; Paola Rizzo; Albert J.R.

42,Awake prone position in adult nonintubated patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19:A multi-centre feasibility randomized controlled trial,"Background: The primary manifestation of Corona Virus Disease -2019 (COVID-19) is acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prone position has been shown to improve outcomes in ventilated patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The feasibility and safety of awake prone positioning and its impact on outcomes if any, in non-intubated patients with mild to moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 is unknown. Results of the observational studies published thus far in this pandemic have been conflicting. In this context, we conducted a multi-centre, parallel group, randomised controlled feasibility study on awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen. Methods: 60 patients diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID -19 pneumonia requiring 4 or more litres of oxygen to maintain a saturation of [&ge;] 92% were recruited in this study. Thirty patients each were randomised to either standard care or awake prone group. Patients randomised to the standard care were allowed to change their position as per comfort and patients randomized to the prone group were encouraged to self-prone for at least 6 hours a day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adhering to the protocol in each group. Secondary outcomes include failure of therapy leading to escalation of respiratory support, number of hours prone, maximum hours of continuous prone positioning in a day, length of stay in ICU, ICU mortality, total number of patients needing intubation and adverse events. Results: In the prone group, 43% (13 out of 30) of patients were able to self-prone for 6 or more hours a day. The median maximum prone duration per session was 2 hours. In the supine group, 47% (14 out of 30) were completely supine and 53% spent some hours in the prone position, but none exceeded 6 hours. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes between the two groups and there were no adverse events. Interpretation: Awake proning in non-intubated patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure is feasible and safe under clinical trial conditions.

43,Serum Vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 severity markers and mortality independent of visceral adiposity,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and 25-OHD levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined. METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation (including outcomes), laboratory measurements (including 25-OHD) and a thoracic computerized tomography (including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness). Low vitamin D was defined as levels <20ng/mL (<50nmol/L) and severely low (or deficient) 25-OHD as a level [&le;]12ng/mL (<30nmol/L) RESULTS: Of the 551 patients included, low 25-OHD levels were present in 45.6% and severely low levels in 10.9%. Severely low 25-OHD levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95%CI 1.24-3.58, p=0.006) but not with critical COVID-19 (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.94-0.99, p=0.042), adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat. Using model-based causal mediation analyses the increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by 25-OHD levels was partly mediated by its effect on D-dimer and cardiac ultrasensitive troponins. Notably, increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was independent of BMI and epicardial fat. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency ([&le;]12ng/mL or <30nmol/L), is independently associated with COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for visceral fat (epicardial fat thickness). Low 25-OHD may contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, increasing the risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.",Pablo Esteban Vanegas-Cedillo; Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla; Natalia Ramírez-Pedraza; Bethsabel Rodríguez-Encinas; Carolina Isabel Pérez-Carrión; María Isabel Jasso-Ávila; Jorge Valladares-Garcia; Diana Hernández-Juárez; Arsenio Vargas-Vázquez; Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa; Monica Chapa-Ibarguengoitia; Alfredo Ponce de Leon; Jose Sifuentes-Osornio; Carlos A Aguilar-Salinas; Roopa Mehta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253490,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253490,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,,True
44,Interventions to control nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study,"BackgroundEmergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants requires more efficient control measures to limit nosocomial transmission and maintain healthcare capacities during pandemic waves. The relative importance of different strategies is unknown.

MethodsWe developed an agent-based model and compared the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE), screening of healthcare workers (HCWs), contact tracing of symptomatic HCWs, and HCW cohorting on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model was fit on hospital data, assuming 90% effective PPE use in COVID-19 wards. Intervention effects on the effective reproduction number (RE), HCW absenteeism and the proportion of infected individuals among tested individuals (positivity rate) were estimated for a more transmissible variant.

FindingsIntroduction of a variant with 56% higher transmissibility increased - all other variables kept constant - RE from 0.4 to 0.65 (+63%) and nosocomial transmissions by 303%, mainly because of more transmissions caused by pre-symptomatic patients and HCWs. Compared to baseline, PPE use in all hospital wards (assuming 90% effectiveness) reduced RE by 85% and absenteeism by 57%. Screening HCWs every three days with perfect test sensitivity reduced RE by 67%, yielding a maximum test positivity rate of 5%. Screening HCWs every three or seven days assuming time-varying test sensitivities reduced RE by 9% and 3%, respectively. Contact tracing reduced RE by at least 32% and achieved higher test positivity rates than screening interventions. HCW cohorting reduced RE by 5%.

45,Age-dependent impact of the major common genetic risk factor for COVID-19 on severity and mortality,"BackgroundThere is considerable variability in COVID-19 outcomes amongst younger adults--and some of this variation may be due to genetic predisposition. We characterized the clinical implications of the major genetic risk factor for COVID-19 severity, and its age-dependent effect, using individual-level data in a large international multi-centre consortium.

MethodThe major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is a chromosome 3 locus, tagged by the marker rs10490770. We combined individual level data for 13,424 COVID-19 positive patients (N=6,689 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in nine countries to assess the association of this genetic marker with mortality, COVID-19-related complications and laboratory values. We next examined if the magnitude of these associations varied by age and were independent from known clinical COVID-19 risk factors.

FindingsWe found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1{middle dot}4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1{middle dot}2-1{middle dot}6) and COVID-19 related mortality (HR 1{middle dot}5, 95%CI 1{middle dot}3-1{middle dot}8). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] 2{middle dot}0, 95%CI 1{middle dot}6-2{middle dot}6), venous thromboembolism (OR 1{middle dot}7, 95%CI 1{middle dot}2-2{middle dot}4), and hepatic injury (OR 1{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}2-2{middle dot}0). Risk allele carriers [&le;] 60 years had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR 2{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}8-3{middle dot}9) compared to those > 60 years OR 1{middle dot}5 (95%CI 1{middle dot}3-1{middle dot}9, interaction p-value=0{middle dot}04). Amongst individuals [&le;] 60 years who died or experienced severe respiratory COVID-19 outcome, we found that 31{middle dot}8% (95%CI 27{middle dot}6-36{middle dot}2) were risk variant carriers, compared to 13{middle dot}9% (95%CI 12{middle dot}6-15{middle dot}2%) of those not experiencing these outcomes. Prediction of death or severe respiratory failure among those [&le;] 60 years improved when including the risk allele (AUC 0{middle dot}82 vs 0{middle dot}84, p=0{middle dot}016) and the prediction ability of rs10490770 risk allele was similar to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors.

InterpretationThe major common COVID-19 risk locus on chromosome 3 is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality--and these are more pronounced amongst individuals [&le;] 60 years. The effect on COVID-19 severity was similar to, or larger than most established risk factors, suggesting potential implications for clinical risk management.

46,"Mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil, February 2020 to February 2021: insights and limitations from uneven sequencing efforts","The COVID-19 pandemic has already reached approximately 110 million people and it is associated with 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Brazil is the third worst-hit country, with approximately 10.2 million cases and 250 thousand deaths. Unprecedented international efforts have been established in order to share information about epidemiology, viral evolution and transmission dynamics. However, sequencing facilities and research investments are very heterogeneous across different regions and countries across the globe. The understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology is a vital part for the development of effective strategies for public health care and disease management. This work aims to analyze the available genomes sequenced in Brazil between February 2020 and February 2021, in order to identify mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the Brazilian territory by using phylogenetics and phylodynamics analyses from high-quality genomes. We describe heterogeneous and episodic sequencing efforts, the progression of the different lineages along time, evaluating mutational spectra and frequency oscillations derived from the prevalence of novel and specific lineages across different Brazilian regions. We found at least seven major (1-7) and two minor clades (4.2 and 5.3) related to the six most prevalent Brazilian lineages and described its distribution across the Brazilian territory. The emergence and recent frequency shift of lineages (P.1 and P.2) containing mutations of concern in the spike protein (e. g., E484K, N501Y) draws attention due to their association with immune evasion and enhanced receptor binding affinity. Improvements in genomic surveillance are of paramount importance and should be extended in Brazil to better inform policy makers and enable precise evidence-based decisions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.",Vinicius Bonetti Franceschi; Patricia Aline Grohs Ferrareze; Ricardo Ariel Zimerman; Gabriela Bettella Cybis; Claudia Elizabeth Thompson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253152,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253152,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
47,Forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic integrating symptom search behavior: an infodemiology study,"BackgroundPrevious studies have suggested associations between trends of web searches and COVID-19 traditional metrics. It remains unclear whether models incorporating trends of digital searches lead to better predictions.

MethodsAn open-access web application was developed to evaluate Google Trends and traditional COVID-19 metrics via an interactive framework based on principal components analysis (PCA) and time series modelling. The app facilitates the analysis of symptom search behavior associated with COVID-19 disease in 188 countries. In this study, we selected data of eight countries as case studies to represent all continents. PCA was used to perform data dimensionality reduction, and three different time series models (Error Trend Seasonality, Autoregressive integrated moving average, and feed-forward neural network autoregression) were used to predict COVID-19 metrics in the upcoming 14 days. The models were compared in terms of prediction ability using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the first principal component (PC1). Predictive ability of models generated with both Google Trends data and conventional COVID-19 metrics were compared with those fitted with conventional COVID-19 metrics only.

FindingsThe degree of correlation and the best time-lag varied as a function of the selected country and topic searched; in general, the optimal time-lag was within 15 days. Overall, predictions of PC1 based on both searched termed and COVID-19 traditional metrics performed better than those not including Google searches (median [IQR]: 1.43 [0.74-2.36] vs. 1.78 [0.95-2.88], respectively), but the improvement in prediction varied as a function of the selected country and timeframe. The best model varied as a function of country, time range, and period of time selected. Models based on a 7-day moving average led to considerably smaller RMSE values as opposed to those calculated with raw data (median [IQR]: 0.74 [0.47-1.22] vs. 2.15 [1.55-3.89], respectively).

InterpretationThe inclusion of digital online searches in statistical models may improve the prediction of the COVID-19 epidemic.

48,Outcome of Different Therapeutic Interventions in Mild COVID-19 Patients in a Single OPD Clinic of West Bengal: A Retrospective study,"IntroductionWith over 87,273,380 cases being reported and 1,899,440 deaths worldwide as of 9th January 2021, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the worst-hit pandemic till date. Every day clinicians are bombarded with many new treatment options that claim to be better than the others.

Materials and methodsAfter screening the electronic database of COVID-19 patients retrospectively, 56 patients with mild COVID-19 infection matched the inclusion criteria and were divided into the four following groups - group having used Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), group using doxycycline (DOX) + Ivermectin (IVR) combination, group receiving only azithromycin (AZ) and, group receiving only symptomatic treatment. The studys primary objective was to see Clinical response of well-being (CRWB) reporting time after initiating treatment onset between the four different treatment arms.

ResultsCRWB did not differ between the four groups receiving four different managements (p-value 0.846). There was significant correlation between blood levels of LDH (p-value 0.001), CRP (p-value 0.03) and D-dimer (p-value 0.04) with CRWB in IVR+DOX group and, between LDH (p-value 0.001), CRP (p-value 0.01) and age (p-value 0.035) with CRWB in the symptomatic management group.

49,SARS-CoV-2 seroassay optimization and performance in a population with high background reactivity in Mali,"Serological tests are an indispensable tool to understand the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in areas where molecular diagnostics are limited. Poor assay performance may hinder the utility of these tests, including high rates of false-positivity previously reported in sub-Saharan Africa. From 312 Malian samples collected prior to 2020, we measured antibodies to the commonly tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens and four other betacoronaviruses by ELISA, and assessed functional cross-reactivity in a subset by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. We then evaluated the performance of an ELISA developed in the US, using two-antigen SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain. To optimize test performance, we compared single and two-antigen approaches using existing assay cutoffs and population-specific cutoffs for Malian control samples (positive and negative). Background reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was common in pre-pandemic samples compared to US controls (43.4% (135/311) for spike protein, 22.8% (71/312) for RBD, and 33.9% (79/233) for nucleocapsid protein). SARS-CoV-2 reactivity correlated weakly with other betacoronavirus reactivity, varied between Malian communities, and increased with age. No pre-pandemic samples demonstrated functional activity. Regardless of the cutoffs applied, specificity improved using a two-antigen approach. Test performance was optimal using a two-antigen assay with population-specific cutoffs derived from ROC curve analysis [Sensitivity: 73.9% (51.6-89.8), Specificity: 99.4% (97.7-99.9)].

52,Evolutionary and phenotypic characterization of spike mutations in a new SARS-CoV-2 Lineage reveals two Variants of Interest,"Molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 aims to monitor the appearance of new variants with the potential to change the virulence or transmissibility of the virus. During the first year of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, numerous variants with possible public health impact have emerged. We have detected two mutations in the Spike protein at amino acid positions 1163 and 1167 that have appeared independently multiple times in different genetic backgrounds, indicating they may increase viral fitness. Interestingly, the majority of these sequences appear in transmission clusters, with the genotype encoding mutations at both positions increasing in frequency more than single-site mutants. This genetic outcome that we denote as Lineage B.1.177.637, belongs to clade 20E and includes 12 additional single nucleotide polymorphisms but no deletions with respect to the reference genome (first sequence in Wuhan). B.1.177.637 appeared after the first wave of the epidemic in Spain, and subsequently spread to eight additional countries, increasing in frequency among sequences in public databases. Positions 1163 and 1167 of the Spike protein are situated in the HR2 domain, which is implicated in the fusion of the host and viral membranes. To better understand the effect of these mutations on the virus, we examined whether B.1.177.637 altered infectivity, thermal stability, or antibody sensitivity. Unexpectedly, we observed reduced infectivity of this variant relative to the ancestral 20E variant in vitro while the levels of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs did not vary significantly. In addition, we found the mutations do not impact thermal stability or antibody susceptibility in vaccinated individuals but display a moderate reduction in sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent sera from early stages of the pandemic. Altogether, this lineage could be considered a Variant of Interest (VOI), we denote VOI1163.7. Finally, we detected a sub-cluster of sequences within VOI1163.7 that have acquired two additional changes previously associated with antibody escape and it could be identified as VOI1163.7.V2. Overall, we have detected the spread of a new Spike variant that may be advantageous to the virus and whose continuous transmission poses risks by the acquisition of additional mutations that could affect pre-existing immunity.",Paula Ruiz-Rodriguez; Clara Frances-Gomez; Álvaro Chiner-Oms; Mariana G.

53,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence and determinants of six ethnic groups living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands: a population-based cross-sectional study, June-October 2020","BackgroundEthnic minorities have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, but little is known about ethnic differences in past exposure. We aimed to determine whether prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied between six ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

MethodsParticipants aged 25-79 years enrolled in a population-based prospective cohort were randomly selected within ethnic groups and invited to test for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and answer COVID-19 related questions. We estimated prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure within ethnic groups using survey-weighted logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and calendar time.

ResultsBetween June 24-October 9, 2020, we included 2497 participants. Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was comparable between ethnic-Dutch (25/498; 5.5%, 95%CI=3.2-7.9), South-Asian Surinamese (22/451; 4.8%, 95%CI=2.1-7.5), African Surinamese (22/400; 8.2%, 95%CI=3.0-13.4), Turkish (30/408; 7.8%, 95%CI=4.3-11.2) and Moroccan (32/391; 7.0%, 95%CI=4.0-9.9) participants, but higher among Ghanaians (95/327; 26.5%, 95%CI=18.7-34.4). 57.1% of SARS-CoV-2-positive participants did not suspect or were unsure of being infected, which was lowest in African Surinamese (18.2%) and highest in Ghanaians (90.5%). Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied across ethnic groups, while the most common determinant was having a household member suspected of infection. In Ghanaians, seropositivity was associated with older age, larger household sizes, living with small children, leaving home to work and attending religious services.

ConclusionsNo remarkable differences in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were observed between the largest ethnic groups in Amsterdam after the first wave of infections. The higher infection seroprevalence observed among Ghanaians, which passed mostly unnoticed, warrants wider prevention efforts and opportunities for non-symptom-based testing.",Liza Coyer; Anders Boyd; Janke Schinkel; Charles Agyemang; Henrike Galenkamp; Anitra D.

The Universal rule requires that Herd immunity begin when just 25% of the population is vaccinated. With the anticipated 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of the Biden administration, Herd immunity may be imminent in the US.

The Universal rule promotes a temporary stasis with continuing infections and hospitalizations and becomes a barrier to runaway infections, making it practically impossible to reach Herd immunity, as Sweden discovered.

56,Process evaluation of the development and remote recruitment for Essential Coaching for Every Mother during COVID-19,"BackgroundWith the sudden decrease in in-person support and increase in perinatal mental health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, innovative strategies, such as mHealth, are more important than ever. This study has two objectives: (1) to describe the modification of Essential Coaching for Every Mother during the coronavirus pandemic, and (2) to describe the process evaluation of recruitment and retention of pregnant and postpartum women for a pre-post intervention study.

MethodsFor objective 1, modified messages were piloted with mothers and postpartum healthcare providers simultaneously. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of 10 participants from the original development study. For objective 2, three methods were used for recruitment: social media, posters in hospital, and media outreach. First time mothers were eligible for enrollment antenatally (37+ weeks) and postnatally (<3 weeks). Eligibility screening occurred remotely via text message with participants initiating contact. Data were collected via TextIt and REDCap. Outcomes were days to recruit 75 participants, eligibility vs. ineligibility rates, dropout and exclusion reasons, survey completion rates, perinatal timing of enrollment, and recruitment sources.

ResultsFor objective 1, three mothers (M age=30.67 years) and seven healthcare providers (M age = 46.0 years) participated in the modification of the messages. Participants felt the messages were appropriate and relevant related to changes in postpartum care during the coronavirus pandemic. Nine messages were modified related to coronavirus and five messages were added to the program. For objective 2, recruitment ran July 15th-September 19th (67 days) with 200 screened and 88 enrolled, 70% antenatally. It took 50 days to enroll 75 participants. Mothers recruited antenatally (n=53) were more likely to receive all intervention message (68% vs. 19%). Mothers recruited postnatally (n=35) missed more messages on average (13.8 vs. 6.4). Participants heard about the study through family/friends (31%), news (20%), Facebook groups (16%), Facebook ads (14%), posters (12%), or other ways (7%).

ConclusionAntenatal recruitment resulted in participants enrolling earlier and receiving more of the study messages.

57,"Evaluating the impacts of tiered restrictions introduced in England, during October and December 2020 on COVID-19 cases: A synthetic control study.","BackgroundIn 2020, a second wave of COVID-19 cases unevenly affected places in England leading to the introduction of a tiered system of controls with different geographical areas subject to different levels of restrictions. Whilst previous research has examined the impact of national lockdowns on transmission, there has been limited research examining the marginal effect of differences in localised restrictions or how these effects vary between socioeconomic contexts. We therefore examined how Tier 3 restrictions in England implemented between October-December 2020, which included additional restrictions on the hospitality sector and people meeting outdoors affected COVID-19 case rates, compared to Tier 2 restrictions, and how these effects varied by level of deprivation.

MethodsWe used data on weekly reported COVID-19 cases for 7201 neighbourhoods in England and adjusted these for changing case-detection rates to provide an estimate of weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in each neighbourhood. We identified those areas that entered Tier 3 restrictions at two time points in October and December, and constructed a synthetic control group of similar places that had entered Tier 2 restrictions, using calibration weights to match them on a wide range of covariates that may influence transmission. We then compared the change in weekly infections between those entering Tier 3 to the synthetic control group to estimate the proportional reduction of cases resulting from Tier 3 restrictions compared to Tier 2 restrictions, over a 4-week period. We further used interaction analysis to estimate whether this effect differed based on the level of socioeconomic deprivation in each neighbourhood and whether effects were modified by the prevalence of a new more infectious variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) in each area.

ResultsThe introduction of Tier 3 restrictions in October and December was associated with a 14% (95% CI 10% to 19%) and 20% (95% CI 13% to 29%) reduction in infections respectively, compared to the rates expected if only Tier 2 restrictions had been in place in those areas. We found that effects were similar across levels of deprivation and limited evidence that Tier 3 restrictions had a greater effect in areas where the new more infectious variant was more prevalent.

InterpretationAdditional restrictions on hospitality and meeting outdoors introduced in Tier 3 areas in England had a moderate effect on transmission and these restrictions did not appear to increase inequalities, having a similar impact across areas with differing levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Where transmission risks vary between geographical areas a tiered approach of local restrictions on outdoor mixing and hospitality can contribute to control of SARS-CoV-2 and is unlikely to increases inequalities in transmission.",Xingna Zhang; Gwilym Owen; Mark Green; Iain Buchan; Ben Barr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253165,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the frequency of lifestyles, physical activity and sleep characteristics, as well as changes in eating habits in the Peruvian population during COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA Cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. We analyzed adults from Peru between July to August 2020 based on an online self-administered questionnaire divided into sociodemographic, anthropometrics and COVID-19 diagnostic reported, lifestyle habits and frequency of consumption of foods.

FindingsDuring confinement by COVID-19, 1176 participants were studied, 39% were student, 37.5% were workers and 46% were assert not to work. The population asserted gain weight (1 to 3 Kg) and 35.7% were overweight.

59,"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Juba, South Sudan: a population-based study","BackgroundRelatively few COVID-19 cases and deaths have been reported through much of sub-Saharan Africa, including South Sudan, although the extent of SARS-CoV-2 spread remains unclear due to weak surveillance systems and few population-representative serosurveys.

MethodsWe conducted a representative household-based cross-sectional serosurvey in Juba, South Sudan. We quantified IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain and estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model accounting for test performance.

ResultsWe recruited 2,214 participants from August 10 to September 11, 2020 and 22.3% had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers above levels in pre-pandemic samples. After accounting for waning antibody levels, age, and sex, we estimated that 38.5% (32.1 - 46.8) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. For each RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 case, 104 (87-126) infections were unreported. Background antibody reactivity was higher in pre-pandemic samples from Juba compared to Boston, where the serological test was validated. The estimated proportion of the population infected ranged from 30.1% to 60.6% depending on assumptions about test performance and prevalence of clinically severe infections.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 has spread extensively within Juba. Validation of serological tests in sub-Saharan African populations is critical to improve our ability to use serosurveillance to understand and mitigate transmission.",Kirsten E.

Here, we sought to examine this issue by analyzing the serological response observed in 241 KTRs after a first vaccine injection. Our results indicate that KTRs have a weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, ultimately resulting in a low seroconversion rate (26/241, 10.8%).

61,Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins to viral pathogenicity in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, it is estimated that over 113 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 2.5 million human deaths have been recorded worldwide. Currently, three vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use only. However much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2, where we individually removed viral 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 ORF proteins, and characterized these recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF deficient ({Delta}ORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild-type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of {Delta}ORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the {Delta}ORF rSARS-CoV-2 identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while {Delta}ORF7a, {Delta}ORF7b and {Delta}ORF8 rSARS-CoV-2 induced comparable pathology to rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19.

IMPORTANCEDespite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remains elusive. Our study aims to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in viral pathogenesis and disease outcome, and develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse genetics system to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as the foundation to generate attenuated forms of the virus to develop live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434696,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434696,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,False

63,Maximisation of open hospital capacity under shortage of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"MotiveThe Covid-19 pandemic has led to the novel situation that hospitals must prioritise staff for a vaccine rollout while there is acute shortage of the vaccine. In spite of the availability of guidelines from state agencies, there is partial confusion about what an optimal rollout plan is. This study investigates effects in a hospital model under different rollout schemes.

MethodsA simulation model is implemented in VBA and studied for parameter variation. The implemented code is available as open access supplement.

Main resultsA rollout scheme assigning vaccine doses to staff primarily by staffs pathogen exposure maximises the predicted open hospital capacity when compared to a rollout based on hierarchical prioritisation. The effect increases under resource scarcity and increasing disease activity. Nursing staff benefits most from an exposure focused rollout.

ConclusionsThe model employs SARS-CoV-2 parameters; nonetheless, effects observable in the model are transferable to other infectious diseases.

64,Quantified Flu: an individual-centered approach to gaining sickness-related insights from wearable data,"BackgroundWearables have been used widely for monitoring health in general and recent research results show that they can be used for predicting infections based on physiological symptoms. So far the evidence has been generated in large, population-based settings. In contrast, the Quantified Self and Personal Science communities are comprised of people interested in learning about themselves individually using their own data, often gathered via wearable devices.

ObjectiveWe explore how a co-creation process involving a heterogeneous community of personal science practitioners can develop a collective self-tracking system to monitor symptoms of infection alongside wearable sensor data.

MethodsWe engaged into a co-creation and design process with an existing community of personal science practitioners, jointly developing a working prototype of an online tool to perform symptom tracking. In addition to the iterative creation of the prototype (started on March 16, 2020), we performed a netnographic analysis, investigating the process of how this prototype was created in a decentralized and iterative fashion.

ResultsThe Quantified Flu prototype allows users to perform daily symptom reporting and is capable of visualizing those symptom reports on a timeline together with the resting heart rate, body temperature and respiratory rate as measured by wearable devices. We observe a high level of engagement, with over half of the 92 users that engaged in the symptom tracking becoming regular users, reporting over three months of data each. Furthermore, our netnographic analysis highlights how the current Quantified Flu prototype is a result of an interactive and continuous co-creation process in which new prototype releases spark further discussions of features and vice versa.

65,Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of respiratory Gram-negative bacterial isolates from COVID-19 patients in Switzerland,"BackgroundBacterial superinfections associated with COVID-19 are common in ventilated ICU patients and impact morbidity and lethality. However, the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to the manifestation of bacterial infections in these patients has yet to be elucidated.

MethodsWe collected 70 Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients in Zurich, Switzerland between March and May 2020. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF; antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by EUCAST disk diffusion and CLSI broth microdilution assays. Selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.

ResultsP. aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%) comprised the two largest etiologic groups. Drug resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates was high for piperacillin/tazobactam (65.6%), cefepime (56.3%), ceftazidime (46.9%) and meropenem (50.0%). Enterobacterales isolates showed slightly lower levels of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (32%), ceftriaxone (32%), and ceftazidime (36%). All P. aeruginosa isolates and 92% of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, with apramycin found to provide best-in-class coverage. Genotypic analysis of consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates in one patient revealed a frameshift mutation in the transcriptional regulator nalC that coincided with a phenotypic shift in susceptibility to {beta}-lactams and quinolones.

ConclusionsConsiderable levels of antimicrobial resistance may have contributed to the manifestation of bacterial superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients, and may in some cases mandate consecutive adaptation of antibiotic therapy. High susceptibility to amikacin and apramycin suggests that aminoglycosides may remain an effective second-line treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, provided efficacious drug exposure in lungs can be achieved.",Marina Gysin; Claudio Tirso Acevedo; Klara Haldimann; Elias Bodendoerfer; Frank Imkamp; Karl Bulut; Philipp Karl Buehler; Silvio Daniel Brugger; Katja Becker; Sven N.

As part of the study, we examined samples from 106 patients who had just been admitted to the hospital, who had undergone quantitative RT-PCR and assessment of viability of SARS-CoV-2 using cell culture. Sensitivity was 0.786 (0.492-0.953) for SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag and 1 (0.768- 1) for Biocredit COVID-19 Ag. Specificity of rapid tests was significantly higher than that of RT-PCR and was 0.663 (0.557-0.758) and 0.674 (0.568-0.768) for SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag and Biocredit COVID-19 Ag versus 0.304 (0.213-0.409) obtained for PCR.

67,Higher viral load drives infrequent SARS-CoV-2 transmission between asymptomatic residence hall roommates,"In 2019-2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread to over 200 countries in less than six months. To understand the basis of this aggressive spread, it is essential to determine the transmission rate and define the factors that increase the risk of transmission. One complication is the large fraction of asymptomatic cases, particularly in young populations: these individuals have viral loads indistinguishable from symptomatic people and do transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they often go undetected. As university students living in residence halls commonly share a small living space with roommates, some schools established regular, high density testing programs to mitigate on-campus spread. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal testing data of residence hall students at the University of Colorado Boulder. We observed that students in single rooms were infected at a lower rate than students in multiple occupancy rooms. However, this was not due to high rates of transmission between roommates, which only occurred approximately 20% of the time. Since these cases were usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, this provides further evidence for asymptomatic transmission. Notably, individuals who likely transmitted to their roommates had an average viral load [~]6.5 times higher than individuals who did not. Although students were moved to separate isolation rooms after diagnosis, there was no difference in time to isolation between these cases with or without transmission. This analysis argues that inter-roommate transmission occurs in a minority of cases in university residence halls and provides strong correlative evidence that viral load can be proportional to the probability of transmission.",Kristen K Bjorkman; Tassa K Saldi; Erika Lasda; Leisha Conners Bauer; Jennifer Kovarik; Patrick K Gonzales; Morgan R Fink; Kimngang L Tat; Cole R Hager; Jack C Davis; Christopher D Ozeroff; Gloria R Brisson; Daniel B Larremore; Leslie A Leinwand; Matthew B McQueen; Roy Parker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253147,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253147,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
68,Global association of obesity and COVID-19 death rates,"ImportanceCOVID-19 was responsible for an enormous global death toll with large variation among countries.

ObjectiveTo examine the possible impact of obesity on COVID-19 death rates.

DesignMeasure associations between obesity rates in 2016 and COVID-19 deaths/million population through 2/25/2021, across countries.

SettingGlobal

Participants167 countries for which obesity and death data were available, grouped by population size, with multiples of 10 countries in each of 8 groups plus a group including all 57 countries with obesity rates <15%.

Outcome and measuresUsing Excel, COVID-19 deaths/million were regressed on the obesity rate for each country, based on obesity being a key factor in COVID hospitalizations and deaths. Using the least squares formula for the best fit for each model, R2, components of the formula, and the percentage of world population represented, were recorded for each group.

ResultsObesity rates ranged from 2.1% to 37.9% and death rates ranged from 0.4/million to 1,892/million for groups representing up to 91% of global population. Results for the 8 population groups had R2 from 0.30 to 0.90 with slopes of the fitted line ranging from 27.9-51.0. Countries with obesity rates <15% had consistently low death rates ([&le;]233/million), R2 of 0.003 and slope of the line=1.01.

ConclusionsFor most countries about one-third of the difference in COVID death rates was due to obesity while in countries with obesity <15%, consistently low death rates were not associated with obesity.

Immunoassays performances have to be accurately evaluated and correlated with neutralizing antibodies to be used as a surrogate measure of neutralizing activity. We investigate the analytical and clinical performance of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay, automated on a high throughput platform, and the correlation of the antibodies (Ab) levels with the plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT50) Ab titers.

MethodsA series of 546 samples were evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay (Snibe diagnostics), including 171 negative and 168 positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects and a further group of 207 subjects of the COVID-19 family clusters follow-up cohort.

ResultsAssay precision was acceptable at low and medium levels; linearity was excellent in all the measurement range. Considering specimens collected after 14 days post symptoms onset, overall sensitivity and specificity were 99.0% and 92.5%, respectively. A total of 281 leftover samples results of the PRNT50 test were available. An elevated correlation was obtained between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay and the PRNT50 titer at univariate (rho = 0.689) and multivariate (rho = 0.712) analyses.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated represents a challenge for health systems that had to quickly respond developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In the present work, we developed an ""In House"" ELISA with high sensitivity (92.2 %), specificity (100%) and precision (93.9%), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.991, rendering the assay as an excellent serological test to correctly discriminate between SARS-COv-2 infected and non-infected individuals and study population seroprevalence. Among 758 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the province of Tucuman, Argentina, we found a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5048 between antibodies elicited against the RBD and the nucleocapsid (N) antigen. Additionally, 33.6% of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 displayed mild levels of RBD-IgG antibodies, while 19% of the patients showed high antibody titers. Interestingly, patients with SARS-COV-2 infection over 60 years old elicited significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies against RBD compared to younger ones, while no difference was found between women and men. Surprisingly, individuals from a high altitude village displayed statistically significant higher and longer lasting anti-RBD antibodies compared to those from a city at a lower altitude, suggesting that a hypobaric hypoxia-adapted mechanism may act as a protective factor for COVID-19.

71,A Recovery Algorithm and Pooling Designs for One-Stage Noisy Group Testing under the Probabilistic Framework,"Group testing saves time and resources by testing each pre-assigned group instead of each individual, and one-stage group testing emerged as essential for cost-effectively controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the practical challenge of adjusting pooling designs based on infection rate has not been systematically addressed. In particular, there are both theoretical interests and practical motivation to analyze one-stage group testing at finite, practical problem sizes, rather than asymptotic ones, under noisy, rather than perfect tests, and when the number of positives is randomly distributed, rather than fixed.

Here, we study noisy group testing under the probabilistic framework by modeling the infection vector as a random vector with Bernoulli entries. Our main contributions include a practical one-stage group testing protocol guided by maximizing pool entropy and a maximum-likelihood recovery algorithm under the probabilistic framework.

Here, we use an empirical proximity network of college freshmen 10, ascertained using smartphone Bluetooth, to simulate the spread of the virus. We investigate the role of testing, isolation, mask wearing, and social distancing in the presence of implementation challenges and imperfect compliance. Here we show that while frequent testing can drastically reduce spread if mask wearing and social distancing are not widely adopted, testing has limited impact if they are ubiquitous. Furthermore, even moderate levels of immunity can significantly reduce new infections, especially when combined with other interventions. Our findings suggest that while testing and isolation are powerful tools, they have limited benefit if other interventions are widely adopted.

74,Rapid screening for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in clinical and environmental samples using nested RT-PCR assays targeting key mutations of the Spike protein,"New SARS-CoV-2 mutations are constantly emerging, raising concerns of increased transmissibility, virulence or escape from host immune response.

We describe a nested RT-PCR assay ([~]1500 bps) to detect multiple key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the three Variants of Concern (VOCs) 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20J/501Y.V3 (Brazil), as well as the 20E.EU1 variant (Spain), the CAL.20C recently identified in California, and the mink-associated variant (GR, lineage B.1.1.298). Prior to application to field samples, the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage, where the amplification of long fragments is problematic, two short nested RT-PCR assays ([~]300 bps) were also designed, targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay.

The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples, including 7 fully-sequenced viral isolates from swab samples and 34 urban wastewater samples, some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported.

The long assay successfully amplified all the previously characterized viral isolates, allowing the correct identification of variants 20I/501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs (UK and Brazilian variant) and of other variant (Spanish) were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20J/501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters, highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity.

The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest.

75,Therapeutic Anticoagulation in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19-Preliminary Report,"BackgroundThrombosis may contribute to morbidity and mortality in Covid-19. We hypothesized that therapeutic anticoagulation would improve outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19.

MethodsWe conducted an open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized, clinical trial. Patients with severe Covid-19, defined as the requirement for organ support with high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, vasopressors, or inotropes, were randomized to receive therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin or pharmacological thromboprophylaxis as per local usual care. The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21.

ResultsTherapeutic anticoagulation met the pre-defined criteria for futility in patients with severe Covid-19. The primary outcome was available for 1,074 participants (529 randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation and 545 randomized to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis). Median organ support-free days were 3 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and 5 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio 0.87, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.70-1.08, posterior probability of futility [odds ratio<1.2] 99.8%). Hospital survival was comparable between groups (64.3% vs. 65.3%, adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% CrI 0.67-1.16). Major bleeding occurred in 3.1% of patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and 2.4% of patients assigned to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

ConclusionsIn patients with severe Covid-19, therapeutic anticoagulation did not improve hospital survival or days free of organ support compared to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

76,Model Based Estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 Immunization Level in Austria and Consequences for Herd Immunity Effects,"Several systemic factors indicate, that worldwide herd immunity against COVID-19 will probably not be achieved in 2021. Vaccination programs are limited by availability of doses, the number of people already infected is still too low to have a disease preventing impact and new emerging variants of the virus seem to partially neglect developed antibodies from previous infections. Nevertheless, after one year of COVID-19 observing high numbers of reported cases in most European countries, we might expect that the immunization level should have an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We used an agent-based simulation model to reproduce the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria to estimate the immunization level of the population as of February 2021. We ran several simulations of an uncontrolled epidemic wave with varying initial immunization scenarios to assess the effect on the effective reproduction number. We also used a classic differential equation SIR-model to cross-validate the simulation model. As of February 2021, 14.7% of the Austrian population has been affected by a SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes a 9% reduction of the effective reproduction number and a 24.7% reduction of the prevalence peak compared to a fully susceptible population. This estimation is now recomputed on a regular basis to publish model based analysis of immunization level in Austria also including the fast growing effects of vaccination programs. This provides substantial information for decision makers to evaluate the necessity of NPI-measures based on the estimated impact of natural and vaccinated immunization.",Martin Richard Bicher; Claire Rippinger; Günter Richard Schneckenreither; Nadine Weibrecht; Christoph Urach; Melanie Zechmeister; Dominik Brunmeir; Wolfgang Huf; Niki Popper,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253251,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253251,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
77,"Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated risk factors among frontline health care workers in Paris, France: the SEROCOV prospective cohort study","BackgroundWith the COVID-19 pandemic, documenting whether health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and identifying risk factors is of major concern.

MethodsIn this multicenter prospective cohort study, HCWs from frontline departments were included in March and April 2020 and followed for 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed at month 0 (M0), M1, and M3 and RT-PCR in case of symptoms. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Risk factors of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 were identified by multivariate logistic regression.

ResultsAmong 1,062 HCWs (median [interquartile range] age, 33 [28-42] years; 758 [71.4%] women; 321 [30.2%] physicians), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 was 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [12.5; 16.9]). Risk factors were the working department specialty, with increased risk for intensive care units (odds ratio 1.80, 95%CI [0.38; 8.58]), emergency departments (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and infectious diseases departments (4.22 [0.92; 18.28]); active smoking was associated with reduced risk (0.36 [0.21; 0.63]). Age, sex, professional category, number of years of experience in the job or department, and public transportation use were not significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3.

ConclusionThe rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in frontline HCWs was 14.6% at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in Paris and occurred mainly early. The study argues for an origin of professional in addition to private life contamination and therefore including HCWs in the first-line vaccination target population. It also highlights that smokers were at lower risk.

79,"Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Arab Emirates reveals novel virus mutation, patterns of co-infection and tissue specific host responses","BackgroundThe United Arab Emirates is a major business hub with substantial amount of international travel. Like many other countries, it was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic since late January 2020, with recurring waves of infection. This study aimed at combining genomic and epidemiological data to unravel the source of SARS-CoV-2 introduction, transmission and evolution in the country.

MethodsWe performed meta-transcriptomic sequencing of 1,067 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from qRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients in Abu Dhabi, UAE, between May 9th and June 29th 2020. We investigated the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of the viral population and analyzed the infection and transmission potential of novel genomic clusters. Within-host SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation was analyzed to determine the occurrence and prevalence of multiple infections. Finally, we evaluated innate host responses during the prolonged period of local infection.

ResultsAll globally known SARS-CoV-2 clades were identified within the UAE sequenced strains, with a higher occurrence of European and East Asian clades. We defined 5 subclades based on 11 unique genetic variants within the UAE strains, which were associated with no significantly different viral loads. Multiple infection of different SARS-CoV-2 strains was observed for at least 5% of the patients. We also discovered an enrichment of cytosine-to-uracil mutation among the viral population collected from the nasopharynx, that is different from the adenosine-to-inosine change previously observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. This observation is accompanied with an upregulation of APOBEC4, an under-studied putative cytidine-uridine editing enzyme in the infected nasopharynx.

ConclusionsThe genomic epidemiological and molecular biological knowledge obtained in the study provides new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission.

80,COVID-19: Optimal Allocation of Ventilator Supply under Uncertainty and Risk,"This study presents a new risk-averse multi-stage stochastic epidemics-ventilator-logistics compartmental model to address the resource allocation challenges of mitigating COVID-19. This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.",Xuecheng Yin; I.

81,Immune response during lactation after anti-SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine,"ImportanceData regarding efficacy and safety of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during lactation is needed to address vaccination guidelines, ease vaccine hesitancy concerns, and inform public health strategies for this population.

ObjectiveTo determine whether anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines administered during lactation illicit an immune response or the transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies into human milk.

DesignPlasma and milk samples were collected from a prospective cohort of lactating individuals who received the mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 and from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 infection.

SettingAmbulatory or during postpartum hospitalization.

ParticipantsWe report results from lactating participants who received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna, n=9) or the BNT162b2 (Pfizer, n=14) vaccine or recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=3).

Interventions and ExposuresAnti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273) or natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Plasma and milk samples were collected from lactating individuals before first vaccine dose, on the day of the second dose, and 4 weeks after the second dose. Maternal plasma was evaluated for vaccine-derived IgM and IgG antibodies. Human milk was evaluated by ELISA for vaccine-induced IgA antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsTwenty-three lactating individuals were recruited for this study. Levels of IgG and IgM were significantly increased in plasma samples on the day of the second vaccine dose (post vaccine 1), when compared to pre-vaccine samples. In addition, plasma IgG levels 4 weeks after second vaccine dose were significantly higher than plasma IgG levels pre-vaccine or on the day of the second dose. In addition, our results show transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgA antibodies to human milk, 3-4 weeks after each dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273). The levels of anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA antibody in milk of vaccinated individuals were not significantly different from levels among participants who experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions and RelevanceAdministration of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during lactation leads to increased anti-SARS-CoV2 IgM and IgG levels in the plasma of lactating mothers and increased anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA levels in human milk. Lactating women who receive the vaccine should continue breastfeeding their infant human milk to allow continuing transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies to the neonate. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of these vaccines on lactation outcomes and infant health.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the immunologic response to anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines during lactation and does vaccination induce secretion of IgA antibodies into human milk?

FindingsIn a cohort of 23 lactating individuals who were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found significantly increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgM antibodies in plasma, as well as anti-SARS-CoV2 IgA in human milk.

82,The impact of the UK's first COVID-19 lockdown on rates of violence and aggression on psychiatric inpatient wards,"AimsInpatient life in UK mental health hospitals was profoundly altered during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed whether these changes impacted the rate of violent and aggressive incidents across acute adult wards and psychiatric intensive care units in a South London NHS Mental Health Trust during the first UK lockdown.

MethodsWe used an interrupted time series analysis to assess whether the rate of violent and aggressive incidents changed during the lockdown period from 23rd March 2020 to 15th June 2020. We used a quasi-poisson general additive model to model the weekly rate of violent incidents as a function of a seasonal trend, time trend, and impact of lockdown, using data from 1st January 2017 to 27th September 2020.

ResultsThere was a 35% increase in the rate of incidents of violence and aggression [IR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.58, p < 0.001] between March 23rd 2020 and June 15th 2020. In addition, there was strong evidence of temporal (p < 0.001) and seasonal trends (p < 0.001).

83,Acceptability of contact management and care of simple cases of COVID-19 at home: a mixed-method study in Senegal,"IntroductionIn mid-2020, due to the health system challenges from increased COVID-19 cases, the Ministry of Health and Social Action in Senegal opted for contact management and care of simple cases at home. The studys objective was to determine the acceptability of contact management, home care of simple cases of COVID-19, and its associated factors.

MethodThis was a sequential mixed-method study. We collected data from June 11, 2020, to July 10, 2020, for the quantitative survey (N=813) and from August 24 to September 16, 2020, for the qualitative survey (N=30). We carried out a sampling strategy using marginal quotas at the national level. We collected data using a structured questionnaire in a telephone interview for the quantitative survey and using an interview guide formulated from the quantitative surveys initial results for the qualitative data. We assessed acceptability using binomial logistic regression combined with content analysis.

ResultsThe care of simple cases of COVID-19 at home was well accepted (78.5%). This result was justified for some (saturation of the health system) but not for others (risk of contamination). The use of home contact management was less accepted (51.4%), with risk limitation as the main reason given. The acceptability of home-based care for simple cases was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.55 [95%CI: 1.04,2.28]), regular research into COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.12 [95%CI: 1.45,3.12]), belief in the existence of treatment (ORaj: 1.82 [95%CI: 1.19,2.83]), and confidence in institutional information (ORaj: 2.10 [95%CI: 1.43,3.10]). The acceptability of home-based contact management was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.77 [95%CI: 1.27,2.48]), regular research for information on COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.39 [95%CI: 1.76,3.26]), and confidence in the government in the fight against the epidemic (ORaj: 1.51 [95%CI: 1.10,2.08]).

ConclusionRegular information on the disease, knowledge of its mode of transmission and trust in institutions are factors in accepting COVID-19 management at the community level.

84,An Extended COVID-19 Epidemiological Model with Vaccination and Multiple Interventions for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK,"There has been a second outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the UK in 2020. In this situation, the UK re-implemented the lockdown intervention strategy. Different from the first COVID outbreak, the second outbreak is accompanied by two new situations: 1) There are at least three new variant strains in the UK and they are more infectious than the original strain. The mutant strain considered in the experimental simulation accounts for the majority of all strains of the mutant infection in the UK. 2) The official start of a vaccination programme in the UK started in mid-December 2020. As the date for lifting the third lockdown approaches, what kind of intervention measures will the UK continue to take: curb the spread of the COVID epidemic, reduce medical needs and allow people to return to normal life and revitalize the national economy as quickly as possible. Targeting at this problem, this article conduct a feasibility study by defining the mathematical model SEMCVRD (Susceptible [S], Exposed [E] (infected but asymptomatic), Mild [M] and Critical [C] (mild cases, severe and critical cases), [V] (vaccinated), Recovered [R] and Deceased [D]), which is expanded the traditional SEIR (Susceptible [S], Exposed [E], Infectious [I], Recovered [R]) model by adding two key features: the mixed infection of the mutant strain and the original strain and the addition of a new group who have been vaccinated. The model uses a public data set for fitting and evaluation. The dataset contains daily new infections, new deaths and daily vaccination in the UK from February 2020 to February 2021. Based on the simulation results, the following content was found : 1) There are simulated the mixed infection of the new mutant virus and the original virus in the UK. Under the assumption that the vaccine is effective against the new virus, continuing to promote the injection of the vaccine in society can effectively inhibit the spread and infection of the new mutant virus. Predicting that if UK could continuously implement insensitive suppression, COVID-19 epidemic would be able to control by 9th April 2021 and would be nearly ended by 1st May 2020. 2) With the increasing number of people vaccinated and immunized against the virus, the lifting of the third lockdown in the UK is coming. Using a phased and progressive lifting intervention strategy with an intensity of 3 is our best choice at present. Under this strategy, on 30th June 2021, the total number of infections in the UK will be limited to 4.2 million and the total number of deaths in the UK is 135 thousand. If the lockdown is lifted directly, the total number of infections in the UK will increase to 8 million and the total number of deaths in the UK will be 279 thousand on 30th June 2021. It can be seen from the above that our strategy compared to directly lifting the lockdown can greatly reduce the total number of infections and deaths. People can return to normal life and social distancing after four months. The epidemic will nearly end in 6th June 2021 (The sign of the end: the number of new infections per day is less than 1,000 and the number of new deaths per day is less than 35). In addition, according to our prediction, under this kind of intervention, the UK will not experience a shortage of medical resources as it did in the first half of 2020. 3) In the case that it is possible to provide people with 600 thousand vaccinations(double the quantity now provided) every day, a higher intensity (intensity 5) Phase intervention strategy can be trying to nearly end the epidemic earlier (25th May 2021) and restore peoples normal life and social distance.",Shuhao Zhang; Gaoshan Bi; Yun Yang; Jun Qi; Shujun Li; Xuxin Mao; Ruoling Peng; Po Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252748,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21252748,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
85,A phase 2 study of the inhaled pan-JAK inhibitor TD-0903 in severe COVID-19: Part 1,"BackgroundLung-targeted anti-inflammatory therapy could potentially improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The novel inhaled pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor TD-0903 was designed to optimise delivery to the lungs while limiting systemic exposure. Here, we report results from the completed Part 1 of a 2-part phase 2 trial (NCT04402866) in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19.

MethodsPart 1 explored 3 doses of TD-0903 (1, 3, and 10 mg once-daily for 7 days) and placebo in a randomised, double-blind, ascending-dose study. Each dose cohort comprised 8 hospitalized patients (6:2 TD-0903:placebo) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen and receiving background standard-of-care therapy. Key objectives included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; clinical outcomes were also explored. Data were summarised as descriptive statistics.

ResultsTwenty-five patients were randomised to receive TD-0903 1 mg (n = 6), 3 mg (n = 7), 10 mg (n = 6), or placebo (n = 6). Almost all patients (92%) received background dexamethasone; 3 (12%) received remdesivir. TD-0903 was generally well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. Low plasma concentrations of TD-0903 were observed at all doses. Clinically favourable numerical trends in patients receiving TD-0903 vs placebo included improved 8-point clinical status, shortened hospitalisation, improved oxygenation, and fewer deaths.

ConclusionsIn Part 1 of this phase 2 trial, the novel inhaled JAK inhibitor TD-0903 showed potential for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.

88,Development and validation of a clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of severe COVID-19,"Age, sex, and comorbidities are known risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are frequently considered independently and without accurate knowledge of the magnitude of their effects on risk. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk of severe COVID-19 have appeared in the literature, but their application in predictive risk testing has not been validated. Reliance on age and sex alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will fail to accurately quantify risk. Here, we report the development and validation of a clinical and genetic model to predict risk of severe COVID-19 using confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive participants from the UK Biobank. Our new model out-performed an age and sex model and had excellent discrimination and was well calibrated in the validation dataset. We also report validation studies of our prototype model and polygenic risk scores based on 8-SNP and 6-SNP panels identified in the literature. Accurate prediction of individual risk will be important in regions where vaccines are not widely available or where people refuse or are disqualified from vaccination, especially given uncertainty about the extent of infection transmission among vaccinated people and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",Gillian S Dite; Nicholas M Murphy; Richard Allman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253237,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253237,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
89,Wastewater Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 across 40 U.S. states,"Wastewater-based disease surveillance is a promising approach for monitoring community outbreaks. Here we describe a nationwide campaign to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater of 159 counties in 40 U.S. states, covering 13% of the U.S. population from February 18 to June 2, 2020. Out of 1,751 total samples analyzed, 846 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with overall viral concentrations declining from April to May. Wastewater viral titers were consistent with, and appeared to precede, clinical COVID-19 surveillance indicators, including daily new cases. Wastewater surveillance had a high detection rate (>80%) of SARS-CoV-2 when the daily incidence exceeded 13 per 100,000 people. Detection rates were positively associated with wastewater treatment plant catchment size. To our knowledge, this work represents the largest-scale wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 monitoring campaign to date, encompassing a wide diversity of wastewater treatment facilities and geographic locations.

90,The BioNTech / Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 induces class-switched SARS-CoV-2-specific plasma cells and potential memory B cells as well as IgG and IgA serum and IgG saliva antibodies upon the first immunization,"To treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that enters the body through the respiratory tract, different vaccines in particular against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein have been developed or are in the development process. For the BioNTech / Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, which is injected twice, protection against COVID-19 has been described for the first weeks after the second vaccination. The underlying mechanisms of defense and the long-term effectiveness of this vaccine against COVID-19 are currently under investigation.

In addition to the induction of systemic antibodies (Abs), Ab responses in the respiratory tract would help to form a first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, protection depends on Fab-part-dependent neutralizing capacities, however, Fc-part-mediated effector mechanisms might also be important. Long-term defense would be based on the induction of long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells (PCs) and memory B cells.

Here, we established different assays to analyze anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG and IgA Abs in blood serum and saliva as well as SARS-CoV-2-S1-reactive IgG and IgA PCs and potential memory B cells in the blood of individuals upon their first immunization with BNT162b2.

We show that the vaccine induces in particular anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG1 and IgG3 as well as IgA1 and in some individuals also IgG2 and IgA2 serum Abs. In the saliva, we found no anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgA, but instead IgG Abs. Furthermore, we found SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgG+ blood PCs and potential memory B cells as well as SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgA+ PCs and/or potential memory B cells in some individuals.

Our data suggest that the vaccine induces a promising CD4+ T cell-dependent systemic IgG1 and IgG3 Ab response with IgG+ PCs and potential memory B cells. In addition to the systemic IgG response, the systemic IgA and saliva IgG response might help to improve a first line of defense in the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants.",Anne Sophie Lixenfeld; inga Kuensting; Emily L.

91,Bayesian inference across multiple models suggests a strong increase in lethality of COVID-19 in late 2020 in the UK,"We apply Bayesian inference methods to a suite of distinct compartmental models of generalised SEIR type, in which diagnosis and quarantine are included via extra compartments. We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK, using age-structured, weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a (step-like or graded) change in infection fatality rate (IFR) have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover, they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However, the same models consistently infer that, most probably, the increase in IFR preceded the time window during which new variant B.1.1.7 became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore, according to our models, the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality of a new variant. We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France, which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period, despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant(s) may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020, other factors, such as seasonality, or pressure on health services, are likely to also have contributed.

SummaryO_ST_ABSModel structureC_ST_ABSWe study a family of non-geographic compartmented models structured by age, and by epidemiological and diagnostic state. They include stages within exposed (E) and infected (I) classes, and separation of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals; E and I classes are subdivided according to whether they have had a positive test.

Disease transmission between compartments is modelled by contact matrices derived from survey data and previous Bayesian inference [1]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are incorporated via time- and age-dependent transmission rates. This dependence is parameterised by functions that account for lockdowns, seasonal changes, etc., with parameters inferred from the data except where known a priori (e.g. lockdown dates).

The process of diagnosis is modelled explicitly through the subdivided compartments. The targeting of tests towards symptomatic individuals is controlled by a single inferred parameter. Tested individuals have reduced infectivity, as a model for self-isolation. The fraction of asymptomatic cases is presumed fixed. Most other parameters are inferred (including initial conditions in March 2020). Our models are stochastic at all stages, including the infection and the diagnosis processes.

Similar models are considered for Germany and France. All models are analysed with the same Bayesian methodology as outlined below.

DataWe analyse age-structured, weekly data for cases and mortalities for the UK, France and Germany starting in early March 2020. Our explicit modelling of diagnostic tests allows us to directly use data on the number of daily tests performed and their outcomes to inform parameter estimation. For the UK, the data we used are (i) ONS data for COVID deaths; (ii) PHE data for total numbers of tests; (iii) PHE data for numbers of positive tests. The time series analysed extends from March 2020 until January 2021.

MethodsIn line with the data used, we treat diagnosed cases and mortalities as the only observables; other compartments are treated as unobserved, with occupancies to be inferred from data. Parameters governing overdispersion for infection and death are likewise inferred.

We perform inference using a likelihood function that includes the stochasticity in all model transitions (infection, disease progression, testing, death). The likelihood of the observed data is computed in an approximation that becomes exact for large population sizes, taking into account all statistical dependencies in this limit. Inference is performed at the level of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. Using these MAP estimates we approximate the evidence for each model, allowing us to compare the credibility of different models given the same set of data.

We use the software package PyRoss to build all the models and run the inference procedure [2, 3].

Model specificationsWe compare several distinct models that differ primarily in how interventions and fluctuations are addressed. Some of these variants (Type 1) allow for a time-dependent infection fatality rate (IFR) and some do not (Type 0). Most of our Type 1 models assume a step change in IFR but a ramped (tanh) variation is also studied. In Type 1 models, the values of IFR before and after the change are parameterised in terms of their log-ratio, whose prior is normal distributed with mean zero and standard deviation log(3). The prior for the time of the change is normal with mean 2020-12-12 and standard deviation 2 weeks.

For both Type 0 and Type 1 models we consider several possibilities for the time-dependence of model parameters other than the IFR. For the UK, these are (A) no dependence; (B) changing infectivity; (C) changing overdispersion: (BC) changing infectivity and overdispersion.

FindingsType 1 models for the UK consistently attain a significantly higher model evidence than Type 0 models. (Specifically, they show systematically larger values of the log-posterior.) For each Type 1 model, we separately infer that in the UK, the IFR rose by a factor of about two in late October or early November 2020: the MAP values vary between 1.9-2.2 depending on the model chosen. A similar change is also inferred in Germany and France, but is somewhat less pronounced.

Among the France/Germany models, the ratios of inferred IFRs before/after the step are smaller than in UK but still indicate significant changes, around 1.4 for France and 1.8 for Germany.

The IFR changes in UK are inferred to take place significantly before the B.1.1.7 variant became the dominant UK strain. The significant inferred IFR change in Germany is (to our knowledge) not associated with any new variant.

InterpretationThese findings support the hypothesis [4-6] that the lethality of COVID-19 in the UK increased significantly in late autumn 2020. The MAP estimates further suggest that a larger increase than previously suggested [4, 5], of roughly a factor 2, arose with an onset time in early November. However, the fact that this onset time precedes the rise to dominance of new variant B.1.1.7 suggests that this rise is not solely responsible for the change in IFR. Other factors, such as seasonality and/or pressure on health services, may also be important. If these factors came into play significantly before the arrival of B.1.1.7, then the MAP-estimated onset time of early November could represent a compromise between two successive episodes of increasing IFR within models that, as so far implemented, allow only one.

Note that the IFR depends on the true number of infections (not just diagnosed cases as in the case fatality rate) which, in our model, is itself estimated from the data for cases and testing. Underestimation of this number can lead to an overestimate of the IFR. However, to explain the factor-two increase in fitted IFR this way would require implausible assumptions to be made concerning change in testing efficacy in late autumn 2020 (models TT0, TT1, P0).",Patrick Pietzonka; Erik Brorson; William Bankes; Michael E Cates; Robert L Jack; Ronojoy Adhikari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253311,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253311,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
92,Disulfiram associated with lower risk of Covid-19: a retrospective cohort study,"In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is a substantial need for effective, low-cost therapeutics. We investigated the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in an observational study in a large database of US Veterans Administration clinical records, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). The study is motivated by the unique properties of disulfiram, which has been used as an anti-alcoholism drug since 1948, is non-toxic, easy to manufacture and inexpensive. Disulfiram reduces hyperinflammation in mammalian cells by inhibition of the gasdermin D pore. In a mouse model of sepsis, disulfiram reduced inflammatory cytokines and mortality. Disulfiram also is a low micromolar inhibitor of the Mpro and PLpro viral proteases of SARS-CoV-2.

To investigate the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and severity of COVID-19, we carried out an epidemiological study in the CDW. The VA dataset used has 944,127 patients tested for SARS-Cov-2, 167,327 with a positive test, and 2,233 on disulfiram, of which 188 had a positive SARS-Cov-2 test. A multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorders, and Charlson comorbidity score revealed a reduced incidence of COVID-19 with disulfiram use with a hazard ratio of 0.66 and 95% confidence interval of 0.57 to 0.76 (P < 0.001). There were no deaths among the 188 SARS-Cov-2 positive patients treated with disulfiram. The expected number of deaths would have been 5-6 according to the 3% death rate among the untreated (P-value 0.03).

Our finding of a lower hazard ratio and less severe outcomes for COVID-19 in patients treated with disulfiram compared to those not treated is a statistical association and does not prove any causative effect of disulfiram. However, the results of this study suggest that there is a pharmacological contribution to the reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19 with the use of disulfiram. Given the known anti-inflammatory and viral anti-protease effects of disulfiram, it is reasonable and urgent to initiate accelerated clinical trials to assess whether disulfiram reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity and death.

STRUCTURED OUTLINEO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSIdentifying already approved medications with well characterized antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties supported by real world evidence as candidates for clinical trials for repurposing is an important strategy to manage the pandemic given the ongoing challenges with producing and administering vaccines, the emergence of more infectious viral mutants and the paucity of approved therapies.

We report the negative predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR tests based on a retrospective longitudinal analysis of 5349 qPCR tests collected from 1227 US service members infected with COVID-19 aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) aircraft carrier. In our retrospective evaluation of recovering qPCR-positive quarantined crew members undergoing repeated testing, the negative predictive value is 80% for tests occurring as late as seven weeks following an initial positive qPCR test result.

94,Spread and sources of information and misinformation about COVID-19 early during the pandemic in a U.S. national cohort study,"BackgroundEarly in the pandemic, misinformation about COVID-19 was spread on social media. The purpose of this study was to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information and claims seen and believed about COVID-19 early in the pandemic among U.S. adults. Then, we assessed the impact of believing such claims on engaging in personal protective actions (PPA).

MethodsWe used baseline data from the CHASING COVID Cohort (n = 7,070) collected March 28, 2020 to April 20, 2020 to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information as well as claims circulating on social media that had been seen and believed. We used Poisson regression to determine the association of believing certain claims with engaging in a higher number of PPA.

ResultsThe top three trusted sources of COVID-19 information were the CDC (67.9%), the WHO (53.7%), and State Health Departments (53.0%). Several COVID-19 claims circulated on social media had been seen, e.g., that the virus was created in a laboratory (54.8%). Moreover, substantial proportions of participants indicated agreement with some of these claims. In multivariable regression, we found that belief in certain claims was associated with engaging in a higher number of PPA. For example, believing that paper masks would prevent transmission of the virus was associated with engaging in a higher number of protective actions ({beta} = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.004 - 0.046).

95,The impact of headache disorders on COVID-19 survival: a world population-based analysis,"ImportanceCOVID-19 has not impacted people or countries uniformly. This disparity has prompted investigations to identify clinical and genetic predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Headache, a COVID-19 symptom, has been associated with positive disease prognosis. It is logical to consider whether primary headache disorders, among the most prevalent and disabling diseases globally, may also be associated with reduced viral mortality and thereby may have arisen as adaptive host defences

ObjectiveTo study the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and primary headache disorders.

Main outcome measureUsing a generalized additive model regression (GAM), we analysed data across 171 nations to identify variables which impact COVID-19 mortality rates (demographics, national wealth and government effectiveness, pandemic management indexes, latitude of the countrys capital, prevalence of headache disorders and other diseases). We performed similar analyses of seasonal influenza mortality. Separately, we meta-analysed studies of COVID-19 inpatient survival reporting headache, using PRISMA guidelines.

ResultsIn the global population-level analysis, we observed that a higher prevalence of headache disorders was associated with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate, and represented the main variable contributing to differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between countries (37.8%; F value=10.68). By contrast, we observed a negative trend between the prevalence of headache disorders and influenza death rates. Controversially, when considering headache as a symptom of COVID-19, in the 48 meta-analysed studies we observed a significantly higher risk ratio of survival (RR:2.178 [1.882-2.520], p<0.0001) among COVID-19 inpatients with headache.

Conclusions and RelevanceHeadache as a primary disorder is more prevalent in nations with higher COVID-19 mortality, whereas headache as a COVID-19 symptom is associated with enhanced survival.

Identifying host-specific genetic factors indicate biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprising 49,562 COVID-19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries worldwide. We reported 15 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. We further identified smoking and body mass index as causal risk factors for severe COVID-19.

To investigate possible drivers of this phenomenon, we use regression to characterize the relationship of many environmental, geographical, meteorological, mobility, and socioeconomic factors with the lockdown-attributable changes in PM2.5.

98,Impact of close interpersonal contact on COVID-19 incidence: evidence from one year of mobile device data,"Close contact between people is the primary route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to quantify interpersonal contact at the population-level by using anonymized mobile device geolocation data. We computed the frequency of contact (within six feet) between people in Connecticut during February 2020 - January 2021. Then we aggregated counts of contact events by area of residence to obtain an estimate of the total intensity of interpersonal contact experienced by residents of each town for each day. When incorporated into a susceptible-exposed-infective-removed (SEIR) model of COVID-19 transmission, the contact rate accurately predicted COVID-19 cases in Connecticut towns during the timespan. The pattern of contact rate in Connecticut explains the large initial wave of infections during March-April, the subsequent drop in cases during June-August, local outbreaks during August-September, broad statewide resurgence during September-December, and decline in January 2021. Contact rate data can help guide public health messaging campaigns to encourage social distancing and in the allocation of testing resources to detect or prevent emerging local outbreaks more quickly than traditional case investigation.

99,"High household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States: living density, viral load, and disproportionate impact on communities of color","BackgroundFew prospective studies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households have been reported from the United States, where COVID-19 cases are the highest in the world and the pandemic has had disproportionate impact on communities of color.

Methods and FindingsThis is a prospective observational study. Between April-October 2020, the UNC CO-HOST study enrolled 102 COVID-positive persons and 213 of their household members across the Piedmont region of North Carolina, including 45% who identified as Hispanic/Latinx or non-white. Households were enrolled a median of 6 days from onset of symptoms in the index case. Secondary cases within the household were detected either by PCR of a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab on study day 1 and weekly nasal swabs (days 7, 14, 21) thereafter, or based on seroconversion by day 28. After excluding household contacts exposed at the same time as the index case, the secondary attack rate (SAR) among susceptible household contacts was 60% (106/176, 95% CI 53%-67%). The majority of secondary cases were already infected at study enrollment (73/106), while 33 were observed during study follow-up. Despite the potential for continuous exposure and sequential transmission over time, 93% (84/90, 95% CI 86%-97%) of PCR-positive secondary cases were detected within 14 days of symptom onset in the index case, while 83% were detected within 10 days. Index cases with high NP viral load (>10^6 viral copies/ul) at enrollment were more likely to transmit virus to household contacts during the study (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3-18 p=0.02). Furthermore, NP viral load was correlated within families (ICC=0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.60), meaning persons in the same household were more likely to have similar viral loads, suggesting an inoculum effect. High household living density was associated with a higher risk of secondary household transmission (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.3-55) for households with >3 persons occupying <6 rooms (SAR=91%, 95% CI 71-98%). Index cases who self-identified as Hispanic/Latinx or non-white were more likely to experience a high living density and transmit virus to a household member, translating into an SAR in minority households of 70%, versus 52% in white households (p=0.05).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 transmits early and often among household members. Risk for spread and subsequent disease is elevated in high-inoculum households with limited living space. Very high infection rates due to household crowding likely contribute to the increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and morbidity observed among racial and ethnic minorities in the US. Quarantine for 14 days from symptom onset of the first case in the household is appropriate to prevent onward transmission from the household. Ultimately, primary prevention through equitable distribution of effective vaccines is of paramount importance.

AUTHORS SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSO_LIUnderstanding the secondary attack rate and the timing of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households is important to determine the role of household transmission in the larger pandemic and to guide public health policies about quarantine.
C_LIO_LIProspective studies looking at the determinants of household transmission are sparse, particularly studies including substantial racial and ethnic minorities in the United States and studies with adequate follow-up to detect sequential transmission events.
C_LIO_LIIdentifying individuals at high risk of transmitting and acquiring SARS-CoV-2 will inform strategies for reducing transmission in the household, or reducing disease in those exposed.
C_LI

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIBetween April-November 2020, the UNC CO-HOST study enrolled 102 households across the Piedmont region of North Carolina, including 45% with an index case who identified as racial or ethnic minorities.
C_LIO_LIOverall secondary attack rate was 60% with two-thirds of cases already infected at study enrollment.
C_LIO_LIDespite the potential for sequential transmission in the household, the majority of secondary cases were detected within 10 days of symptom onset of the index case.
C_LIO_LIViral loads were correlated within families, suggesting an inoculum effect.
C_LIO_LIHigh viral load in the index case was associated with a greater likelihood of household transmission.
C_LIO_LISpouses/partners of the COVID-positive index case and household members with obesity were at higher risk of becoming infected.
C_LIO_LIHigh household living density contributed to an increased risk of household transmission.
C_LIO_LIRacial/ethnic minorities had an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in their households in comparison to members of the majority (white) racial group.
C_LI

What do these findings mean?O_LIHousehold transmission often occurs quickly after a household member is infected.
C_LIO_LIHigh viral load increases the risk of transmission.
C_LIO_LIHigh viral load cases cluster within households - suggesting high viral inoculum in the index case may put the whole household at risk for more severe disease.
C_LIO_LIIncreased household density may promote transmission within racial and ethnic minority households.
C_LIO_LIEarly at-home point-of-care testing, and ultimately vaccination, is necessary to effectively decrease household transmission.

100,A Dynamical Map to Describe Covid-19 Epidemics,"This paper proposes a dynamical map to describe COVID-19 epidemics based on the classical susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. The novel map represents Covid-19 discrete-time dynamics standing for the infected, cumulative infected and vaccinated populations. The simplicity of the discrete description allows the analytical calculation of useful information to evaluate the epidemic stage and to support decision making. In this regard, it should be pointed out the estimation of the number death cases and the herd immunization point. Numerical simulations show the model capacity to describe Covid-19 dynamics properly representing real data and describing different scenario patterns. Real data of Germany, Italy and Brazil are of concern to verify the model ability to describe Covid-19 dynamics. The model showed to be useful to describe the epidemic evolution and the effect of vaccination, being able to predict different pandemic scenarios.",Eduardo Villela M. dos Reis; Marcelo A.

101,"Evaluation of Measles Surveillance System amidst Covid 19 pandemic in Asutifi North District, Ahafo Region, Ghana.","BackgroundMeasles is a disease of public health importance earmarked for elimination by all WHO Regions. Globally, more than 140 000 people died from Measles in 2018 affecting mostly children under 5 years, despite the availability of safe and effective vaccine.

MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted. Disease surveillance focal persons were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire on the system operations and use of Measles case definitions. Measles case-based investigation forms from 2015 - 2020 were reviewed for its timeliness and data quality. CDC updated guidelines for surveillance system evaluation was used to assess its usefulness and attributes. Data was analyzed for frequencies and proportions and results presented in tables and graphs.

ResultsMeasles surveillance system was timely as 100% (69/69) of the suspected cases were reported on time. Also, the level of representativeness was good as all the 14 health facilities in the District were participating in the Measles Surveillance system. Majority 73.1 (44/60) of the case-based investigation forms filled were incomplete with some columns wrongly filled.

102,"Type I, II, and III interferon signatures correspond to COVID-19 disease severity","We analyzed the plasma levels of interferons and cytokines, and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity. Mild patients exhibited transient type I interferon responses, while ICU patients had prolonged type I interferon responses with hyper-inflammation mediated by interferon regulatory factor 1. Type II interferon responses were compromised in ICU patients. Type III interferon responses were induced in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in convalescent patients.

103,Specific allelic discrimination of N501Y and other SARS-CoV-2 mutations by ddPCR detects B.1.1.7 lineage in Washington State,"Real-time epidemiological tracking of variants of interest can help limit the spread of more contagious forms of SARS-CoV-2, such as those containing the N501Y mutation. Typically, genetic sequencing is required to be able to track variants of interest in real-time. However, sequencing can take time and may not be accessible in all laboratories. Genotyping by RT-ddPCR offers an alternative to sequencing to rapidly detect variants of concern through discrimination of specific mutations such as N501Y that is associated with increased transmissibility. Here we describe the first cases of the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Washington State by using a combination of RT-PCR, RT-ddPCR, and next-generation sequencing. We screened 1,035 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by our CDC-based laboratory developed assay using ThermoFishers multiplex RT-PCR COVID-19 assay over four weeks from late December 2020 to early January 2021. S gene dropout candidates were subsequently assayed by RT-ddPCR to confirm four mutations within the S gene associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage: a deletion at amino acid (AA) 69-70 (ACATGT), deletion at AA 145, (TTA), N501Y mutation (TAT), and S982A mutation (GCA). All four targets were detected in two specimens, and follow-up sequencing revealed a total of 10 mutations in the S gene and phylogenetic clustering within the B.1.1.7 lineage. As variants of concern become increasingly prevalent, molecular diagnostic tools like RT-ddPCR can be utilized to quickly, accurately, and sensitively distinguish more contagious lineages of SARS-CoV-2.",Garrett A.

104,SARS-CoV-2 Serology Status Detected by Commercialized Platforms Distinguishes Previous Infection and Vaccination Adaptive Immune Responses,"BackgroundThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 110 million individuals and led to 2.5 million deaths worldwide. As more individuals are vaccinated, the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms needs to be evaluated.

MethodsThe ability of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms to detect previous infection or vaccination were evaluated using a cohort of 53 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, 89 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated healthcare workers (Pfizer or Moderna), and 127 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Serology results were compared to a cell based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) neutralizing antibodies assay.

ResultsThe Roche S-(spike) antibody and Diazyme neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) assays detected adaptive immune response in 100.0% and 90.1% of vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of vaccine (initial and booster), respectively. The Roche N-(nucleocapsid) antibody assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect adaptive immune response in vaccinated individuals. The Diazyme Nabs assay correlated with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 neutralization titers (R2= 0.70), while correlation of the Roche S-antibody assay was weaker (R2= 0.39). Median PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 titers more than doubled in vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of the Moderna vaccine (ID50: 597) compared to individuals that received a single dose (ID50: 284).

ConclusionsThe Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays robustly detected adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The Diazyme NAbs assay strongly correlates with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in vaccinated individuals. Understanding the reactivity of commercially available serology platforms is important when distinguishing vaccination response versus natural infection.

SummaryThe Roche S (spike protein)-antibody and Diazyme neutralizing-antibodies (NAbs) assays were evaluated for their clinical utility in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 related adaptive immune responses by testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed patients, SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated individuals, and SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. Commercial serology results were compared to results generated using a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) NAbs assay and previously validated SARS-CoV-2 commercial serology assays (Roche N (nucleocapsid protein) antibody and Diazyme IgG). We demonstrate that the Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays detected adaptive immune response in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 PSV NAbs. The Roche S-antibody assay had an observed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100% for individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. By contrast, the Roche N assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect vaccine adaptive immune responses. Our findings also indicate that the Diazyme NAbs assay correlates strongly with the levels of SARS-CoV-2 ID50 neutralization titers using the PSV Nab assay in vaccinated individuals.",Raymond T Suhandynata; Nicholas J Bevins; Jenny T Tran; Deli Huang; Melissa A Hoffman; Kyle Lund; Michael J Kelner; Ronald W McLawhon; Steven L Gonias; David Nemazee; Robert L Fitzgerald,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253299,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253299,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
105,A tale of three SARS-CoV-2 variants with independently acquired P681H mutations in New York State,"Several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have independently acquired some of the same Spike protein mutations - notably E484K, N501Y, S477N, and K417T - associated with increased viral transmission and/or reduced sensitivity to neutralization by antibodies. Repeated evolution of the same mutations, particularly in variants that are now rapidly spreading in various regions of the world, suggests a fitness advantage. Mutations at position P681 in Spike - possibly affecting viral transmission - have also evolved multiple times, including in two variants of concern. Here, we describe three variants circulating in New York State that have independently acquired a P681H mutation and the different trajectories they have taken. While one variant rose to high prevalence since later summer 2020 it appears to be in decline. The other two variants were more recently detected in New York and harbor additional Spike mutations that might be cause for continued monitoring. The latter two P681H variants have shown moderate increases in prevalence but ultimately all might be subject to the same fate as more competitive variants come to dominate the scene.",Erica Lasek-Nesselquist; Janice Pata; Erasmus Schneider; Kirsten St. George,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253285,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253285,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

Meanwhile, the intention to get the vaccine or vaccine intake were decreased by perceptions of the negative side-effects and the general impediments to vaccination.",Marta Malesza; Erich Wittmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253346,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253346,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
107,"Risk, clinical course and outcome of ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a multicenter cohort study","Background and purposeThe frequency of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 varies in the current literature, and risk factors are unknown. We assessed the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

MethodsWe included patients with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in 16 hospitals participating in the international CAPACITY-COVID registry between March 1st and August 1st, 2020. Patients were screened for the occurrence of acute ischemic stroke. We calculated the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke and compared risk factors, cardiovascular complications, and in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ischemic stroke.

ResultsWe included 2147 patients with COVID-19, of whom 586 (27.3%) needed treatment at an intensive care unit (ICU). Thirty-eight patients (1.8%) had an ischemic stroke. Patients with stroke were older, but did not differ in sex or cardiovascular risk factors. Median time between onset of COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of stroke was two weeks. The incidence of ischemic stroke was higher among patients who were treated at an ICU (16/586; 2.7% versus 22/1561; 1.4%; p=0.039). Pulmonary embolism was more common in patients with (8/38; 21.1%) than in those without stroke (160/2109; 7.6%; adjusted RR: 2.08; 95%CI:1.52-2.84). Twenty-seven patients with ischemic stroke (71.1%) died during admission or were functional dependent at discharge and in-hospital mortality. Patients with ischemic stroke were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted RR 1.56; 95%CI:1.13-2.15) than patients without stroke.

ConclusionsIn this multicenter cohort study, the cumulative incidence of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was approximately 2%, with a higher risk in patients treated at an ICU. The majority of stroke patients had a poor outcome.

108,Are vaccines safe in patients with Long COVID? A prospective observational study.,"IntroductionAlthough the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 is well established, there are no published studies on the impact on symptoms in patients with Long Covid. Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals.

MethodsPatients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression.

ResultsForty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache).

When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.

ConclusionsReceipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing.

109,Reducing the Cost of Rapid Antigen Tests through Swab Pooling and Extraction in a Device,"The COVID-19 pandemic places a significant stress on the viral testing capabilities of many countries. The value of rapid point-of-care (PoC) antigen tests is becoming increasingly clear, but implementing frequent large scale testing is costly. We have developed an inexpensive device for pooling swabs, extracting specimens, and detecting viral antigens with a commercial lateral flow assay detecting the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen. The holder of the device can be produced locally through 3D printing. The extraction and the elution can be performed with the entire set-up encapsulated in a transparent bag, minimizing the risk of infection for the operator. With 6 swabs holding approx. 0.1 mL specimen each and 0.35 mL extraction buffer, 43{+/-}6 % (n= 8) of the signal for an individual extraction of a positive control standard was obtained. Image analysis still showed a signal-to-noise ratio of [&ge;] 7 upon further eight-fold dilution. Our current total cost of materials is below $ 2 per tested person or 20% of our cost for an individual PoC test. These findings suggest that pooling can make frequent testing more affordable for schools, universities and other institutions, without decreasing sensitivity to an unacceptable level. Further validation of the method is required.",Tim Berking; Sabrina G Lorenz; Alexander Ulrich; Joachim Greiner; Clemens Richert,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21252969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21252969,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
110,Analysis of Accumulated SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion in North Carolina: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 Community Research Partnership is a population-based longitudinal syndromic and sero-surveillance study. The study includes over 17,000 participants from six healthcare systems in North Carolina who submitted over 49,000 serology results. The purpose of this study is to use these serology data to estimate the cumulative proportion of the North Carolina population that has either been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or developed a measurable humoral response to vaccination.

MethodsAdult community residents were invited to participate in the study between April 2020 and February 2021. Demographic information was collected and daily symptom screen was completed using a secure, HIPPA-compliant, online portal. A portion of participants were mailed kits containing a lateral flow assay to be used in-home to test for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. The cumulative proportion of participants who tested positive at least once during the study was calculated. A standard Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to illustrate the probability of seroconversion over time up to December 20, 2020 (before vaccines available). A separate analysis was performed to describe the influence of vaccines during an extended period through February 15, 2021.

Results17,688 participants contributed at least one serology result. Approximately two-thirds of the population were female and almost three-quarters were between 30 and 64 years of age. The average number of serology test results submitted per participant was 3.0 ({+/-}1.9). At December 20, 2020, the overall probability of seropositivity in the CCRP population was 32.6%. At February 15, 2021 the probability among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers was 83% and 49%, respectively. An inflection upward in the probability of seropositivity was demonstrated around the end of December, suggesting an influence of vaccinations, especially for healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers, those in the oldest age category (60+ years) were 38% less likely to have seroconverted by February 15, 2021.

ConclusionsResults of this study suggest more North Carolina residents may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the number of documented cases as determined by positive RNA or antigen tests. The influence of vaccinations on seropositivity among North Carolina residents is also demonstrated. Additional research is needed to fully characterize the impact of seropositivity on immunity and the ultimate course of the pandemic.",John C Williamson; Thomas F Wierzba; Michele Santacatterina; Iqra Munawar; Austin L Seals; Christine Ann Pittman Ballard; Martha Alexander-Miller; Michael S Runyon; Lewis H McCurdy; Michael A Gibbs; Amina Ahmed; William H Lagarde; Patrick D Maguire; Robin King-Thiele; Terri Hamrick; Abdalla Ihmeidan; Shakira Henderson; Diane Uschner; David M Herrington; John W Sanders,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253226,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253226,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
111,Optimal vaccination strategies for COVID-19 based on dynamical social networks with real-time updating,"Vaccination strategy is crucial in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the supply is limited, contact network-based interventions can be most powerful to set an optimal strategy by identifying high-risk individuals or communities. However, due to the high dimension, only partial and noisy network information can be available in practice, especially for dynamical systems where the contact networks are highly time-variant. Furthermore, numerous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 impact considerably the current infectious probability, requiring real-time network updating algorithms. In this study, we propose a sequential network updating approach based on data assimilation techniques to combine different sources of temporal information. We then prioritise the individuals with high-degree or high-centrality, obtained from the assimilated networks, for vaccination. The assimilation-based approach is compared with the standard method (based on partially observed networks) and a random selection strategy in terms of vaccination effectiveness in a SIR model. The numerical comparison is first carried out using real-world face-to-face dynamical networks collected in a high school, following by sequential multi-layer networks, generated relying on the Barabasi-Albert model emulating the department of Computing at Imperial College London in the UK as an example.",Sibo Cheng; Rossella Arcucci; Christopher Pain; Yike Guo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253356,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253356,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
112,Efficient maternofetal transplacental transfer of anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies after antenatal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy and early infancy can result in severe disease. Evaluating the serologic response after maternal vaccination during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer has important implications for maternal care and vaccination strategies.

ObjectiveTo assess maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after antenatal mRNA vaccination.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study took place at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel in February 2021. Maternal and cord blood sera were collected for antibody measurement from mother/newborn dyads following antenatal vaccination.

ExposureSARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination.

Main outcome and measuresSpike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) - specific, IgG levels were evaluated in maternal and cord blood sera.

ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 20 parturients, with a median maternal age of 32 y ears and a median gestational age of 393/7 weeks at the time of delivery. The median time lapsed from the first and second doses of vaccine administration until delivery was 33 [IQR 30-37] and 11 [IQR 9-15] days, respectively. Of the 20 dyads, all women an d infants were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG levels in maternal sera were positively correlated to their respective concentrations in cord blood ({rho}s= 0.72; P<0.001 and {rho}s= 0.72; P <0.001, respectively). Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG titers in cord blood were directly correlated with time lapsed since the administration of the first vaccine dose ({rho}s= 0.71; P =0.001 and {rho}s= 0.63; P=0.004, respectively).

113,Evolution of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 over seven months: experience of the Nationwide Seroprevalence ENE-COVID Study in Spain,"ObjectivesTo analyse temporal trends in SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG throughout the four rounds of the nationwide seroepidemiologic study ENE-COVID (April-November 2020), and to compare the fourth-round results of two immunoassays detecting antibodies against nucleocapsid and to S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD).

MethodsA chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) was offered to all participants in the first three rounds (Abbott; anti-nucleocapsid IgG). In the fourth round we offered this test and a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) (Beckman; anti-RBD IgG) to i) a randomly selected sub-cohort, ii) participants who were IgG-positive in any of the three first rounds; and iii) participants who were IgG-positive in the fourth round by point-of-care immunochromatography.

ResultsImmunoassays involving 10,153 participants (82.2% of people invited to donate samples) were performed in the fourth round. A total of 2595 participants (35.1% of participants with immunoassay results in the four rounds) were positive for anti-nucleocapsid IgG in at least one round. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG became undetectable in 43.3% of participants with positive first-round results. Pneumonia was more frequent in participants with anti-nucleocapsid IgG in all four rounds (11.2%) than those in which IgG became undetectable (2.4%).

114,Characterizing the COVID-19 illness experience to inform the study of post-acute sequalae and recovery: a qualitative study,"We aimed to characterize the variability in the illness experience and recovery process from COVID-19. We conducted in-depth individual interviews with participants enrolled in the Long-term Immunological Impact of Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort study in San Francisco, California from June through October of 2020. Participants were adults who had a previously confirmed positive SARV-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result, had recovered or were recovering from acute infection, and underwent serial evaluations at our clinical research center. We purposefully sampled 24 English- and Spanish-speaking adults with asymptomatic, mild and severe symptomatic infection, including those who were hospitalized, and those with HIV co-infection. Half of our sample (50.0%) identified as Latinx/Hispanic and most of the participants were men (62.5%). We used thematic analysis to characterize the illness experience, recovery process, and mental health impact of experiencing COVID-19 and present clinical data for each participant. Emergent themes were: (1) across symptom profiles and severity, experiencing COVID-19 was associated with psychological distress, (2) among participants with symptomatic infection, the illness experience was characterized by uncertainty in terms of managing symptoms and recovery, and (3) despite wide-ranging illness experiences, participants shared many common characteristics, including health information-seeking behavior facilitated by access to medical care, and uncertainty regarding the course of their illness and recovery.

115,Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients in outbreak on a cruise ship,"BackgroundA few studies on antibody testing have focused on asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with low initial anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-testing performance was evaluated using blood samples from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples were collected from 143 COVID-19 patients during an outbreak on a cruise ship 3 weeks after diagnosis. Simultaneously, a second SARS-CoV-2 genetic test was performed. Samples stored before the COVID-19 pandemic were also used to evaluate the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare false-negative-with positive-result samples.

ResultsSensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive values of LFA-detected IgM antibodies were 0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.613, respectively; those of LFA-detected IgG antibodies were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972, and 0.601, respectively; and those of ECLIA-detected total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.848, respectively. IgM-, IgG-, and total-antibody positivity rates in the patients with negative results from the second genetic testing were 22.9%, 47.6%, and 72.4%, respectively. All antibody titers, especially those of the IgG antibody against nucleocapsid protein, were significantly lower in blood samples with false-negative results than in those with positive results.

In this study we identified 690,000 patients infected with COVID-19 with commercial health insurance coverage across the country between April 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020. From prior health care claims, we determined each persons pre-existing diseases among 26 common chronic diseases. Across age-sex strata we determined the relationships between these conditions and severe COVID-19 infections: ICU admission and extended in-patient stay. We classify disease according to risk, develop multivariable models to predict infection outcomes, and created an online risk assessment tool to estimate risk of ICU admission based on pre-existing health conditions.

It is contrasted to the corresponding historic all-cause mortality per year depending on age and sex observed in these countries. Although there are substantial differences in the age and sex dependency of COVID-19 mortality between countries, there are some common features: Exponential increase with age is a good model to describe and analyse both COVID-19 and all-cause mortality above an age of 40 years, where almost all COVID-19 death occur. Age dependency is stronger for COVID-19 mortality than for all-cause mortality, males have an excess risk compared to women which flattens off with increasing age. Also with regard to calendar time, there were differences in the age and sex dependency between countries with the common tendency that male excess risk of COVID-19 mortality was smaller in the second half of the year.",Peter Bauer; Jonas Brugger; Franz Koenig; Martin Posch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253420,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253420,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
119,"Clinical presentation, disease course and outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with and without pre-existing cardiac disease: a cohort study across sixteen countries","AimsPatients with cardiac disease are considered high risk for poor outcomes following hospitalization with COVID-19. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate heterogeneity in associations between various heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality.

Method and resultsWe used data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry and LEOSS study. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between different types of pre-existent heart disease and in-hospital mortality. 10,481 patients with COVID-19 were included (22.4% aged 66 - 75 years; 38.7% female) of which 30.5% had a history of cardiac disease. Patients with heart disease were older, predominantly male and more likely to have other comorbid conditions when compared to those without. COVID-19 symptoms at presentation did not differ between these groups. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease (30.3%; n=968 versus 15.7%; n=1143). However, following multivariable adjustment this difference was not significant (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.06 [95% CI 0.98 - 1.15, p-value 0.13]). Associations with in-hospital mortality by heart disease subtypes differed considerably, with the strongest association for NYHA III/IV heart failure (aRR 1.43 [95% CI 1.22 - 1.68, p-value <0.001]) and atrial fibrillation (aRR 1.14 [95% CI 1.04 - 1.24, p-value 0.01]). None of the other heart disease subtypes, including ischemic heart disease, remained significant after multivariable adjustment.

ConclusionThere is considerable heterogeneity in the strength of association between heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality.

Study DesignA survey study of summer day camp directors in the metro-New York area was conducted in September, 2020. The survey inquired about camper demographics, COVID-10 related policies, and the number of COVID-19 cases and exposures at each camp.

ResultsResponses were received from 77% (23/30) of camp directors at the completion of the 2020 summer. There were 8,480 camper children and 3,698 staff across the 23 camps surveyed. A variety of precautions were taken to limit COVID-19 incidence among campers and staff, most often including COVID-19 screening at entry, cohorting campers, maximizing outdoor activities, mandating mask use when indoors, and frequent hand sanitizing. Six staff and one camper tested positive for COVID-19. There was no secondary spread within the staff or campers in any of the camps.

ConclusionCamps successfully stayed open in the summer of 2020. The low level of COVID-19 in the community was critical to the initial success of camp opening.

121,Oxygen provision to severely ill COVID-19 patients at the peak of the 2020 pandemic in a Swedish district hospital: medical records-based cohort study,"Oxygen therapy is a low-cost and life-saving therapy for patients with COVID-19. Yet, it is a limited resource in many hospitals in low income countries and in the 2020 pandemic even hospitals in richer countries reported oxygen shortages. An accurate understanding of oxygen requirements is needed for capacity planning. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the average flow-rate of oxygen to severe COVID-19-patients to be 10 l/min. However, there is a lack of empirical hospital-based data about the oxygen provision to patients. This study aimed to estimate the oxygen provision to COVID-19 patients with severe disease in a Swedish district hospital.

A retrospective, medical records-based cohort study was conducted in March to May 2020 in a Swedish district hospital. All adult patients with severe COVID-19 - those who received oxygen in the ward and had no ICU-admission during their hospital stay - were included. Data were collected on the oxygen flow-rates provided to the patients throughout their stay in hospital, and summary measures of oxygen provision calculated.

One-hundred and twenty six patients were included. Their median age was 70 years and 43% were female. On admission, 27% had a peripheral oxygen saturation of [&le;]91% and 54% had a respiratory rate of [&ge;]25/min. The mean oxygen flow-rate to patients while receiving oxygen therapy was 3.0 l/min (SD 2.9) and the mean total volume of oxygen provided per patient admission was 16,000 l (SD 23,000).

In conclusion, the provision of oxygen to severely ill COVID-19-patients was lower than previously estimated. Further research is required before global estimates are adjusted.

122,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cincinnati Ohio USA from August to December 2020,"The world is currently in a pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) caused by a novel positive-sense, single-stranded RNA {beta}-coronavirus referred to as SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately, most infected individuals recover and are then resistant to re-infection for a period, indicating that a vaccination approach can be successful. Elucidation of rates of past SARS-CoV-2 infection within select regions across the United States of America (USA) will help direct vaccination efforts and together will inform our approach towards achieving herd immunity. Here we investigated rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, USA metropolitan area from August to December 2020, just prior to initiation of the national vaccination program. Examination of 9,550 adult blood donor volunteers for serum IgG antibody positivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein showed an overall prevalence of 8.40%, measured as 7.56% in the first 58 days of this time frame, versus a significant increase to 9.24% in the last 58 days, and a final rate of 12.86% in December 2020. Approximately 56% of Spike seropositive individuals also had immunoreactivity against the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the Spike protein, which is associated with viral neutralization. Males and females in the Cincinnati area showed nearly identical rates of past infection, and rates among Hispanics, African Americans and Caucasians were not significantly different. Interestingly, donors under 30 years of age had the highest rates of past infection, while those over 60 had the lowest. Geographic analysis showed that the West side of Cincinnati had a rate of 9.63% versus 8.13% on the East side (demarcated by Interstate-75), while the adjoining area of Kentucky was 7.04% (as demarcated by the Ohio River).

123,Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 and Mitigation Using Box Fan Air Cleaners in a Poorly Ventilated Classroom,"Many indoor places, including aged classrooms and offices, prisons, homeless shelters, etc., are poorly ventilated but resource-limited to afford expensive ventilation upgrade or commercial air purification systems, raising concerns on the safety of opening activities in these places in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation. Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space. The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient. However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards. In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone. The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain its efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient associated with human thermal plume and hot ventilation air during cold seasons. Overall, our study shows that box fan air cleaners can serve as an effective low-cost alternative for mitigating airborne transmission risks in poorly ventilated spaces.",Ruichen He; Wanjiao Liu; John Elson; Rainer Vogt; Clay Maranville; Jiarong Hong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253395,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253395,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

In this study, we sought to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among health care workers in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected data from 234 health care workers through a self-administered online survey from 16 January to 15 February 2021. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses using binary logistic regression were performed using STATA version 15. The results showed that 39.3% of health care workers had the intention of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors such as sex, category of health care workers, relative being diagnosed with COVID-19, and trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government in the fight against COVID-19 proved to be significant predictors of the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns about the safety of vaccines and the adverse side effects of the vaccine were identified as the main reasons why health care workers would decline uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. The self-reported low intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana requires the urgent call of the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders to critically address health care workers concerns about the safety and adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as this would increase vaccine uptake.

125,COVID-19 and Medical Education in Ghana: Assessing the Impact,"Medical education in Ghana has been affected in many ways by the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the pandemic has affected both preclinical and clinical segments of medical education, the effect has been felt more at the clinical stage. Medical students on vacation who started their clinical training abroad could not return to their destination of study to complete their programme because of COVID-19 linked travel restrictions. This qualitative study examined how COVID-19 impacted on teaching and learning at a public higher education institution offering clinical medical education in Ghana for over 200 medical students. These medical students were from three different higher education institutions with varied curriculum outcomes. Thus, for them to be considered as a single group required innovativeness on the part of administrators. Open-ended interviews were held with administrators and the outcome indicated that salient aspects of the clinical training process had been impacted. These included administration of clinical education, curriculum, student learning, student assessment and code of practice. As a result of the pandemic, student learning shifted from traditional face to face interaction to online learning at the beginning. Some of the administrative challenges that ensued included the need for reduced number of students per tutor and introduction of afternoon sessions with a limited budget. The paper concludes that COVID-19 has been disruptive to traditional medical education in Ghana. However, the novel learning processes may provide opportunities to increase access to medical education using a phased system of learning. The findings from this study should have implications for policy and contribute to the discourse on blended learning in medical education in Ghana while ensuring that quality is maintained in all instances.",Edward Asumanu; Linda Tsevi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253306,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253306,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
126,Automated Production of Research Data Marts from a Canonical Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Data Repository: Applications to COVID-19 Research,"ObjectiveObjective: The COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the need for timely real-world data (RWD) for research. To meet this need, several large clinical consortia have developed networks for access to RWD from electronic health records (EHR), each with its own common data model (CDM) and custom pipeline for extraction, transformation, and load operations for production and incremental updating. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely RWD (e.g., 2-week delay) make this less feasible.

Methods and MaterialsWe describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical model for representation of clinical data for automated transformation to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs and the near automated production of linked clinical data repositories (CDRs) for COVID-19 research using the FHIR subscription standard. The approach was applied to healthcare data from a large academic institution and was evaluated using published quality assessment tools.

ResultsSix years of data (1.07M patients, 10.1M encounters, 137M laboratory results), were loaded into the FHIR CDR producing 3 linked real-time linked repositories: FHIR, PCORnet, and OMOP. PCORnet and OMOP databases were refined in subsequent post processing steps into production releases and met published quality standards. The approach greatly reduced CDM production efforts.

ConclusionsFHIR and FHIR CDRs can play an important role in enhancing the availability of RWD from EHR systems.

127,A rapid review of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization in the U.S.: alignment between Federal guidance and State practice,"BackgroundPopulation groups to be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. have been determined at the Federal level. Evidence suggests that there is variation in how States have implemented this guidance. This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice.

MethodsAn online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group.

ResultsHealthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Of the 37 States including frontline essential workers, 12 assigned them to a lower priority than recommended. Almost all States included the 65-74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by many States.

ConclusionsAcross the U.S, the prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable. Essential workers were the most often excluded or less highly prioritised group compared to Federal guidance. Some socially vulnerable groups were highly prioritized in State plans, whilst others were mentioned in only a few States.

128,Immunodominant B cell epitope in SARS-CoV-2 RBD comprises a B.1.351 and P.1 mutation hotspot: implications for viral spread and antibody escape,"Recent SARS-CoV-2 variants pose important concerns due to their higher transmissibility (1) and escape (2) from previous infections or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (nAb). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein is a major nAb target (3), but data on its B cell epitopes are still lacking. Using a peptide microarray, we identified an immunodominant epitope (S415-429) recognized by 68% of sera from 71 convalescent Brazilians infected with the ancestral variant. In contrast with previous studies, we have identified a linear IgG and IgA antibody binding epitope within the RBD. IgG and IgA antibody levels for this epitope positively correlated with nAb titers, suggesting a potential target of antibody neutralizing activity. Interestingly, this immunodominant RBD region harbors the mutation hotspot site K417 present in P.1 (K417T) and B.1.351 (K417N) variants. In silico simulation analyses indicate impaired RBD binding to nAb in both variants and that a glycosylation in the B.1.351 417N could further hinder antibody binding as compared to the K417T mutation in P.1. This is in line with published data showing that nAb from either convalescents or anti-CoV-2 vaccinees are less effective towards B.1.351 than for P.1.

Using a direct RT-PCR method with the Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene), the clinical sensitivity of the gargle was 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2 to 98.3%) and was similar to the sensitivity of the ONPS (93.8%; 95% CI, 88.2 to 97.3%), despite significantly lower viral RNA concentration in gargles, as reflected by higher cycle threshold values. No single specimen type detected all COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable in gargles at room temperature for at least 7 days. The simplicity of this sampling method coupled with the accessibility of spring water are clear advantages in a pandemic situation where testing frequency, turnaround time and shortage of consumables and trained staff are critical elements.",Jeannot Dumaresq; François Coutlée; P.

130,Using translational in vitro-in vivo modeling to improve drug repurposing outcomes for inhaled COVID-19 therapeutics,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for antiviral treatments that can be deployed rapidly. Drug repurposing represents a promising means of achieving this objective, but repurposing efforts are often unsuccessful. A common hurdle to effective drug repurposing is a failure to achieve a sufficient therapeutic window in the new indication. A clear example is the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, where the approved dose (administered orally) fails to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lungs. Our proposed solution to the problem of ineffective drug repurposing for COVID-19 antivirals is two-fold: to broaden the therapeutic window by reformulating therapeutics for the pulmonary route, and to select drug repurposing candidates based on their model-predicted therapeutic index for inhalation. In this article, we propose a two-stage model-driven screening and validation process for selecting inhaled antiviral drug repurposing candidates. While we have applied this approach in the specific context of COVID-19, this in vitro-in vivo translational methodology is also broadly applicable to repurposing drugs for diseases of the lower respiratory tract.",Madison Stoddard; Lin Yuan; Arijit Chakravarty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253375,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253375,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
131,SARS-CoV-2 specific immune-signature in direct contacts of COVID-19 cases protect them from contracting disease: A Retrospective Study,"The response to SARS-CoV-2 is largely impacted by the level of exposure and the status of immunity. The nature of protection shown by direct contacts of COVID-19 positive patients is quite intriguing to note. We aimed to study the immune differences reinforcing contact individuals in circumventing the disease. Our observation showed direct contacts of PCR positive patients developed elevated neutralizing antibody titres and cytokine levels. On the other hand, single cell data revealed differential usage of V(D)J genes and unique BCR clonotypes imparting protective immune signatures.

132,An observational cohort study on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and B.1.1.7 variant infection in healthcare workers by antibody and vaccination status,"BackgroundNatural and vaccine-induced immunity will play a key role in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 variants have the potential to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity.

MethodsIn a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing.

Results13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7.

ConclusionNatural infection resulting in detectable anti-spike antibodies and two vaccine doses both provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including against the B.1.1.7 variant.

133,Recovered not restored: Long-term health consequences after mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients,"BackgroundWhile the leading symptoms during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are acute and the majority of patients fully recover, a significant fraction of patients now increasingly experience long-term health consequences. However, most data available focus on health-related events after severe infection and hospitalization. We present a longitudinal, prospective analysis of health consequences in patients who initially presented with no or minor symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hence we focus on mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients.

MethodsWe included 958 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in this study. Patients were observed for seven months from April 6th to December 2nd 2020 for long-term symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We identified anosmia, ageusia, fatigue or shortness of breath as most common, persisting symptoms at month 4 and 7 and summarized presence of such long-term health consequences as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Predictors of long-term symptoms were assessed using an uni- and multivariable logistic regression model.

FindingsWe observed 442 and 353 patients over four and seven months after symptom onset, respectively. Four months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8.6% (38/442) of patients presented with shortness of breath, 12.4% (55/442) with anosmia, 11.1% (49/442) with ageusia and 9.7% (43/442) with fatigue. At least one of these characteristic symptoms was present in 27.8% (123/442) and 34.8% (123/353) at month 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. This corresponds to 12.8% patients with long-lasting symptoms relative to the initial total cohort (123/958). A lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk to develop long-term symptoms.

InterpretationThe on-going presence of either shortness of breath, anosmia, ageusia or fatigue as long-lasting symptoms even in non-hospitalized patients was observed at four and seven months post-infection and summarized as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). The continued assessment of patients with PCS will become a major task to define and mitigate the socioeconomic and medical long-term effects of COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSData about long-term health consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 is scarce and most available data describe health consequences in hospitalized patients during acute COVID-19. However, these studies do not take into account the vast majority of patients with a milder course of infection (WHO score1-3).

Added value of this studyOur cohort consists of mostly mild COVID-19 cases that have been prospectively followed for a median time of 6.8 months. At least one trained physician critically reviewed the patients reported symptoms at each visit. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG at each visit to correlate reported symptoms with serological data. At 4 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, shortness of breath occurred in 8.6% (38/442), anosmia in 12.4% (55/442), ageusia in 11.1% (49/442), and fatigue in 9.7% (43/442) of patients. At least one characteristic symptom was present in 27.8% (123/442) and 34.8% (123/353) at months 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively. Symptoms were summarized as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Relative to our initial total cohort (123/958), this corresponds to 12.8% patients with long-lasting symptoms. Lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk of developing long-term symptoms.

Implications of all available evidenceWe believe that our findings have important implications for the fields of infectious diseases and public health, because we show long-term health consequences may occur even after very mild COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. As up to 81% of all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients present with mild disease, it can be expected that PCS will affect a larger number of individuals than initially assumed, posing major medical, social and economic challenges.",Max Augustin; Philipp Schommers; Melanie Stecher; Felix Dewald; Lutz Gieselmann; Henning Gruell; Carola Horn; Kanika Vanshylla; Veronica Di Cristianziano; Luise Osebold; Maria Roventa; Toqeer Riaz; Nikolai Tschernoster; Janine Altmueller; Leonard Rose; Susanne Salomon; Vanessa Priesner; Jan Christoffer Luers; Christian Albus; Stephan Rosenkranz; Birgit Gathof; Gerd Faetkenheuer; Michael Hallek; Florian Klein; Isabelle Suarez; Clara Lehmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253207,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253207,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
134,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection in Saliva by real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF Methods,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the need for rapid implementation of diagnostic assays for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens. While multiple molecular methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, supply chain constraints and need for easier and safer specimen collection warrant alternative specimen types, particularly saliva. Although saliva has been found to be a comparable clinical matrix for detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of diagnostic and analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we compared two methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva: the Roche cobas(R) 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test and the Agena Biosciences MassARRAY(R) SARS-CoV-2 Panel/MassARRAY(R) System. Overall, both systems had high agreement with one another, and both demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of each platform and determined the limit of detection of the Roche assay was four times lower than that of Agena for saliva specimens (390.6 v. 1,562.5 copies/mL). Furthermore, across individual target components of each assay, T2 and N2 targets had the lowest limits of detection for each platform, respectively. Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection in two technologies that have high agreement and differ in analytical sensitivities overall and across individual component targets. The addition of saliva as an acceptable specimen and understanding the sensitivity for testing on these platforms can further inform public health measures for screening and detection to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",Matthew M.

We compared percentage of correct chest compression position, percentage of full chest recoil, percentage of correct compression depth, average compression depth, percentage of correct compression rate and average compression rate between both methods. In a second approach, potential aerosol spread during chest compression was visualized.

ResultsThere was no significant difference between manual and leg-heel compression. The distance to potential aerosol spread could have been increased by leg-heel method.

136,"Comparing COVID-19 risk factors in Brazil using machine learning: the importance of socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on Brazil. Brazils social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities and persisting political disarray. This complex scenario motivates careful study of the clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors contributing to increased risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil specifically.

MethodsWe consider the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe catalog, a very rich respiratory infection dataset which allows us to estimate the importance of several non-laboratorial and socio-geographic factors on COVID-19 mortality. We analyze the catalog using machine learning algorithms to account for likely complex interdependence between metrics.

FindingsThe XGBoost algorithm achieved excellent performance, producing an AUC-ROC of 0.813 (95%CI 0.810-0.817), and outperforming logistic regression. Using our model we found that, in Brazil, socioeconomic, geographical and structural factors are more important than individual comorbidities. Particularly important factors were: The state of residence and its development index; the distance to the hospital (especially for rural and less developed areas); the level of education; hospital funding model and strain. Ethnicity is also confirmed to be more important than comorbidities but less than the aforementioned factors.

InterpretationSocioeconomic and structural factors are as important as biological factors in determining the outcome of COVID-19. This has important consequences for policy making, especially on vaccination/non-pharmacological preventative measures, hospital management and healthcare network organization.

137,Mean Vitamin D levels in 19 European Countries & COVID-19 Mortality over 10 months,"ObjectivesReports early in the epidemic linking low mean national Vitamin D level with increased COVID-19 death, and until recently little research on the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on severity of COVID-19, led to this update of the initial report studying mortality up to the end of January 2021.

Methods, Design and SettingCoronavirus pandemic data for 19 European countries were downloaded from Our World in Data, which was last updated on January 24, 2021. Data from March 21, 2020 to January 22, 2021 were included in the statistical analysis. Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean data were collected by literature review. Poisson mixed-effect model was used to model the data.

ResultsEuropean countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID-19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean greater than 50, relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068 - 4.347, p-value = 0.032). A statistically significant negative moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean and the number of COVID-19 deaths for each 14-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic time period.

ConclusionsThe observation of the significantly lower COVID-19 mortality rates in countries with lowest annual sun exposure but highest mean Vitamin-D (25)-HD levels provides support for more awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy due to emergence of large number of COVID-19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these observations.

Strengths of this studyLarge number of different European populations studied with different policies of food fortification and different population Vitamin D levels

ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to construct contact patterns to evaluate the degree to which social contacts rebounded to normal levels, as well as direct public health efforts toward age- and location-specific settings.

DesignFour population-based cross-sectional surveys.

SettingCanada.

ParticipantsMembers of a paid panel representative of Canadian adults by age, gender, official language, and region of residence.

MethodsRespondents provided information about the age and setting for each direct contact made in a 24-hour period. Contact matrices were constructed and contacts for those under the age of 18 years imputed. The next generation matrix approach was used to estimate the reproduction number (Rt) for each survey. Respondents with children estimated the number of contacts their children made in school and extracurricular settings.

ResultsEstimated Rt values were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.69) for May, 0.48 (95% CI: 0.29-0.68) for July, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.63-1.52) for September, and 0.81 (0.47-1.17) for December. The highest proportion of reported contacts occurred within the home (51.3% in May), in  other locations (49.2% in July) and at work (66.3% and 65.4% in September and December). Respondents with children reported an average of 22.7 (95% CI: 21.1-24.3) (September) and 19.0 (95% CI 17.7-20.4) (December) contacts at school per day per child in attendance.

139,Comprehensive evaluation of the impact of sociodemographic inequalities on adverse outcomes and excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City has been sharp, as several social inequalities coexist with chronic comorbidities. Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of social, municipal, and individual factors on the COVID-19 pandemic in working-age population living in Mexico City. To this end, we used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System; furthermore, we used a multidimensional metric, the social lag index (DISLI), to evaluate its interaction with mean urban population density (MUPD) and its impact on COVID-19 rates. Influence DISLI and MUPD on the effect of vehicular mobility policies on COVID-19 rates were also tested. Finally, we assessed the influence of MUPD and DISLI on discrepancies of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality compared with death certificates from the General Civil Registry. We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically active sectors and who experienced increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The impact of social inequalities transcends individuals and has significant effects at a municipality level, with and interaction between DISLI and MUPD. Marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced an accentuated risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts across marginalized municipalities. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths and significant excess mortality associated with non-COVID-19 deaths closely related to MUPD/DISLI in an ambulatory setting, which could be a negative externality of hospital reconversion.

140,Dynamic versus Continuous Interventions: Optimizing Lockdown Policies for COVID-19,"In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while millions of people await the administration of a vaccine, social distancing remains the leading approach towards the effect commonly known as ""flattening the curve"" of infections. Over the last year, governmental administrations throughout the globe have implemented various lockdown policies in hopes of slowing down the transmission of the disease. However, the current lack of consensus on when and how these policies should be implemented reflects the need for further studies regarding these questions. In this paper, we tackle the issue of lockdown policy management, in particular in terms of lockdown placement (how often, when, and how long these periods should be), in order to minimize the peak of infections in a specific population. We introduce a novel combination of classic mathematical disease modelling using the equation-based SEIR model, and Evolutionary Strategies (ES) for optimizing the peak of infections. The method is evaluated using data collected in different countries, and a particular focus is placed on the study of the effect of specific model parameters on lockdown optimization, such as the transmission rate ({beta}), of which 4 alternative modelling functions have been proposed and analyzed. Our results indicate that this transmission rate parameter significantly influences the resulting optimal strategies. In particular, the presence of a gradual decay of the rate of transmission during lockdown leads to longer, more sparsely placed confinement periods while an abrupt, instantaneous drop in the amount of contacts per person favors shorter but more frequent lockdowns. Although these results are limited by the scope of action provided by the simplicity of the SEIR model, they suggest that the influence of the evolution of the rate of transmission along the disease should be assessed in further studies with alternative optimization strategies (agent-based) and models (SEIRSHUD).",Kaan Akinci; Javier Fdez; Elena Pena-Tapia; Olaf Witkowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253324,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253324,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
141,Analysis of severe outcomes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England using ICNARC Case Mix Programme and QResearch databases.,"BackgroundA new, more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in the UK. We estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in critical ill patients, and overall mortality associated with VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant. We also compare clinical outcomes between these variants   groups.

MethodsWe linked a large primary care (QResearch), the national critical care (ICNARC CMP) and the COVID-19 testing (PHE) database and extracted two cohorts. The first was used to explore the association between VOC B.1.1.7 and critical care admission and 28-day mortality. The second to determine the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with VOC B.1.1.7 compared to those without. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, region, other socio-demographics and comorbidities (asthma, COPD, type I and II, hypertension). We reported information on types and duration of organ supports for the two variants   groups.

FindingsThe first cohort included 198,420 patients. Of these, 80,494 had VOC B.1.1.7, 712 were critically ill and 630 died by 28 days. The second cohort included 3432 critically ill patients. Of these, 2019 had VOC B.1.1.7 and 822 died at the end of critical care. Using the first cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios for critical care admission and mortality to be 1.99 (95% CI: 1.59, 2.49) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.25-2.03) for VOC B.1.1.7 compared with the original variant group, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in critical care, estimated using the second cohort, was 0.93 (95% CI 0.76-1.15) for patients with VOC B.1.1.7, compared to those without.

InterpretationVOC B.1.1.7 appears to be more severe. Patients with VOC B.1.1.7 are at increased risk of critical care admission and mortality compared with patients without. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appears independent of virus strain.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01, or lineage B.1.1.7, was detected in England in September 2020. The characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with VOC B.1.1.7 are not yet known. VOC B.1.1.7 has been associated with increased transmissibility. Early analyses have suggested infection with VOC B.1.1.7 may be associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with infection with other virus variants, but these analyses had either limited ability to adjust for key confounding variables or did not consider critical care admission. The effects of VOC B.1.1.7 on severe COVID-19 outcomes remain unclear.

Added value of this studyThis study found a 60% higher risk of 28-day mortality associated with infection with VOC B.1.1.7 in patients tested in the community in comparison with the original variant, when adjusted for key confounding variables. The risk of critical care admission for those with VOC B.1.1.7 is double the risk associated with the original variant. For patients receiving critical care, the infecting variant is not associated with the risk of mortality at the end of critical care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe higher mortality and rate of critical care admission associated with VOC B.1.1.7, combined with its known increased transmissibility, are likely to put health care systems under further stress.

142,The role of connectivity on COVID-19 preventive approaches,"Preventive and modelling approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic have been primarily based on the age or occupation, and often disregard the importance of the population contact structure and individual connectivity. To address this gap, we developed models that first incorporate the role of heterogeneity and connectivity and then can be expanded to make assumptions about demographic characteristics. Results demonstrate that variations in the number of connections of individuals within a population modify the impact of public health interventions such vaccination approaches.

143,"Effect of natural mutations of SARS-CoV-2 on spike structure, conformation and antigenicity","New SARS-CoV-2 variants that have accumulated multiple mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein enable increased transmission and resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Here, we study the antigenic and structural impacts of the S protein mutations from four variants, one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and three that rapidly spread in human populations and originated in the United Kingdom, Brazil or South Africa. All variants either retained or improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Brazil) spike variants showed reduced binding to neutralizing NTD and RBD antibodies, respectively, while the B.1.351 (SA) variant showed reduced binding to both NTD- and RBD-directed antibodies.

144,"Prediction of severe COVID-19 cases requiring a ventilator in Tokyo, Japan","BackgroundTo avoid exhaustion of medical resources by COVID-19, policy-makers must predict care needs, specifically the proportion of severe cases likely to need ventilator care.

ObjectiveThis study was designed to use a statistical model to elucidate dynamics of severe cases in Tokyo and to discuss the timing of effective policy activation.

MethodsThe study extended from April 27 through October 18, 2020 in Japans Tokyo Metropolitan area. Medical exhaustion was defined as use of more than half of the ventilator capacity available before the COVID-19 outbreak. We regressed the number of severe cases on the newly onset patients of more than 14 days prior. As earlier research indicated, the COVID-19 severity changed at the end of May. Therefore, we added dummy variables to reflect changing severity from June and its product with newly onset patients as the explanatory variable. Then we calculated the threshold using R(t): R(t)=0.99 for the number of patients 14 days prior was used as a threshold at which strong countermeasures should be activated to keep to avoid medical exhaustion.

ResultsThe critical number signaling medical exhaustion in Tokyo was defined as 655 cases. We selected 15, 30, 60 and 90 days prior as explanatory variables for explaining the number of severe cases. A coefficient of determination larger than 0.95 was inferred as indicating good fit. The threshold was estimated as more than 4500 cases for R(t)=1.1 and monotonically decreasing by R(t) to be 600 cases for R(t)=2.5.

Discussion and ConclusionResults showed that newly onset patients reported more than 14 days prior can explain the number of severe cases very well. We also confirmed the threshold number of patients 14 days prior by R(t) for which strong countermeasures should be activated to avoid medical exhaustion with R(t)=0.99.

145,Google Trends as a method to predict new COVID-19 cases,"In this paper, we develop a method that can detect and predict the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 at an early stage. With this method, we try to lay the empirical basis for the development of the model of digital monitoring and prediction of the occurrence of new cases of COVID-19 in Croatia, relying on the analytical tool Google Trends (GT).

ResultsIn Croatia search activities using GT for terms such as   PCR +Covid"", ""PCR + test"", and symptoms ""cough + corona"", ""pneumonia + corona""; ""muscle pain + corona"" correlate strongly with officially reported cases of the disease. Google Trends tools are suitable for predicting the emergence of new COVID-19 cases in Croatia, and that the data collected by this method correlate with official data.

The benefit of this method is reliable estimates that can enable public health officials to prepare and better respond to the possible return of a pandemic in certain parts of the country. If a region experiences an early, sharp increase in Covid-19-like-illness Google searches, it may be possible to focus additional resources on that region to identify the etiology of the outbreak, providing extra medical capacity or raising local media awareness as necessary.

Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with Covid-19 symptoms, this method can serve as an early alarm to predict the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 in the specific area in Croatia.",Tado Juric,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253452,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253452,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
146,Negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR or rapid antigen test result and the subsequent risk of being infectious: a mathematical simulation study,"BackgroundA considerable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Therefore, different polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or rapid antigen test (RAT)-based approaches are being discussed and applied to identify infectious cases that would have gone undetected (e.g., in nursing homes). In this article, we provide a framework to estimate the time-dependent risk of being infectious after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test and we simulate the number of expected cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested negative.

MethodsA Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate infections that occurred over a one-week period in populations with 1,000 individuals following a negative SARS-Cov-2 test. Parameters representing the application of PCR tests or RATs are utilized, and SARS-CoV-2 7-day incidences between 25 and 200 per 100,000 people are considered. Simulation results are compared to case numbers predicted via a mathematical equation.

ResultsThe simulations showed a linear increase in cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. The different false negative rates of PCR tests and RATs have a strong impact on the number of simulated cases. The simulated and the mathematically predicted case numbers were comparable. However, Monte Carlo simulations highlight that, due to random effects, infectious cases can exceed predicted case numbers even shortly after a test was conducted.

ConclusionsThe analysis demonstrates that the number of infectious cases in a population can be effectively reduced by the screening of asymptomatic individuals. However, the time since the negative test and the underlying SARS-CoV-2 incidence are critical parameters in determining the observed subsequent number of cases in tested populations.",Ralf Krumkamp; Benno Kreuels; Veronika K Jaeger; Juergen May; Rafael Mikolajczyk; Andre Karch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253440,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253440,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True
147,A simplified SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay,"COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the highly infectious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is engaging worldwide scientific research to find a timely and effective eradication strategy. Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemy, it is necessary to quantify the neutralizing antibodies induction by vaccination, since they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, have been minimized in term of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays.

148,Qualification of the UniBw protection concept in different rooms of the Obermenzinger high school,"Current research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne particles. These particles are generated when infected persons exhale and they spread throughout the room, resulting in a high concentration and thus a high risk of infection of non-infected persons. One way to reduce the concentration of particles is to filter them using mobile room air cleaners, which can be easily set up and reduce the concentration of viruses or keep them at a low level. Since many studies are conducted in generic rooms, the question of the cleaning performance of such room air cleaners in real rooms arises. In order to investigate this, measurements of the effectiveness were carried out in a total of 4 different rooms of the ""Obermenzinger Gymnasium"" (Obermenzinger high school) in Munich. It can be shown that good effects of the room air cleaners are achieved even under realistic conditions.

149,Prevalence of COVID-19 in Iran: Results of the first survey of the Iranian COVID-19 Serological Surveillance program,"Abstract Background: This study aims to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population of Iran. Methods: The target population was all Iranian people aged six years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28,314 subjects from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias, and sampling design. Results: Of the 28,314 Iranians selected, 11,256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male, and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until August 20, 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 13.3%, 15.2%), which was equal to 11,958,346 (95% confidence interval: 11,211,011-12,746,776) individuals. The prevalence of infection was 14.6%, 13.8%, 16.6%, 11.7%, and 19.4% among men, women, urban population, rural population, and individuals 60 years of age and older, respectively. Ardabil, Golestan, and Khuzestan provinces had the highest prevalence, and Alborz, Hormozgan, and Kerman provinces had the lowest. Conclusions: Based on the study results, a large proportion of the Iranian population had not yet been infected by COVID-19. The observance of hygienic principles and social restrictions should therefore continue until the majority of the population has been vaccinated.

150,Sars-CoV-2 attack rate in reception and accommodation centres for asylum seekers: systematic review of outbreak media reports in Germany,"ObjectivesDespite concerns about the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (Sars-CoV-2) in refugee camps, data on attack rates and effectiveness of containment measures are lacking. We aimed to (1) quantify the attack rate of Sars-CoV-2 during outbreaks in reception and accommodation centres in Germany, (2) assess differences in the attack rate based on containment measures, and (3) provide an overview of testing strategies, communication, conflicts, and protection measures for refugees with special needs.

MethodsSystematic web-based review of outbreak media reports (until June 2020) on confirmed Sars-CoV-2 cases in reception centers for asylum seekers in Germany using the google search engine. Reports were screened for pre-defined inclusion criteria and complemented by snowball searches. Data on facility name, location, confirmed cases, containment measures, communication, protection strategies, and conflicts was extracted for each outbreak and reporting date. Evidence synthesis: meta-analysis and negative binomial regression.

FindingsWe identified 337 media reports on 101 Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks in 99 reception and accommodation centers in Germany. The pooled Sars-CoV-2 attack rate was 13.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 9.8-16.7). Outbreak sites implementing mass quarantine (n=76) showed higher rates (15.7; 95% CI: 11.6 - 20.2) compared to sites using conventional strategies (6.6; 95%CI: 3.1 - 11.2), yielding a rate ratio of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.27-0.72) adjusted for testing strategies, type and size of accommodation. Conflicts occurred in at least 11.8% of all outbreaks. Few sites reported specific measures to protect refugees with special needs.

ConclusionMass quarantine is associated with higher attack rates, and appears to be a counter-productive containment measure in overcrowded camps. Although further research with individual-level data is required to rule out residual confounding, reception centers and refugee camps should follow the available guidelines on Covid-19 response and refrain from mass quarantine if physical distancing cannot be guaranteed.",Rosa Jahn; Maren Hintermeier; Kayvan Bozorgmehr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21249641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21249641,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among undergraduate medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February - 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, hurried testing of vaccines prior to launch and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Risk perception regarding contracting COVID-19 vaccine reduced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitation in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers.

152,"Modelling, prediction and design of national COVID-19 lockdowns by stringency and duration","The implementation of lockdowns has been a key policy to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to keep under control the number of infections. However, quantitatively predicting in advance the effects of lockdowns based on their stringency and duration is a complex task, in turn making it difficult for governments to design effective strategies to stop the disease. Leveraging a novel mathematical ""hybrid"" approach, we propose a new epidemic model that is able to predict the future number of active cases and deaths when lockdowns with different stringency levels or durations are enforced. The key observation is that lockdown-induced modifications of social habits may not be captured by traditional mean-field compartmental models because these models assume uniformity of social interactions among the population, which fails during lockdown. Our model is able to capture the abrupt social habit changes caused by lockdowns. The results are validated on the data of Israel and Germany by predicting past lockdowns and providing predictions in alternative lockdown scenarios (different stringency and duration). The findings show that our model can effectively support the design of lockdown strategies by stringency and duration, and quantitatively forecast the course of the epidemic during lockdown.",Alberto Mellone; Zilong Gong; Giordano Scarciotti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253454,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

DesignRetrospective cohort study including three propensity-matched groups.

SettingThis study merged three data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient lab testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database.

ParticipantsIndividuals 18 to 65 years old with continuous health plan enrollment from January 2019 to date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Three comparator groups were identified and propensity-score matched to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, a historical 2019 comparator group and a historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness (vLRTI).

Main outcome measuresOver 50 clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase (index date + 21 days) were ascertained using ICD-10 codes. Excess risk due to SARS-CoV-2 during the 4 months following the acute phase of illness and hazard ratios with 95% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals were calculated.

ResultsThis study found 14% of adults [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had at least one new clinical sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. When considering risk for specific sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection during the post-acute phase, clinical outcomes including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue were significantly elevated compared to the three propensity-matched comparator groups (2020, 2019, vLRTI). Significant risk differences due to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 when compared to the 2020 comparator group.

ConclusionsOur results confirm excess risk for developing clinical sequelae due to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen among other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults ([&le;]50 years), adults who did not have pre-existing conditions or adults who were not hospitalized due to COVID-19 were still at elevated risk for developing new clinical sequelae. The elevated risk for incident sequelae during the post-acute phase is relevant for healthcare planning.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSmall observational studies and case reports of hospitalized patients have shown some COVID-19 survivors suffer from short- and long-term sequelae. Few studies have characterized the excess risk of clinical sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase among adults [&le;]65 years of age in a large generalizable sample.

What this study addsThis study found 14% of individuals [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had a diagnosis of at least one new sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. Elevated risk for specific clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase of illness was noted across a range of organ systems including cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, respiratory, and mental health complications. The risk for incident sequelae increases with age, pre-existing conditions, and hospitalization for COVID-19; however, even among adults [&le;] 50 years of age and individuals without pre-existing conditions or hospitalization due to COVID-19, risk for some clinical sequelae is still elevated.

154,Impact of Vaccine Prioritization Strategies on Mitigating COVID-19: An Agent-Based Simulation Study using an Urban Region in the United States,"BackgroundApproval of novel vaccines for COVID-19 has brought hope and expectations, but not without additional challenges. One central challenge is how to appropriately prioritize the use of limited supply of vaccines. This study evaluates various prioritization strategies and the efficacy of the vaccination campaign underway in the U.S.

MethodsThe study develops a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under various social interventions including full and partial closures, isolation and quarantine, use of face mask and contact tracing, and vaccination. The model is populated with demographic and societal data for an urban community in the U.S. with 2.8 million residents as well as viral parameters. The model tracks daily numbers of infected, hospitalized, and deaths for all census age-groups. Model is calibrated using parameters for viral transmission and level of community circulation of individuals. Published data from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard is used to validate the model. Vaccination strategies are compared using hypothesis test for pairwise comparisons.

ResultsThree prioritization strategies examined are: a close variant of the CDC recommendation, an age-stratified strategy, and a random strategy. The impact of vaccination is also contrasted with a no vaccination scenario. The comparison shows that the ongoing campaign in the U.S. using vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is expected to 1) reduce the cumulative number of infection by 10% and 2) help the pandemic to subside below a small threshold of 100 daily new reported cases sooner by approximately a month. The prioritization strategies when compared with each other showed no significant difference in their impacts on pandemic mitigation.

ConclusionsRecent explosive growth of the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to shrink the susceptible population. This, we believe, will likely limit the expected number of people that could be prevented from getting infected due to vaccination. A shrinking susceptible pool may also be an attributable reason for the observed lack of statistical difference among the outcomes of the prioritization strategies. However, the invariance of the strategies should give more latitude for decision makers in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.",Hanisha Anand Tatapudi; Rachita Das; Tapas K Das,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253447,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,True

Using structure-guided chimeric spike designs and multiplexed immunizations, we demonstrate protection against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and bat CoV (BtCoV) RsSHC014 challenge in highly vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike mRNAs containing N-terminal domain (NTD), and receptor binding domains (RBD) induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against three high-risk sarbecoviruses: SARS-CoV, RsSHC014, and WIV-1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a 10 to >500-fold reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous sarbecovirus strains, but SARS-CoV challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infection including measurable lung pathology. Importantly, chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized both the D614G and the South African B.1.351 variants of concern despite some reduction in neutralization activity.

158,An Innovative antibody-based Plug-and-Play strategy for SARS-CoV-2,"The novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) remains a public health threat worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 enters human host lung cells via its spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a process critical dependent on host protease-mediated fusion event. Thus, effective targeted therapies blocking the first step of viral fusion and cellular entry remains a critical unmet medical need to overcome disease pathology. Here we engineered and describe an antibody-based novel and targeted plug-and-play strategy, which directly competes with the proteolytic activation function of SAR-CoV-2 spike protein. The described strategy involves the engineering of furin substrate residues in IgG1 Fc-extended flexible region of spike targeting antibody. Our results with spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeting CR3022 antibody support blockade of the viral function using proof of concept ACE2 overexpressing cells. Our study reveals analytical, safe, and selective mechanistic insights for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic design and is broadly applicable to the future coronaviridae family members (including mutant variants) exploiting the host protease system for cellular entry.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434589,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434589,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,False
159,A metal ion orients mRNA to ensure accurate 2'-O ribosyl methylation of the first nucleotide of the SARS-CoV-2 genome,"The SARS-CoV-2 nsp16/nsp10 enzyme complex modifies the 2-OH of the first transcribed nucleotide of the viral mRNA by covalently attaching a methyl group to it. The 2-O methylation of the first nucleotide converts the status of mRNA cap from Cap-0 to Cap-1, and thus, helps the virus evade immune surveillance in the host cell. Here, we report two structures of nsp16/nsp10 representing pre- and post-release states of the RNA product (Cap-1). We observe overall widening of the enzyme upon product formation, and an inward twisting motion in the substrate binding region upon product release. These conformational changes reset the enzyme for the next round of catalysis. The structures also identify a unique binding mode and the importance of a divalent metal ion for 2-O methylation. We also describe underlying structural basis for the perturbed enzymatic activity of a clinical variant of SARS-CoV-2, and a previous SARS-CoV outbreak strain.",Thiruselvam Viswanathan; Anurag Misra; Siu-Hong Chan; Shan Qi; Nan Dai; Shailee Arya; Luis Martinez-Sobrido; Yogesh K.

160,Spike vs nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection: application in nasopharyngeal swab specimens,"Public health experts emphasize the need for quick, point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection as an effective strategy for controlling virus spread. To this end, many ""antigen"" detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2s nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprised of four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spikes S1 subunit. The assays performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike-assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct<25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct<25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being out-performed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results.

161,A tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein-based COVID-19 vaccine ZF2001 protects mice and nonhuman primates,"A safe, efficacious and deployable vaccine is urgently needed to control COVID-19 pandemic. We report here the preclinical development of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ZF2001, which contains tandem-repeat dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein with alum-based adjuvant. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). ZF2001 induced high levels of RBD-binding and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in both mice and NHPs, and also elicited balanced TH1/TH2 cellular responses in NHPs. Two doses of ZF2001 protected Ad-hACE2-transduced mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as detected by reduced viral RNA and relieved lung injuries. In NHPs, vaccination of either 25 g or 50 g ZF2001 prevented infection with SARS-CoV-2 in lung, trachea and bronchi, with milder lung lesions. No evidence of disease enhancement is observed in both models. ZF2001 is being evaluated in the ongoing international multi-center Phase 3 trials (NCT04646590) and has been approved for emergency use in Uzbekistan.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434928,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434928,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
162,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are detectable in saliva,"Vaccines are critical for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within [~]1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5). Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied. Here, we report that antibodies to the S-protein and its RBD are present in saliva samples from mRNA-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). Within 1-2 weeks after their second dose, 37/37 and 8/8 recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, had S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, while IgA was detected in a substantial proportion. These observations may be relevant to vaccine-mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.",Thomas J.

163,SARS-CoV-2 comprehensive receptor profiling: mechanistic insight to drive new therapeutic strategies,"Here we describe a hypothesis free approach to screen for interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with human cell surface receptors. We used a library screening approach to detect binding interactions across one of the largest known panels of membrane-bound and soluble receptors, comprising 5845 targets, expressed recombinantly in human cells. We were able confirm and replicate SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 and other putative coreceptors such as CD209 and CLEC4M. More significantly, we identified interactions with a number of novel SARS-CoV-2 S binding proteins. Three of these novel receptors, NID1, CNTN1 and APOA4 were specific to SARS-CoV-2, and not SARS-COV, with APOA4 binding the S-protein with equal affinity as ACE2. With this knowledge we may further understand the disease pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients and how infection by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to differences in pathology in specific organs or indeed the virulence observed in different ethnicities. Importantly we illustrate a methodology which can be used for rapid, unbiassed identification of cell surface receptors, to support drug screening and drug repurposing approaches for this and future pandemics.",Sarah MV Brockbank; Raquel Faba-Rodriguez; Lyn Rosenbrier Ribeiro; Catherine Geh; Helen Thomas; Jenni Delight; Lucy Coverley; W Mark Abbott; Jo Soden; Jim Freeth,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434937,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434937,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
164,Novel inhibition mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 main protease by ebselen and its derivatives,"The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has triggered numerous efforts to develop therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), which is a critical enzyme for transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2, is a key target for therapeutic development against COVID-19. An organoselenium drug called ebselen has recently been demonstrated to have strong inhibition against Mpro and antiviral activity but its molecular mode of action is unknown preventing further development. We have examined the binding modes of ebselen and its derivative in Mpro via high resolution co-crystallography and investigated their chemical reactivity via mass spectrometry. Stronger Mpro inhibition than ebselen and potent ability to rescue infected cells were observed for a number of ebselen derivatives. A free selenium atom bound with cysteine 145 of Mpro catalytic dyad has been revealed by crystallographic studies of Mpro with ebselen and MR6-31-2 suggesting hydrolysis of the enzyme bound organoselenium covalent adduct, formation of a phenolic by-product is confirmed by mass spectrometry.

165,Determining the risk of developing symptomatic covid-19 infection after attending hospital for radiological examinations: controlled cohort study,"OBJECTIVETo determine whether brief attendance for outpatient radiological investigations is associated with increased risk of clinically significant coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection.

DESIGNObservational cohort study with a historical control.

SETTING2 large UK University Hospitals located in Nottingham and Cardiff.

PARTICIPANTSAll 47,340 patients who attended an outpatient radiology appointment at Nottingham University Hospitals and University Hospital of Wales during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, and 70,655 patients that comprised the control cohort who attended for outpatient radiology the same period in 2019.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe risk of developing clinically significant covid-19 infection within 28-days of attending a radiological examination. Covid-19 infection rates for the 2020 cohort were compared against a control group who attended in 2019.

RESULTS84 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were temporally associated with 47,340 radiological examinations across two hospitals in 2020. This low infection rate was higher than the 2019 control cohort; OR 2.507 (1.766 - 3.559) and equates to an approximate 1 positive covid-19 infection per 1000 radiology investigations.

CONCLUSIONSOur data suggests that attending hospitals for outpatient radiological investigations during the pandemic is associated with a very small absolute risk of acquiring clinically significant covid-19 infection. It is unlikely that this risk is directly attributable to radiology attendance, considering the reasons leading individuals to attend hospitals during the pandemic, the true attributable risk will likely be even lower.

167,Tiled-ClickSeq for targeted sequencing of complete coronavirus genomes with simultaneous capture of RNA recombination and minority variants,"High-throughput genomics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to characterize virus evolution and to identify adaptations that affect pathogenicity or transmission. While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called  Tiled-ClickSeq. Tiled-ClickSeq uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, obviating the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction using Illumina adaptors generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5UTR, at high depth and specificity to virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.",Andrew Laurence Routh; Elizabeth Jaworski; Rose M Langsjoen; Barbara Judy; Patrick Newman; Yiyang Zhou; Daniele Swetnam; Aaron L Miller; Jessica A Plante; Kenneth S Plante; Jianli Dong; Ping Ren; Thomas Ksiazek; Vineet D Menachery; Scott Weaver,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434828,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434828,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
168,Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies causal links between blood proteins and severe COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic death toll now surpasses two million individuals and there is a need for early identification of individuals at increased risk of mortality. Host genetic variation partially drives the immune and biochemical responses to COVID-19 that lead to risk of mortality. We identify and prioritise blood proteins and biomarkers that may indicate increased risk for severe COVID-19, via a proteome Mendelian randomization approach by collecting genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for >4,000 blood proteins. After multiple testing correction, troponin I3, cardiac type (TNNI3) had the strongest effect (odds ratio (O.R.) of 6.86 per standard deviation increase in protein level), with proteinase 3 (PRTN3) (O.R.=2.48), major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 2 (HLA-DQA2) (O.R.=2.29), the C4A-C4B heterodimer (O.R.=1.76) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1 (LRPAP1) (O.R.=1.73) also being associated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. Conversely, major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MHC1A) (O.R.=0.6) and natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3 (NCR3) (O.R.=0.46) were associated with lower odds. These proteins are involved in heart muscle contraction, natural killer and antigen presenting cells, and the major histocompatibility complex.

169,Functional Antibodies in COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma,"In the absence of an effective vaccine or monoclonal therapeutic, transfer of convalescent plasma (CCP) was proposed early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as an easily accessible therapy. However, despite the global excitement around this historically valuable therapeutic approach, results from CCP trials have been mixed and highly debated. Unlike other therapeutic interventions, CCP represents a heterogeneous drug. Each CCP unit is unique and collected from an individual recovered COVID-19 patient, making the interpretation of therapeutic benefit more complicated. While the prevailing view in the field would suggest that it is administration of neutralizing antibodies via CCP that centrally provides therapeutic benefit to newly infected COVID-19 patients, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients already possess neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of antibodies can extend far beyond their simple ability to bind and block infection, especially related to their ability to interact with the innate immune system. In our work we deeply profiled the SARS-CoV-2-specific Fc-response in CCP donors, along with the recipients prior to and after CCP transfer, revealing striking SARS-CoV-2 specific Fc-heterogeneity across CCP units and their recipients. However, CCP units possessed more functional antibodies than acute COVID-19 patients, that shaped the evolution of COVID-19 patient humoral profiles via distinct immunomodulatory effects that varied by pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG titers in the patients. Our analysis identified surprising influence of both S and Nucleocapsid (N) specific antibody functions not only in direct antiviral activity but also in anti-inflammatory effects. These findings offer insights for more comprehensive interpretation of correlates of immunity in ongoing large scale CCP trials and for the design of next generation therapeutic design.",Jonathan D Herman; Chuangqi Wang; Carolin Loos; Hyun ah Yoon; Johanna Rivera; M.

170,Point-of-care ultrasonography for risk stratification of non-critical suspected COVID-19 patients on admission (POCUSCO): a prospective binational study,"BackgroundLung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is highly effective in detecting pulmonary peripheral patterns and may allow early identification of patients who are likely to develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that L-POCUS performed during the initial examination would identify non-severe COVID-19 patients with a high risk of getting worse.

MethodsPOCUSCO was a prospective, multicenter study. Non-critical adult patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included and had L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following admission. The severity of lung damage was assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. The primary outcome was the rate of patients requiring intubation or who died within 14 days following inclusion.

ResultsAmong 296 participating patients, 8 (2.7%) had primary outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic of L-POCUS was 0.80 [95%CI:0.60-0.94]. The score values which achieved a sensibility > 95% in defining low-risk patients and a specificity > 95% in defining high-risk patients were <1 and [&ge;]16, respectively. The rate of patients with an unfavorable outcome was 0/95 (0%[95%CI:0-3.9]) for low-risk patients (score=0) versus 4/184 (2.17%[95%CI:0.8-5.5]) for intermediate-risk patients (score 1-15) and 4/17 (23.5%[95%CI:11.4-42.4]) for high-risk patients (score [&ge;]16). In patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n=58), the AUC of L-POCUS was 0.97 [95%CI:0.92-1.00].

ConclusionsL-POCUS allows risk-stratification of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. These results should be confirmed in a population with a higher risk of an unfavorable outcome.

171,Exploring the short-term role of particulate matter in the COVID-19 outbreak in USA cities,"The role of particulate matter (PM) in the COVID-19 pandemic is currently being discussed by the scientific community. Long-term (years) exposure to PM is known to affect human health by increasing susceptibility to viral infections as well as to the development of respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. In the short-term (days to months), PM has been suggested to assist airborne viral transmission. However, confounding factors such as urban mobility prevent causal conclusions. In this study, we explore short-term relationships between PM concentrations and the evolution of COVID-19 cases in a number of cities in the United States of America. We focus on the role of PM in facilitating viral transmission in early stages of the pandemic. We analyzed PM concentrations in two particle size ranges, < 2.5 {micro}m, and between 10 and 2.5 {micro}m (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Granger causality analysis was employed to identify instantaneous and lagged effects of pollution in peaks of COVID-19 new daily cases in each location. The effect of pollution in shaping the disease spread was evaluated by correlating the logistic growth rate of accumulated cases with pollutants concentrations for a range of time lags and accumulation windows. PM2.5 shows the most significant results in Granger causality tests in comparison with the other pollutants. We found a strong and significant association between PM2.5 concentrations and the growth rate of accumulated cases between the 1st and 18th days after the report of the infection, peaking at the 8th day. By comparing results of PM2.5 with PM10, CO and NO2 we rule out confounding effects associated with mobility. We conclude that PM2.5 is not a first order effect in the cities considered; however, it plays a significant role in facilitating the COVID-19 transmission. We estimate that the growth rate of COVID-19 cases would be risen by 12.5% if PM2.5 is increased from 25 to 35 {micro}g m-3.",Leonardo Yoshiaki Kamigauti; Gabriel Martins Palma Perez; Carlos Eduardo Souto-Oliveira; Elizabeth Cowdery; Paulo Hilario Nascimento Saldiva; Maria de Fatima Andrade,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253212,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253212,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
172,High-resolution epigenome analysis in nasal samples derived from children with respiratory viral infections reveals striking changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundDNA methylation patterns of the human genome can be modified by environmental stimuli and provide dense information on gene regulatory circuitries. We studied genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal samples from infants (<6 months) applying whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize epigenome response to 10 different respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsWe identified virus-specific differentially methylated regions (vDMR) with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2 followed by Influenza B (Flu B) causing the weakest vs. strongest epigenome response with 496 vs. 78541 and 14361 vDMR, respectively. We found a strong replication rate of FluB (52%) and SARS-CoV-2 (42%) vDMR in independent samples indicating robust epigenome perturbation upon infection. Among the FluB and SARS-CoV-2 vDMRs, around 70% were hypomethylated and significantly enriched among epithelial cell-specific regulatory elements whereas the hypermethylated vDMRs for these viruses mapped more frequently to immune cell regulatory elements, especially those of the myeloid lineage. The hypermethylated vDMRs were also enriched among genes and genetic loci in monocyte activation pathways and monocyte count. Finally, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing characterization of nasal mucosa in response to these two viruses to functionally analyze the epigenome perturbations. Which supports the trends we identified in methylation data and highlights and important role for monocytes.

ConclusionsAll together, we find evidence indicating genetic predisposition to innate immune response upon a respiratory viral infection.

173,Predicting the Efficacy of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donor Units with the Lumit Dx anti-Receptor Binding Domain Assay.,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 that causes COVID-19 has resulted in the death of more than 2.5 million people, but no cure exists. Although passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable therapeutic option, the selection of optimal units for therapy in a timely fashion remains a barrier.

Study design and methodsSince virus neutralization is a necessary characteristic of plasma that can benefit recipients, the neutralizing titers of plasma samples were measured using a retroviral-pseudotype assay. Binding antibody titers to the spike (S) protein were also determined by a clinically available serological assay (Ortho-Vitros total IG), and an in-house ELISA. The results of these assays were compared to a measurement of antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 S protein (Promega Lumit Dx).

ResultsAll measures of antibodies were highly variable, but correlated, to different degrees, with each other. However, the anti-RBD antibodies correlated with viral neutralizing titers to a greater extent than the other antibody assays.

174,What level of neutralising antibody protects from COVID-19? .,"Both previous infection and vaccination have been shown to provide potent protection from COVID-19. However, there are concerns that waning immunity and viral variation may lead to a loss of protection over time. Predictive models of immune protection are urgently needed to identify immune correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we modelled the relationship between in vitro neutralisation levels and observed protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection using data from seven current vaccines as well as convalescent cohorts. Here we show that neutralisation level is highly predictive of immune protection. The 50% protective neutralisation level was estimated to be approximately 20% of the average convalescent level (95% CI = 14-28%). The estimated neutralisation level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level (CI = 0.7-13%, p = 0.0004). Given the relationship between in vitro neutralization titer and protection, we then used this to investigate how waning immunity and antigenic variation might affect vaccine efficacy. We found that the decay of neutralising titre in vaccinated subjects over the first 3-4 months after vaccination was at least as rapid as the decay observed in convalescent subjects. Modelling the decay of neutralisation titre over the first 250 days after immunisation predicts a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralisation titres against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared to the vaccine strain and our model predicts the relationship between neutralisation and efficacy against viral variants. Our analyses provide an evidence-based prediction of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.",David S Khoury; Deborah Cromer; Arnold Reynaldi; Timothy E Schlub; Adam K Wheatley; Jennifer A Juno; Kanta Subbarao; Stephen J Kent; James A Triccas; Miles P Davenport,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21252641,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,True
175,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is extremely vivacious in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic calls for rapid actions, now principally oriented to a world-wide vaccination campaign.

In this study we verified if, in individuals with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single dose of mRNA vaccine would be immunologically equivalent to a full vaccine schedule in naive individuals.

MethodsHealth care workers (184) with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were sampled soon before the second dose of vaccine and between 7 and 10 days after the second dose, the last sampling time was applied to SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals, too.

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay.

The study was powered for non-inferiority. We used non parametric tests and Pearson correlation test to perform inferential analysis.

ResultsAfter a single vaccine injection, the median titer of specific antibodies in individuals with previous COVID-19 was 30,527 U/ml (IQR 19,992-39,288) and in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection was 19,367.5 U/ml (IQR 14,688-31,353) (P=0.032). Both results were far above the median titer in naive individuals after a full vaccination schedule: 1,974.5 U/ml (IQR 895-3,455) (P<0.0001). Adverse events after vaccine injection were more frequent after the second dose of vaccine (mean 0.95, 95%CI from 0.75 to 1.14 versus mean 1.91, 95%CI from 1.63 to 2.19)(P<0.0001) and in exposed compared to naive (mean 1.63; 95%CI from 1.28 to 1.98 versus mean 2.35; 95%CI from 1.87 to 2.82)(P=0.015).

ConclusionIn SARS-CoV-2 naturally infected individuals a single mRNA vaccine dose seems sufficient to reach immunity.

176,"Bromodomain and Extraterminal Protein Inhibitor, Apabetalone (RVX-208), Reduces ACE2 Expression and Attenuates SARS-CoV-2 Infection in vitro","Effective therapeutics are urgently needed to counter infection and improve outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19 and to combat this pandemic. Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells. Moreover, we show that apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to antiviral agents. Taken together, our study supports further evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19, either alone or in combination with emerging therapeutics.

177,Low ozone concentration and negative ions for rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation,"Ozone is a powerful anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral agent, yet exposure to high levels of ozone can pose risks to human/animal health and, in the long term, corrode certain objects. In order to overcome these risks, we evaluated the potential of using a relatively short exposure of a low concentration of ozone to disinfect an indoor environment in the absence of individuals and animals. ICON3 by O3ZONO/M2L, a new disinfection device generating both ozone and negative ions, was selected to assess the potential of this strategy to inactivate different viral isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Tests under controlled laboratory conditions were performed in a system consisting of an ozone-proof airtight plastic box inside a biological safety cabinet, where suspensions of two strains of SARS-CoV-2 were exposed to ozone and negative ions and virucidal activity was measured by means of two complementary methodologies: viral replication capacity and viral titer determination. These studies revealed that low concentration ozone (average 3 ppm after the peak) inactivated up to >99% of SARS-CoV-2 within 20 minutes of exposure. Under controlled conditions, similar ozone exposure was recreated with ICON3 in different volume rooms (15, 30, 60 m3) where a linear relationship was observed between the room volume and the time of continuous ozone/ions flow required to reach and maintain the desired ozone levels used in the laboratory studies. These studies suggest that ICON3 may have the potential for use in the disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments in the absence of individuals and animals, under properly controlled and monitored safety conditions.",Davide De Forni; Barbara Poddesu; Giulia Cugia; Giovanni Gallizia; Massimo La Licata; Julianna Lisziewicz; James G.

178,In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies predict REGEN-COV protection against emergence of viral escape in humans,"Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a clinically validated therapeutic option against COVID-19. As rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of minor virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in nature or identified from preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies and in the clinic. This study demonstrates that a combination of noncompeting antibodies not only provides full coverage against currently circulating variants but also protects against emergence of new such variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical setting.",Richard Copin; Alina Baum; Elzbieta Wloga; Kristen E Pascal; Stephanie Giordano; Benjamin O Fulton; Anbo Zhou; Nicole Negron; Kathryn Lanza; Newton Chan; Angel Coppola; Joyce Chiu; Min Ni; Gurinder S Atwal; Annabel Romero Hernandez; Kei Saotome; Yi Zhou; Matthew C Franklin; Andrea T Hooper; Shane McCarthy; Sara Hamon; Jennifer D Hamilton; Hilary M Staples; Kendra Alfson; Ricardo Carrion Jr.; Shazia Ali; Thomas Norton; Selin Somersan-Karakaya; Sumathi Sivapalasingam; Gary A Herman; David M Weinreich; Leah Lipsich; Neil Stahl; Andrew J Murphy; George D Yancopoulos; Christos A Kyratsous,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434834,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434834,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False
179,Phodopus roborovskii SH101 as a systemic infection model of SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide threat with its unusually high transmission rates and rapid evolution into diverse strains. Unlike typical respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes systemic infection by breaking the boundaries of the respiratory systems. The development of animal models recapitulating the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of utmost importance not only for the development of vaccines and antivirals but also for understanding the pathogenesis. However, there has not been developed an animal model for systemic infection of SARS-CoV-2 representing most aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with systemic symptoms. Here we report that a hamster strain of Phodopus roborovskii SH101, a laboratory inbred hamster strain of P. roborovskii, displayed most symptoms of systemic infection upon SARS-CoV-2 infection as in the case of the human counterpart, unlike current COVID-19 animal models. P. roborovskii SH101 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2 represented most clinical symptoms of COVID-19 such as snuffling, dyspnea, cough, labored breathing, hunched posture, progressive weight loss, and ruffled fur, in addition to high fever following shaking chills. Histological examinations also revealed a serious right-predominated pneumonia as well as slight organ damages in the brain and liver, manifesting systemic COVID-19 cases. Considering the merit of a small animal as well as its clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, this hamster model seems to provide an ideal tool to investigate COVID-19.

Author summaryAlthough the current animal models supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed varying degrees of illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infections of SARS-CoV-2 were mainly limited to the respiratory systems of these animals, including hACE2 transgenic mice, hamsters, ferrets, fruit bats, guinea pigs, African green monkey, Rhesus macaques, and Cynomolgus macaques. While these animal models can be a modest model for the respiratory infection, there is a clear limit for use them in the study of COVID-19 that also displays multiple systemic symptoms. Therefore, the development of an animal model recapitulating COVID-19-specific symptoms such as the right-predominated pneumonia would be the utmost need to overcome the imminent threat posed by COVID-19. We identified a very interesting hamster strain, Phodopus roborovskii SH101, which mimics almost all aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike the current animal models, SARS-CoV-2-infected P. roborovskii SH101 not only displayed the symptoms of respiratory infection but also clinical manifestations specific to human COVID-19 such as high fever following shaking chills, serious right-predominated pneumonia, and minor organ damages in the brain and liver.",Chongkai Zhai; Mingda Wang; Hea-Jong Chung; Md.

180,Emerging variants of concern in SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein: a highly conserved target with potential pathological and therapeutic implications,"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) gene are relatively uncommon. The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulfate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. The rapid emergence of this sub-B.1 clade with recurrent I82T mutation suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434758,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.434758,2021-03-11,2021-03-11,,False

We previously showed protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease and pneumonia in hamsters vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Here, we observed a 9.5-fold reduction of virus neutralizing antibody titer in vaccinated hamster sera against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 did not lose weight compared to control animals. In contrast to control animals, the lungs of vaccinated animals did not show any gross lesions. Minimal to no viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and no infectious virus was detected in lungs of vaccinated animals. Histopathological evaluation showed extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 replication in the control animals, but none in the vaccinated animals.

182,Prediction of COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients in Sudan,"BackgroundCOVID-19 was primarily reported in China. The mortality rate across countries had ranged from 1% up to more than 10% and it is underestimated in some countries. Advanced age is the most frequently reported factor associated to mortality. Other factors were the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. Several models for mortality prediction had been developed to assist in improving the prognosis. The aim of our study was to assess the factors related to mortality among COVID-19 patients and develop a prediction model based on these factors.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study assessed the factors related to the mortality among COVID-19 patients who attended Imperial Hospital isolation centre on November-December, 2020, Khartoum, Sudan. Statistical tests performed were chi-square test, odds ratio and regression to develop the prediction model. Tests were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

Results105 patients were studied. 29% of the patients were deceased, while, 71% were discharged alive. A statistically significant association was found between the age and severity with regards to mortality rate (p=0.034, 0.018 respectively). The model equation for mortality prediction: Mortality = -14.724+ (1.387* Age) + (-0.323* Gender) + (1.814* Admission) + (0.193* Ischemic Heart Disease) + (-0.369* Fever) + (1.595* Cough) + (1.953* Complications) + (0.149* Duration of hospitalization) + (0.999* Enoxaparin dose).

183,Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to baseline antibody status in staff and residents of 100 Long Term Care Facilities (VIVALDI study),"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection represents a major challenge for Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) and many residents and staff are now sero-positive following persistent outbreaks. We investigated the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and subsequent infection in this population.

MethodsProspective cohort study of infection in staff and residents in 100 LTCFs in England between October 2020 and February 2021. Blood samples were collected at baseline (June 2020), 2 and 4 months and tested for IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken weekly in staff and monthly in residents. The primary analysis estimated the relative hazard of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, from Cox regression adjusted for age and gender, and stratified by LTCF.

FindingsStudy inclusion criteria were met by 682 residents and 1429 staff. Baseline IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 residents (33%) and 408 staff (29%). A total of 93 antibody-negative residents had a PCR-positive test (0.054 per month at risk) compared to 4 antibody-positive residents (0.007 per month at risk). There were 111 PCR-positive tests in antibody-negative staff (0.042 per month at risk) compared to 10 in antibody-positive staff (0.009 per month at risk). The adjusted hazard ratios for reinfection in staff and residents with a baseline positive versus negative antibody test were 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.40) and 0.39 ((95% CI: 0.19-0.77) respectively. Of 12 reinfected participants with data on symptoms, 11 were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases.

InterpretationThe presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid) and MedRxiv on 18 January 2021 for studies in LTCFs that described the risk of infection in individuals who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to individuals who were seronegative. Search terms were deliberately broad to improve capture of relevant literature and included ""SARS-CoV-2""OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""coronavirus"" AND ""care home"" OR ""nursing home"" OR ""long term care facility"" with no date or language restrictions. We did not identify any publications that focussed on risk of reinfection in seropositive individuals, but subsequent to our search one study has been published using data from two LTCFs in London, UK. This study reported a 96% reduction in the odds of reinfection in individuals who were seropositive compared to those who were seronegative based on 4-month follow-up in 161 participants. We found 10 studies that performed seroprevalence surveys in either staff or staff and residents in LTCFs in 8 cohorts. Five of these were carried out in response to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within the care homes, either as part of the subsequent investigation or as post-infection surveillance. The largest of these, which enrolled both staff and residents, was performed in 6 LTCFs and performed longitudinal antibody testing.

Added value of this studyWe undertook a cohort study in staff and residents from 100 LTCFs in England to investigate whether individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection could be infected twice. Staff and residents were offered up to three rounds of antibody testing and antibody results were linked to PCR test results which were obtained weekly from staff and monthly from residents through the national SARS-CoV-2 testing programme. This study, which was conducted in >2000 staff and residents, suggests that antibodies provide high levels of protection against reinfection for up to 10 months. Almost all cases of reinfection were symptomatic, but no cases required hospital treatment. Amongst those with detectable baseline antibodies, quantitative antibody titres against spike protein and nucleocapsid were comparable between cases of reinfection and those who did not become reinfected.

Implications of all available evidenceDespite high background rates of infection in LTCFs, the overall risk of reinfection was low in this population. This is broadly consistent with findings from large cohort studies of hospital staff, but, importantly, extends the evidence of substantial protection to frail elderly, who are vulnerable to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 due to age-related changes in immunity (immune-senescence) and high levels of comorbidity. The low risk of reinfection in our study suggests identification of immune correlates of protection in this population will require pooling of data across multiple cohorts.

As vaccination coverage in residents approaches 100% in England, it will be important to understand whether vaccination and natural infection provide comparable levels of protection against infection. Such insights will inform future policy decisions regarding re-vaccination schedules in LTCF, and the longer-term need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as asymptomatic testing and visitor restrictions.",Maria Krutikov; Tom Palmer; Gokhan Tut; Chris Fuller; Madhumita Shrotri; Haydn Williams; Daniel Davies; Aidan Irwin-Singer; James Robson; Andrew Hayward; Paul Moss; Andrew Copas; Laura J Shallcross,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253110,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253110,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,True
184,Detection of autoimmune antibodies in severe but not in moderate or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients,"The heterogeneity of COVID-19 lies within its diverse symptoms and severity, ranging from mild to lethal. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients, characterized by a hyper cytokine storm. Autoimmunity is proposed to occur as a result of COVID-19, given the high similarity of the immune responses observed in COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. Here, we investigate the level of autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients with different severities. Initial screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) IgG revealed that 1.6% (2/126) and 4% (5/126) of ICU COVID-19 cases developed strong and moderate ANA levels, respectively. However, all the non-ICU cases (n=273) were ANA negative. The high ANA level was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IFA) and large-scale autoantibody screening by phage immunoprecipitation-sequencing (PhIP-Seq). Indeed, the majority of the samples showed ""speckled"" ANA pattern by microscopy, and we demonstrate that samples of ICU patients with strong and moderate ANA levels contain autoantibody specificities that predominantly targeted proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, apoptotic processes, and cell death; further denoting reactivity to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. In conclusion, our results further support the notion of routine screening for autoimmune responses in COVID-19 patients, which might help improve disease prognosis and patient management. Further, results provide compelling evidence that ANA-positive individuals should be excluded from being donors for convalescent plasma therapy in the context of Covid-19.",Aisha D.

185,Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vaccinated individuals,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus is consistently evolving with mutations within the receptor binding domain (RBD)1 being of particular concern2-4. To date, there is little research into protection offered following vaccination or infection against RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern (UK3, South African5, Mink6 and Southern California7). To investigate this, serum and saliva samples were obtained from groups of vaccinated (Pfizer BNT-162b28), infected and uninfected individuals. Antibody responses among groups, including salivary antibody response and antibody binding to RBD mutant strains were examined. The neutralization capacity of the antibody response against a patient-isolated South African variant was tested by viral neutralization tests and further verified by an ACE2 competition assay. We found that humoral responses in vaccinated individuals showed a robust response after the second dose. Interestingly, IgG antibodies were detected in large titers in the saliva of vaccinated subjects. Antibody responses showed considerable differences in binding to RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern. A substantial reduction in RBD binding and neutralization was detected for the South African variant. Taken together our data reinforces the importance of administering the second dose of Pfizer BNT-162b2 to acquire high levels of neutralizing antibodies. High antibody titers in saliva suggest that vaccinated individuals may have reduced transmission potential. Substantially reduced neutralization for the South African variant highlights importance of surveillance strategies to detect new variants and targeting these in future vaccines.",Matthias Becker; Alex Dulovic; Daniel Junker; Natalia Ruetalo; Philipp Kaiser; Yudi Pinilla; Constanze Heinzel; Julia Haering; Bjoern Traenkle; Teresa Wagner; Mirjam Layer; Martin Mehrlaender; Valbona Mirakaj; Jana Held; Hannes Planatscher; Katja Schenke-Layland; Gerard Krause; Monika Strengert; Tamam Bakchoul; Karina Althaus; Rolf Fendel; Andrea Kreidenweiss; Michael Koeppen; Ulrich Rothbauer; Michael Schindler; Nicole Schneiderhan-Marra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252958,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252958,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,True

In the context of an ongoing pandemic, it is essential to externally validate widely used tests to assure correct diagnostics and epidemiological estimations. We evaluated the performance of the COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM/A (Vircell, S.L.) against a highly specific and sensitive in-house Luminex immunoassay in a set of samples from pregnant women and cord blood. The agreement between both assays was moderate to high for IgG but low for IgM/A. Considering seropositivity by either IgG and/or IgM/A, the technical performance of the ELISA was highly imbalanced, with 96% sensitivity at the expense of 22% specificity.

187,High levels of common cold coronavirus antibodies in convalescent plasma are associated with improved survival in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundCOVID-19 Convalescent plasma (CCP) is safe and effective, particularly if given at an early stage of the disease. Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP.

Patients and MethodsPatients [&ge;]18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed.

ResultsCCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex.

ConclusionsCommon cold coronavirus spike IgG antibodies anti-HCoV-OC43 and anti-HCoV-HKU1 may target a common domain for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

188,Trends over time in the risk of adverse outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"ObjectivesWe aimed to describe trends in the incidence of adverse outcomes among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between February and September 2020 within a national healthcare system.

SettingUS Veterans Affairs national healthcare system.

ParticipantsEnrollees in the VA healthcare system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 2/28/2020 and 9/30/2020 (n=55,952).

OutcomesDeath, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation within 30 days of testing positive.The incidence of these outcomes was examined among patients infected each month and trends were evaluated using an interrupted time-series analysis.

ResultsBetween February and July 2020, during the first wave of the US pandemic, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), with subsequent stabilization between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and documented symptoms and after additional adjustment for laboratory test results among hospitalized patients, including among subgroups admitted to the ICU and treated with mechanical ventilation. Among hospitalized patients, use of hydroxychloroquine (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%) vasopressors (20.6% to 8.7%), and dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) decreased while use of dexamethasone (3.4% to 53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%) and remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%) increased from February to September.

189,Plasma ACE2 levels predict outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enabling entrance of the virus into cells and causing the infection termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a disease with a very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic and subclinical infection to severe hyperinflammatory syndrome and death.

MethodsThis study used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort with Olink Proteomics). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 outcomes scale. The samples were run on the Olink(R) Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein.

FindingsHigh baseline levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were associated with worse WHOmax category at 28 days with OR=0.56, 95%-CI: 0.44-0.71 (P < 0.0001). This association was significant in regression models with correction for baseline characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and laboratory test results. High levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were also significantly associated with worse WHO category at the time of blood sampling at both day 0, day 3, and day 7 (P = 0.0004, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001, respectively). The levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly higher compared to patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). The plasma ACE2 levels were also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). There was no difference in plasma ACE2 levels comparing patients with or without pre-existing lung disease, diabetes, or immunosuppressive conditions (P = 0.953, P = 0.291, and P = 0.237, respectively). The associations between high plasma levels of ACE2 and worse WHOmax category during 28 days were more pronounced in COVID-19 positive patients compared with COVID-19 negative patients but the difference was not significant in the two-way ANOVA analysis.

InterpretationThis study suggests that measuring ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Further, ACE2 levels could be a link between severe COVID-19 disease and its risk factors, namely hypertension, pre-existing heart disease and pre-existing kidney disease. The design of the data analysis using the Olink platform does not allow assessment of quantitative differences. However, previous studies have described a positive correlation between plasma ACE2 and ACE1 activity. This is interesting because ACE1 (serum ACE) analysis is a standardized test in most hospital laboratories. Therefore, our study encourages quantitative investigations of both plasma ACE 1 and 2 in COVID-19.

190,"Convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","BackgroundTreatment of COVID-19 patients with plasma containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) several possible treatments are being compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to receive either usual care plus high titre convalescent plasma or usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.

FindingsBetween 28 May 2020 and 15 January 2021, 5795 patients were randomly allocated to receive convalescent plasma and 5763 to usual care alone. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1398 (24%) of 5795 patients allocated convalescent plasma and 1408 (24%) of 5763 patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 1{middle dot}00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}93 to 1{middle dot}07; p=0{middle dot}93). The 28-day mortality rate ratio was similar in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including in those patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at randomisation. Allocation to convalescent plasma had no significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days (66% vs. 67%; rate ratio 0{middle dot}98; 95% CI 0{middle dot}94-1{middle dot}03, p=0{middle dot}50). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death (28% vs. 29%; rate ratio 0{middle dot}99; 95% CI 0{middle dot}93-1{middle dot}05, p=0{middle dot}79).

InterpretationAmong patients hospitalised with COVID-19, high-titre convalescent plasma did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes.

ObjectiveTo estimate the prevalence and correlates of persistent COVID-19 symptoms 30 and 60 days post onset using a population-based sample.

Design & SettingThe Michigan COVID-19 Recovery Surveillance Study is a population-based cross-sectional survey of a probability sample of adults with confirmed COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). Respondents completed a survey online or via telephone in English, Spanish, or Arabic between June - December 2020.

ParticipantsLiving non-institutionalized adults (aged 18+) in MDSS with COVID-19 onset through mid-April 2020 were eligible for selection (n=28,000). Among 2,000 adults selected, 629 completed the survey. We excluded 79 cases during data collection due to ineligibility, 6 asymptomatic cases, 7 proxy reports, and 24 cases missing outcome data, resulting in a sample size of 593. The sample was predominantly female (56.1%), aged 45 and older (68.2%), and Non-Hispanic White (46.3%) or Black (34.8%).

ExposuresDemographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and annual household income) and clinical factors (smoking status, body mass index, diagnosed comorbidities, and illness severity).

Main outcomes and MeasuresWe defined post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) as persistent symptoms 30+ days (30-day COVID-19) or 60+ days (60-day COVID-19) post COVID-19 onset.

Results30- and 60-day COVID-19 were highly prevalent (52.5% and 35.0%), even among respondents reporting mild symptoms (29.2% and 24.5%) and non-hospitalized respondents (43.7% and 26.9%, respectively). Low income was statistically significantly associated with 30-day COVID-19 in adjusted models. Respondents reporting very severe (vs. mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30-day COVID-19 (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.46-3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.71, 95% 1.02-2.88). Hospitalized (vs. non-hospitalized) respondents had about 40% higher prevalence of both 30-day (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) and 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.93).

192,Increased mortality among individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 during the second wave in South Africa,"IntroductionSouth Africa experienced its first wave of COVID-19 peaking in mid-July 2020 and a larger second wave peaking in January 2021, in which the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 lineage predominated. We aimed to compare in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves of COVID-19.

MethodsWe analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 hospitalisations. We defined four wave periods using incidence risk for hospitalisation, pre-wave 1, wave 1, pre-wave 2 and wave 2. We compared the characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 cases in wave 1 and wave 2, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality accounting for wave period using multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsPeak rates of COVID-19 cases, admissions and in-hospital deaths in the second wave exceeded the rates in the first wave (138.1 versus 240.1; 16.7 versus 28.9; and 3.3 versus 7.1 respectively per 100,000 persons). The weekly average incidence risk increase in hospitalisation was 22% in wave 1 and 28% in wave 2 [ratio of growth rate in wave two compared to wave one: 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05]. On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 20% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave (adjusted OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3). In-hospital case fatality-risk (CFR) increased in weeks of peak hospital occupancy, from 17.9% in weeks of low occupancy (<3,500 admissions) to 29.6% in weeks of very high occupancy (>12,500 admissions) (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.5).

Compared to the first wave, individuals hospitalised in the second wave, were more likely to be older, 40-64 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.1] and [&ge;]65 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.1] compared to <40 years; and admitted in the public sector [OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.8]; and less likely to have comorbidities [OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5-0.5].

ConclusionsIn South Africa, the second wave was associated with higher incidence and more rapid increase in hospitalisations, and increased in-hospital mortality. While some of this is explained by increasing pressure on the health system, a residual increase in mortality of hospitalised patients beyond this, could be related to the new lineage 501Y.V2.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT O_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyMost countries have reported higher numbers of COVID-19 cases in the second wave but lower case-fatality risk (CFR), in part due to new therapeutic interventions, increased testing and better prepared health systems. South Africa experienced its second wave which peaked in January 2021, in which the variant of concern, SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 predominated. New variants have been shown to be more transmissible and in the United Kingdom, to be associated with increased hospitalisation and mortality rates in people infected with variant B.1.1.7 compared to infection with non-B.1.1.7 viruses. There are currently limited data on the severity of lineage 501Y.V2.

Added value of this studyWe analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 hospitalisations, comparing in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves of COVID-19. The study revealed that after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 20% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave. Our study also describes the demographic shift from the first to the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa, and quantifies the impact of overwhelmed hospital capacity on in-hospital mortality.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur data suggest that the new lineage (501Y.V2) in South Africa may be associated with increased in-hospital mortality during the second wave. Our data should be interpreted with caution however as our analysis is based on a comparison of mortality in the first and second wave as a proxy for dominant lineage and we did not have individual-level data on lineage. Individual level studies comparing outcomes of people with and without the new lineage based on sequencing data are needed. To prevent high mortality in a potential third wave, we require a combination of strategies to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, to spread out the peak of the epidemic, which would prevent hospital capacity from being breached.

Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination.

194,COVID-19 is associated with multiple sclerosis exacerbations that are prevented by disease modifying therapies,"BackgroundInfections can trigger exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS). The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on MS are not known. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on new and pre-existing symptoms of MS.

MethodsThe COVID-19 and MS study is an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort study conducted as part of the United Kingdom MS Register. People with MS and COVID-19 were invited by email to complete a questionnaire about their MS symptoms during the infection. An MS exacerbation was defined as developing new MS symptoms and/or worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms.

ResultsFifty-seven percent (230/404) of participants had an MS exacerbation during their infection; 82 developed new MS symptoms, 207 experienced worsened pre-existing MS symptoms, and 59 reported both. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) reduced the likelihood of developing new MS symptoms during the infection (OR 0.556, 95%CI 0.316-0.978). Participants with a higher pre-COVID-19 webEDSS (web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale) score (OR 1.251, 95%CI 1.060-1.478) and longer MS duration (OR 1.042, 95%CI 1.009-1.076) were more likely to experience worsening of their pre-existing MS symptoms during the infection.

Data on the efficacy of remdesivir in Asian populations are limited, and conflicting results have been reported. The aim of the present study is to examine whether remdesivir is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 or not.

MethodsWe evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir from data acquired from the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of Japanese patients hospitalised with COVID-19, using five-to-one propensity score (PS) matching. Primary outcomes were overall risk of fatality, risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV/ECMO) and length of stay (LoS) in healthcare facilities.

ResultsIn total, 1907 of 15,225 patients met our inclusion criteria. After PS matching, 74 patients were assigned to the remdesivir case group and 195 patients to the non-remdesivir control group. In a PS-matched cohort, fatality risk (12.2% vs 13.3%; P = 1.0); risk of IMV/ECMO (5.4% vs 4.6%; P = 0.757); length of intensive care unit stay (6 vs 6 days; P = 0.473) and length of IMV (13 vs 5 days; P = 0.509) were not different between the case and control groups. LoS in the case group was longer than in the control group (14 vs 11 days; P < 0.001).

We sought to determine how circulating antibody levels change over time following natural infection.

Methods/MaterialsWe conducted a prospective, longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors at multiple time points over a 9-month period. At each study visit, subjects either donated plasma or only had study samples drawn. In all cases, anti-SARS-CoV-2 donor testing was performed using semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassays (ChLIA) targeting subunit 1 (S1) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and an in-house fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA).

ResultsFrom April to November 2020 we enrolled 202 donors, mean age 47.3 {+/-}14.7 years, 55% female, 75% Caucasian. Most donors reported a mild clinical course (91%, n=171) without hospitalization. One hundred and five (105) (52%) donors presented for repeat visits with a median 42 (12-163) days between visits. The final visit occurred at a median 160 (53-273) days post-symptom resolution. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab), SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 97.5%, 91.1%, and 74% of donors respectively at initial presentation. Neutralizing Ab titers based on FRNA50 were positively associated with mean IgG levels (p = <0.0001). Mean IgG levels and neutralizing titers were positively associated with COVID-19 severity, increased donor age and BMI (p=0.0006 and p=0.0028, p=0.0083 and p=0.0363, (p=0.0008 and p=0.0018, respectively). Over the course of repeat visits, IgG decreased in 74.1% of donors; FRNA50 decreased in 44.4% and remained unchanged in 33.3% of repeat donors. A weak negative correlation was observed between total Ab levels and number of days post-symptom recovery (r = 0.09).

ConclusionAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified in 97% of convalescent donors at initial presentation. In a cohort that largely did not require hospitalization. IgG and neutralizing antibodies were positively correlated with age, BMI and clinical severity, and persisted for up to 9 months post-recovery from natural infection. On repeat presentation, IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels decreased in 56% of repeat donors.

198,Structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein monomer,"Coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, present an ongoing threat for human wellbeing. Consequently, elucidation of molecular determinants of their function and interaction with host is an important task. Whereas some of the coronaviral proteins are extensively characterized, others remain understudied. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E protein, a viroporin) in the monomeric form. The protein consists of three parts: hydrophobic -helical transmembrane domain (TMD) and amphiphilic -helices H2 and H3, which are connected by flexible linkers. We show that TMD is tilted in the membrane, with phenylalanines Phe20, Phe23 and Phe26 facing the lumen. H2 and H3 reside at the membrane surface. Orientation of H2 is not affected by glycosylation, but strongly influenced by palmitoylation pattern of cysteines Cys40, Cys43 and Cys44. On the other hand, glycosylation affects the orientation of H3 and prevents its stacking with H2. We also find that the E protein both generates and senses the membrane curvature, preferably localizing with the cytoplasmic part at the convex regions of the membrane. Curvature sensing may be favorable for assembly of the E protein oligomers, whereas induction of curvature may facilitate budding of the viral particles. The presented results may be helpful for better understanding of the function of coronaviral E protein and viroporins in general, and for overcoming the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Alexander Kuzmin; Philipp Orekhov; Roman Astashkin; Valentin Gordeliy; Ivan Gushchin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434722,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434722,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
199,Longitudinal single-cell epitope and RNA-sequencing reveals the immunological impact of type 1 interferon autoantibodies in critical COVID-19,"Type I interferon (IFN-I) neutralizing autoantibodies have been found in some critical COVID-19 patients; however, their prevalence and longitudinal dynamics across the disease severity scale, and functional effects on circulating leukocytes remain unknown. Here, in 284 COVID-19 patients, we found IFN-I autoantibodies in 19% of critical, 6% of severe and none of the moderate cases. Longitudinal profiling of over 600,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single-cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 COVID-19 patients, 15 non-COVID-19 patients and 11 non-hospitalized healthy controls, revealed a lack of IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG-I) response in myeloid cells from critical cases, including those producing anti-IFN-I autoantibodies. Moreover, surface protein analysis showed an inverse correlation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 with ISG-I expression response early in the disease course. This aberrant ISG-I response in critical patients with and without IFN-I autoantibodies, supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression via convergent mechanisms.",Monique G.P. van der Wijst; Sara E.

Here, we use a hamster model of COVID-19 to show that prior infection with a strain representative of the original circulating lineage B of SARS-CoV-2 induces protection from clinical signs upon subsequent challenge with either B1.1.7 or B1.351 viruses, which recently emerged in the UK and South Africa, respectively. The results indicate that these emergent VOC may be unlikely to cause disease in individuals that are already immune due to prior infection, and this has positive implications for overall levels of infection and COVID-19 disease.",Jordan J Clark; Parul Sharma; Eleanor Bentley; Adam C Harding; Anja Kipar; Megan Neary; Helen Box; Grant Hughes; Edward I Patterson; Jo Sharp; Tulio de Oliveira; Alex Sigal; Julian Alexander Hiscox; William S James; Miles W Carroll; Andrew Owen; James P Stewart,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434447,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434447,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
201,Structures and function of locked conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike,"The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in three distinct pre-fusion conformations: locked, closed and open. Of these, the locked conformation was not previously observed for SARS-CoV-1 S and its function remains poorly understood. Here we engineered a SARS-CoV-2 S protein construct ""S-R/x3"" to arrest SARS-CoV-2 spikes in the locked conformation by a disulfide bond. Using this construct we determined high-resolution structures revealing two distinct locked states, with or without the D614G substitution that has become fixed in the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. The D614G mutation induces a structural change in domain D from locked-1 to locked-2 conformation to alter spike dynamics, promoting transition into the closed conformation from which opening of the receptor binding domain is permitted. The transition from locked to closed conformations is additionally promoted by a change from low to neutral pH. We propose that the locked conformations of S are present in the acidic cellular compartments where virus is assembled and egresses. In this model, release of the virion into the neutral pH extracellular space would favour transition to the closed form which itself can stochastically transition into the open form. The S-R/x3 construct provides a tool for the further structural and functional characterization of the locked conformations of S, as well as how sequence changes might alter S assembly and regulation of receptor binding domain dynamics.",Kun Qu; Xiaoli Xiong; Katarzyna A Ciazynska; Andrew P Carter; John A G Briggs,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434733,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.434733,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
202,Potent neutralizing nanobodies resist convergent circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting novel and conserved epitopes,"There is an urgent need to develop effective interventions resistant to the evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2. Nanobodies (Nbs) are stable and cost-effective agents that can be delivered by novel aerosolization route to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections efficiently. However, it remains unknown if they possess broadly neutralizing activities against the prevalent circulating strains. We found that potent neutralizing Nbs are highly resistant to the convergent variants of concern that evade a large panel of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) and significantly reduce the activities of convalescent or vaccine-elicited sera. Subsequent determination of 9 high-resolution structures involving 6 potent neutralizing Nbs by cryoelectron microscopy reveals conserved and novel epitopes on virus spike inaccessible to Abs. Systematic structural comparison of neutralizing Abs and Nbs provides critical insights into how Nbs uniquely target the spike to achieve high-affinity and broadly neutralizing activity against the evolving virus.

203,Development of Equine Immunoglobulin Fragment F(ab')2 with High Neutralizing Capability against SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 has taken the world, and especially the scientific community by storm. While vaccines are being introduced into the market, there is also a pressing need to find potential drugs and therapeutic modules. Remdesivir is one of the antivirals currently being used with a limited window of action. As more drugs are being vetted, passive immunotherapy in the form of neutralizing antibodies can provide immediate action to combat the increasing numbers of COVID-positive cases. Herein, we demonstrate that equines hyper-immunized with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 generate high titers of antibody with a strong virus neutralizing potential. ELISA performed with pooled antisera displayed highest immunoglobulin titer on 42 days post-immunization, at 1:51,200 dilutions. F(ab)2 immunoglobulin fragments generated from the pools also showed very high, antigen-specific affinity at 1:102,400 dilutions. Finally, in vitro virus neutralization assays confirmed that different pools of F(ab)2 fragments could successfully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with titers well above 25,000, indicating the potential of this strategy in treating severe COVID-19 cases with high titers. The F(ab)2 was able to cross neutralize another SARS-CoV-2 strain, demonstrating its efficacy against the emerging viral variants and the importance of this approach in our efforts of eradication of COVID-19. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that virus-neutralizing antibodies raised in equines can potentially be used as a treatment regimen in the form of effective passive immunotherapy to combat COVID-19.",Divya Gupta Ms; Farhan Ahmed Dr; Dixit Tandel Mr; Haripriya Parthasarathy Ms; Dhiviya Vedagiri Ms; Vishal Sah Mr; Krishna Mohan Bodduluru Dr; Siddarth Shreedas Daga Mr; Rafiq Ahmad Khan Mr; Chiranjeevi Kondiparthi Mr; Prabhudas Savari Mr; Sandesh Hajarilal Jain Dr; Jaya Shreedas Daga Ms; Shashikala Reddy Dr; Nooruddin Khan Dr; Krishnan Harinivas Harshan Dr,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434030,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434030,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
204,The dual function monoclonal antibodies VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 demonstrate potent in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2,"VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 are dual action monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 were derived from a parent antibody (S309) isolated from memory B cells of a 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) survivor. Both mAbs contain an ""LS"" mutation in the Fc region to prolong serum half-life and potentially enhance distribution to the respiratory mucosa. In addition, VIR-7832 encodes an Fc GAALIE mutation that has been shown previously to evoke CD8+ T-cells in the context of an in vivo viral respiratory infection. VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 potently neutralize live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in vitro as well as pseudotyped viruses encoding spike protein from the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants. In addition, they retain activity against monoclonal antibody resistance mutations that confer reduced susceptibility to currently authorized mAbs. The VIR-7831/VIR-7832 epitope does not overlap with mutational sites in the current variants of concern and continues to be highly conserved among circulating sequences consistent with the high barrier to resistance observed in vitro. Furthermore, both mAbs can recruit effector mechanisms in vitro that may contribute to clinical efficacy via elimination of infected host cells. In vitro studies with these mAbs demonstrated no enhancement of infection. In a Syrian Golden hamster proof-of concept wildtype SARS-CoV-2 infection model, animals treated with VIR-7831 had less weight loss, and significantly decreased total viral load and infectious virus levels in the lung compared to a control mAb. Taken together, these data indicate that VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 are promising new agents in the fight against COVID-19.",Andrea L Cathcart; Colin Havenar-Daughton; Florian A Lempp; Daphne Ma; Michael Schmid; Maria L Agostini; Barbara Guarino; Julia Di iulio; Laura Rosen; Heather Tucker; Joshua Dillen; Sambhavi Subramanian; Barbara Sloan; Siro Bianchi; Jason Wojcechowskyj; Jiayi Zhou; Hannah Kaiser; Arthur Chase; Martin Montiel-Ruiz; Nadine Czudnochowski; Elisabetta Cameroni; Sarah Ledoux; Christophe Colas; Leah Soriaga; Amalio Telenti; Seungmin Hwang; Gyorgy Snell; Herbert W Virgin; Davide Corti; Christy M Hebner,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434607,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434607,2021-03-10,2021-03-10,,False
205,Cannabidiol Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Promotes the Host Innate Immune Response,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 underscores the need for new treatments. Here we report that cannabidiol (CBD), a compound produced by the cannabis plant, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. CBD and its metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, but not congeneric cannabinoids, potently block SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells. CBD acts after cellular infection, inhibiting viral gene expression and reversing many effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host gene transcription. CBD induces interferon expression and up-regulates its antiviral signaling pathway. A cohort of human patients previously taking CBD had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence of up to an order of magnitude relative to matched pairs or the general population.

Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of mAb-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. mAbs that competed for binding the original S isolate bound differentially to S variants, suggesting the protective importance of otherwise-redundant recognition.

207,Tocilizumab efficacy in COVID-19 patients is associated with respiratory severity-based stages,"BackgroundTocilizumab treatment is investigated, and effectiveness in ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients has been reported. Although controversy exists regarding the efficacy of tocilizumab treatment, it has been suggested that tocilizumab might show positive results depending on patient severity status. We examined an association between tocilizumab and distinct disease severity stages.

Methods and FindingsFrom March 3 to March 23 2020, 494 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients received tocilizumab or standard treatment alone. Data were obtained retrospectively. Clinical respiratory severity (CRS) stages were defined by patient oxygenation status and were also associated to scores of WHO clinical progression scale. We categorized patients in three stages, mild/moderate CRS1 (FiSpO2<0.35; WHO score 5), moderate/severe CRS2 (FiO2=0.5/high flow mask; WHO score 6) and severe/critical CRS3 (FiO2<80%/high flow/prone position or mechanical ventilation; score>6). The primary outcome was the composite of death or ICU admission in patients of stages CRS1, CRS2, and CRS3, as well as in total patients. We also addressed mortality alone in total patients. Kaplan-Maier curves, Cox proportional regression and inverse probability weighting marginal structural models were used. We conducted the study from March 3 to April 7 2020 with broad-ranged severity patients; 167 tocilizumab-treated and 327 untreated. CRS1 patients showed no apparent benefit after treatment, while the risk of the primary outcome was greatly reduced in CRS2 treated participants ((HR=0.22; 95% CI (0.16-0.44)). Moreover, tocilizumab treatment was associated with significantly decreased CRS2 patient proportion that reached the outcome compared to non-treated controls (27.8.0% vs. 65.4%; p<0.001). Severe/critical CRS3 patients, also showed benefit after treatment (HR=0.38; 95% CI (0.16-90)), although not as robust as was that of CRS2 treated individuals. Tocilizumab was associated with reduced outcome risk in total patients (HR=0.42; 95% CI (0.26-0.66)) after CRS adjustment, but not if CRS classification was not accounted as confounding factor (HR=1.19; 95% CI (0.84-1.69)). The outcome of mortality alone upon tocilizumab treatment was significant (HR=0.58; 95% CI (0.35-0.96)) after accounting for CRS classification.

ConclusionsTocilizumab treatment is associated with reduced COVID-19 escalation in CRS2 patients, suggesting efficacy in moderate/severe non-ICU-admitted patients. CRS classification could represent an essential confounding factor in evaluating tocilizumab in studies of broad-ranged severity patients.",Melchor Alvarez-Mon; Angel Asunsolo; Jose Sanz; Benjamin Munoz; Jose Alberto Arranz-Caso; Maria Novella Mena; Cristina Hernandez-Gutierrez; Jorge Navarro; Maria Cristina Lozano Duran; Juan Arevalo Serrano; Rocio Heche Sanchez; Lara Bravo Quiroga; Julio Flores Segovia; Marta Garcia Sanchez; Aida Gutierrez Garcia; Ana Perez; Marta Herrero; Nieves Plana; Daniel Troncoso; Gorjana Rackov; Carlos Martinez-A; Dimitrios Balomenos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252167,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252167,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,True
208,Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland,"In December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant [1, 2, 3].

In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale.

Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirical confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently.

In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

211,Performance and Operational Evaluation of the Access Bio CareStart Rapid Antigen Test in a High-throughput Drive-through Community Testing Site in Massachusetts,"BackgroundTo facilitate deployment of point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated the Access Bio CareStart COVID-19 Antigen test in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site using anterior nasal (AN) swab RT-PCR for clinical testing.

MethodsConsenting symptomatic and asymptomatic children ([&le;]18 years) and adults received dual AN swabs. CareStart testing was performed with temperature/humidity monitoring. All tests had two independent reads to assess inter-operator agreement. Patients with positive CareStart results were called and instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations.

ResultsOf 1603 participants, 1245 adults and 253 children had paired RT-PCR/CareStart results and complete symptom data. 83% of adults and 87% of children were asymptomatic. CareStart sensitivity/specificity were 84.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.1-93.7)/97.2% (92.0-99.4) and 85.7% (42.1-99.6)/89.5% (66.9-98.7) in adults and children, respectively, within 5 days of symptoms. Sensitivity/specificity were 50.0% (41.0-59.0)/99.1% (98.3-99.6) in asymptomatic adults and 51.4% (34.4-68.1)/97.8% (94.5-99.4) in asymptomatic children. Sensitivity in all 234 RT-PCR-positive people was 96.3% with cycle threshold (Ct) [&le;]25, 79.6% with Ct [&le;]30, and 61.4% with Ct [&le;]35. All 21 false positive CareStart tests had faint but normal bands. Inter-operator agreement was 99.5%. Operational challenges included identification of faint test bands and inconsistent swab elution volumes.

214,COVID-19 vaccine distrust in Colombian university students: Frequency and associated variables,"The study aimed to know the frequency and variables associated with COVID-19 vaccine distrust in students of a Colombian university. A cross-sectional study was carried out which participated emerging adult students of a Colombian university. A total of 1,136 students between 18 and 29 years (M= 22.0, SD = 3.0); most of them were female (66.0%), non-health students (82.8%), low-income (79.0%), and residents of urban areas (84.9%). It was frequent low institutional trust (74.8%), low cognitive, social capital (27.9%), low fear of COVID-19 (49.5%), low perceived stress related to COVID-19 (83.5%), and high COVID-19 vaccine distrust (78.9%). Non-health carrier (Adjusted OR = 3.63, 95%CI 2.58-5.10), rural residence (AOR = 1.85, 95%CI 1.13-3.04), low income (AOR = 1.84, 95%CI 1.31-2.57), and perceived stress related to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.74, 95%CI 1.20-2.54) were related to high COVID-19 vaccine distrust. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccine distrust is high among emerging adult Colombian university students.

215,COVID-19 risk score as a public health tool to guide targeted testing: A demonstration study in Qatar,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to develop a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk score to guide targeted RT-PCR testing in Qatar.

MethodsThe Qatar national COVID-19 testing database was analyzed. This database includes a total of 2,688,232 RT-PCR tests conducted between February 5, 2020-January 27, 2021. Logistic regression analyses were implemented to identify predictors of infection and to derive the COVID-19 risk score, as a tool to identify those at highest risk of having the infection. Score cut-off was determined using the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve based on maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. The scores performance diagnostics were assessed.

ResultsLogistic regression analysis identified age, sex, and nationality as significant predictors of infection and were included in the risk score. The scores scoring points were lower for females compared to males and higher for specific nationalities. The ROC curve was generated and the area under the curve was estimated at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.63-0.63). The score had a sensitivity of 59.4% (95% CI: 59.1%-59.7%), specificity of 61.1% (95% CI: 61.1%-61.2%), a positive predictive value of 10.9% (95% CI: 10.8%-10.9%), and a negative predictive value of 94.9% (94.9%-95.0%). The risk score derived early in the epidemic, based on data until only April 21, 2020, had a performance comparable to that of a score based on a year-long testing.

216,Categorizing the Status of COVID-19 Outbreaks Around the World,"Although the SARS-CoV-19 virus spread rapidly around in world in early 2020, disease epidemics in different places evolved differently as the year progressed - and the state of the COVID-19 pandemic now varies significantly across different countries and territories. We have created a taxonomy of possible categories of disease dynamics, and used the evolution of reported COVID-19 cases relative to changes in disease control measures, together with total reported cases and deaths, to allocate most countries and territories among the possible categories. As of 31 January 2021, we find that the disease was (1) kept out or suppressed quickly through quarantines and testing & tracing in 39 countries with 29 million people, (2) suppressed on one or more occasions through control measures in 74 countries with 2.49 billion people, (3) spread slowly but not suppressed, with cases still increasing or just past a peak, in 31 countries with 1.45 billion people, (4) spread through the population, but slowed a result of control measures, leading to a ""flattened curve"" and fewer infections than if the epidemic were unmitigated, in 32 countries with 2.24 billion people, and (5) spread through the population with some but limited mitigation in 5 countries with 168 million people. In addition, several countries have experienced increases in cases after disease appeared to have finished spreading due to declining numbers of susceptible people. For some of these countries - for example Kenya, Pakistan and Afghanistan - the resurgences can be explained by the relaxation of control measures (and may have been enhanced by disease spread in population segments that experienced lower infection levels during the first waves). For other countries, the resurgences point to the effects of new virus variants with higher transmissibility or immunity resistance - including most countries in Southern Africa (where the B.1.351 variant has been identified) and several countries in West Africa (potentially due to the B.1.1.7 or other variants). These findings are consistent with mounting evidence of high infection rates in several low- and middle-income countries, both from seroprevalence studies and estimates of actual deaths from COVID-19 combined with estimates of expected mortality rates. We estimate that 1.3-3.0 billion people, or 17-39% of the global population, have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 to date, and that at least 4.5 million people have died from COVID-19 - much higher than reported cases and deaths. Disease control policies and vaccination strategies should be designed based on the state of the COVID-19 epidemic in the population - and consequently may need to be different in different countries.

Key Points The state of the COVID-19 pandemic varies significantly in different countries and territories around the world - and policies for disease control and vaccination will need to be tailored accordingly.
In any epidemic, there are several possibilities for how the disease will spread over time -and our analysis finds that, in fact, as of 31 January 2021, there were many countries and territories in each of the main categories of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics that might have been expected:
O_LIKept out or suppressed quickly through quarantines and testing & tracing - in 39 countries with 29 million people (0.4% of the global population), mostly small island states and a few countries in Southeast Asia.
C_LIO_LISuppressed through control measures (social distancing, hygiene and testing & tracing) -in 74 countries with 2.49 billion people (31.9% of global population), mostly in Europe, East Asia and the Pacific.
C_LIO_LISpread slowly but not suppressed, with cases still increasing or just past a peak - in 31 countries with 1.45 billion people (18.6% of global population), including many countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as the United States and Russia.
C_LIO_LISpread through the population, but slowed as a result of control measures, leading to a ""flattened curve"" and fewer infections than if the epidemic were unmitigated - in 32 countries with 2.24 billion people (28.8% of global population), mostly in South and Southeast Asia (including India) and Africa.
C_LIO_LISpread through the population with some but limited mitigation or ""flattening the curve"" -in 5 countries with 168 million people (2.2% of global population).
C_LIO_LIExperienced increases in cases after disease appeared to have finished spreading, which in some countries might have been solely due to relaxation of control measures (especially in wealthier population segments which experienced low infection levels during the first wave) - for example in Kenya and in Pakistan and some Central Asian countries - but which in some countries is likely to be due to new virus variants with higher transmissibility or immunity resistance - for example in most countries in Southern Africa and several in West Africa, and possibly also in parts of South and Central America.
C_LI
These findings are backed up by mounting evidence of high infection rates in several low- and middle-income countries. Seroprevalence studies in Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa have reported finding antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in large percentages of the studied populations - and suggest that current infection levels are likely above 50% in each country. Studies of actual deaths due to COVID-19, combined with estimates of expected mortality rates, similarly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has, by now, infected more than half of the populations in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Zambia.
Countries of all income levels, and from all regions, appear in each of the main disease dynamics categories; however, there are clear income and geographical patterns in states of COVID-19 epidemics around the world. Most high-income countries have controlled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through measures. Middle-income countries are spread across all categories, and account for 45 of the 63 countries which have slowed the disease significantly but not fully suppressed it. Some low-income have experienced largely unmitigated susceptibility-driven dynamics, while others have ""flattened the curve"" to varying degrees.
We estimate that between one and two out of every five people globally has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 to date, and that at least 4.5 million people have died from COVID-19. Our estimate of total infections - 1.3-3.0 billion people, or 17-39% of the global population - is between 13 and 30 times the number of confirmed cases, and twice to four times as much as previous estimates of total infection numbers. We estimate that 4.6-10.0 million people have died from COVID-19, between 2.1 and 4.5 times the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.
An estimated 8.9-12.5 million lives remained at risk from COVID-19 as of the end of January 2021, prior to vaccination efforts - mainly in high-income countries (2.4-2.9 million), China (2.1 million) and India (1.7-2.9 million). Vaccinations, of course, have already started to reduce these numbers substantially.
Our analytical approach is simple but useful - providing insight into the epidemic status even in many low-income countries with limited disease monitoring, and with potential to provide early warnings of significant new variants. We compare the evolution of reported cases with changes in stringency of disease control measures, and check that infection levels are plausible given total reported cases and deaths and the income level of the country. Anomalies in which changes in the evolution of reported cases cannot be explained by changes in the stringency index provide indications of possible significant variants of the virus. Up to the end of January, the data provide indications of the presence of significant new variants in:
O_LIMost countries in Southern Africa (where the B.1.351 variant, with higher transmissibility and some resistance to immunity, was first identified in South Africa)
C_LIO_LISeveral countries in West Africa (likely with higher transmissibility and resistance to immunity, possibly the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first identified in the UK and has been found in Ghana and Nigeria, or possibly a different variant).
They also suggest, with less certainty, that the disease dynamics may be affected by new variants in several countries in South and Central America (perhaps the P.1 variant descended from the B.1.1.28 variant which was first identified as coming from the Brazilian Amazon).
C_LI
Different countries should adopt different disease control policies, according to the state of the COVID-19 epidemic in the population.
O_LIFor countries that have kept the disease out or suppressed outbreaks through control measures, their measures need to be kept in place - and potentially strengthened especially in the face of higher-transmissibility variants - until vaccines have been widely administered.
C_LIO_LIFor countries in which the disease is spreading slowly, full control measures should be maintained at least until new case numbers fully decline from the peak; later, it may be possible to relax some measures, but if measures are relaxed too soon or too much after cases peak, then significant further outbreaks can be expected (as has already happened in several such countries).
C_LIO_LIFor countries in which cases have declined following a flattened curve, there may be room to relax control measures that have the greatest negative health, economic and social consequences - but the most effective control measures will need to be maintained (even when cases remain low for extended periods), and measures may need to be strengthened to tackle variants which higher transmissibility or ability to evade immune responses.
C_LIO_LIFor countries in which the disease spread was largely unmitigated, many control measures could be relaxed for most people - although there may be risks if sizeable population segments have much lower infection levels than the general population or from variants with a high degree of immunity resistance.
C_LI
These findings may have implications for the optimal distribution of early batches of vaccines within countries.
O_LIFor countries that have kept the disease out or suppressed outbreaks through control measures, vaccinations should be given first to frontline healthcare and essential workers and to elderly and vulnerable groups (starting with the oldest and most vulnerable).
C_LIO_LIFor countries in which the disease is spreading slowly, detailed modelling should be done to determine whether the optimal strategy is to vaccinate at-risk groups first or to vaccinate key transmitters to halt the outbreak and ""crush the curve"" while waiting for further vaccine supplies to arrive. For any country choosing the key transmitter strategy - as Indonesia has done and has been suggested for the United States - it will be essential to maintain control measures, and to keep higher transmissibility variants out, or otherwise the benefits of a key transmitter vaccination strategy could be lost.
C_LIO_LIFor countries in which the cases declined following a flattened curve, vaccinations should probably be given first to elderly and vulnerable groups, but the optimal strategy may switch to vaccinating key transmitters if there are resurgences in cases due to higher-transmissibility or immunity-resistant variants.
C_LIO_LIFor countries in which the disease spread was largely unmitigated, vaccination should concentrate on elderly and vulnerable people, because population-level immunity already exists, and the greatest danger lies in vulnerable people becoming infected due to endemic SARS-CoV-2 from variants that will likely circulate over many years.
C_LI
These findings may also have implications for the optimal distribution of the first vaccines across countries. For most countries, the optimal allocation of vaccines doses is likely still to be according to population size - as current recommendations suggest. However, the global optimal allocation strategy might include providing somewhat greater supplies, during the next few months, to countries where using the vaccine to halt spread of the disease might be possible (provided that disease control measures are maintained in those countries).
Vaccination strategies will need to account for current and potential future virus variants as well as the likelihood that immunity from vaccination will wane over time. Higher-transmissibility variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus increase the urgency of distributing vaccines in countries which have controlled the disease to date, and may alter the optimal strategy for countries deciding between vaccination first of elderly and vulnerable people or of key transmitters. Immunity-resistant variants of the virus may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines, but are not likely to negate fully the protection they offer. Immunity acquired through vaccination is likely to wane over time - like immunity acquired through infection. In many, perhaps most, countries, the time to vaccinate the whole population will exceed the timeframe in which immunity from vaccination wanes or new immunity-resistant variants emerge. Looking to the longer term, therefore, new virus variants and waning immunity are likely to necessitate re-vaccination (with vaccines tailored to the latest variants) on a regular basis - and the optimal long-term strategies for ongoing vaccination will vary widely across countries and will depend on many factors.

Although the SARS-CoV-19 virus spread rapidly around in world in early 2020, the state of disease epidemics in different countries diverged rapidly as the year progressed. Many high-income countries have had second or third waves; other countries have seen cases continue to increase gradually; still others have experienced declines in cases to low levels after peaks in mid-2020. Facing different situations, different countries might need to adopt different policies in the coming months, including different disease control measures and vaccination strategies.

Each country needs to know its COVID-19 status. There are several possible courses that a disease epidemic can take in a population. The disease can spread rapidly until its runs out of people remaining to infect; the disease can be slowed through social distancing but still spread until large numbers of people are infected and immune; the disease can be suppressed or ""crushed"" through social distancing; or the disease can be kept out completely. More complex disease dynamics will occur when a virus mutates, if new variants evade immune responses in people already infected or spread faster than before, or if the disease spreads differently in different segments of a population. Our research suggests that different countries have experienced outbreaks in each of the main possible categories:

O_LISusceptibility-Driven Dynamics with Limited Mitigation [Category A] - in which the disease spread until it infect most people and declined due to low susceptibility levels (i.e., low share of the population still able to be infected).
C_LIO_LISusceptibility-Driven Dynamics Mitigated by Measures [Categories B and C] - in which the disease curve was ""flattened"" by social distancing, but the disease still spread and declined after infecting large numbers of people (but fewer than if there were no mitigation).
C_LIO_LISusceptibility-plus-Measures-Driven Dynamics [Categories D and E] - in which the disease was slowed significantly but not suppressed, i.e., the curve was ""flattened"" but not ""crushed"", and the disease is still spreading in the population.
C_LIO_LIMeasures-Driven Dynamics [Categories F and G] - in which the disease has been constrained to date mainly through control measures (social distancing, hygiene and testing & tracing), but, of course, could spread again if measures are relaxed because only a minority of the population has been infected.
C_LIO_LIIndex-Case-Control Dynamics [Category H] - in which the disease has been kept out or suppressed to date through strict control measures (especially quarantines and testing & tracing).
C_LIO_LIComplex Disease Dynamics due to Differences Across Population Segments and/or New Variants [Categories I and J, and many countries in Category K] - in which the disease experienced an apparently susceptibility-driven curve but with low overall infection levels (i.e., share of population infected) because some segments of the population have not had many infections, or in which the disease later shows an unexpected resurgence, due to spreading within the previously less-affected population segments or due to the emergence of immunity-evading strains of the virus.
C_LI

From reported data on COVID-19 cases and disease control measures, we can categorize, for most countries and territories, the dynamics of the disease to date. First, we compare the timing of increases and/or decreases in reported new cases with the timing of changes in the ""Stringency Index"" of control measures compiled by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker - and select the appropriate disease dynamics category. Second, we check if the infection levels expected for the category or categories indicated in the first step, are consistent with predicted ranges from the total numbers of reported cases and deaths using plausible ranges for the case detection rate, death detection rate and infection fatality ratio (IFR) given the countrys income level. This approach yields definitive categories for most countries and territories. COVID-19 disease dynamics are complicated in many countries, due to changes in control measures, seasonal patterns, geographical differences within countries, variability in case testing over time and emergence of new variants; such effects can be seen in the reported cases and deaths for many countries, but they do not obscure the basic drivers of disease dynamics - in other words, which of the categories applies - for most countries.

The results suggest that there is a wide variation in the state of the COVID-19 epidemic around the world - as of 31 January 2021 - as illustrated in the map and the table below. COVID-19 has been suppressed through control measures - Categories F, G and H - in 113 countries and territories with 2.52 billion people or about 32.3% of the global population. However, the rest of the world are in different situations. A total of 31 countries, with populations of 1.45 billion people (18.6% of global population), fall into Categories D and E, meaning that the disease spread has been slowed but not suppressed and cases are currently still increasing or just past their peak. In the 23 countries of Category B, home to 2.05 billion people (26.3%), the disease was slowed but not suppressed, and cases have declined fully from the peak. In a further 9 countries with 0.19 billion people (2.5%), the disease spread through the population after initial waves were suppressed. COVID-19 outbreaks in 5 countries with 0.17 billion people (2.2%) were only somewhat mitigated by social distancing and the virus has likely infected most of the population, falling into Category A.

For several countries, which have apparent anomalies and fall outside the ""basic"" categories, the methodology provides important insights into epidemic status - pointing to situations where significant differences may exist across population segments or providing early warnings of new variants with higher transmissibility or resistance to immunity. For 5 Arabian Peninsula countries (3 of which are in Category I) and Singapore, it is likely that the virus has spread widely among migrant worker communities but has been controlled in the rest of the population. Categories J and K include 28 countries in which reported cases have surged after first waves which were likely or possibly susceptibility-driven, with curves flattened to various extents as a result of control measures which mitigated the epidemics. For some countries - including (1) Kenya, (2) Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, and (3) Egypt and Sudan - the second peaks are likely due to relaxation of measures but larger than might be expected due to disproportionate effects of the second waves on population segments (likely more affluent groups) which had lower infection levels during the first waves. For other countries - including (1) most countries in Southern Africa and (2) many countries in West Africa - the data suggest the presence of new virus variants with higher transmissibility and possible resistance to immunity, because resurgences or accelerations in cases happened in several neighbouring countries around the same time, and often without changes in control measures, and the second surges in cases usually involved faster increases than the first waves. The B.1.351 variant, with higher transmissibility and some resistance to immunity, was first identified in South Africa and is known to have caused most cases in the countrys second wave; the B.1.1.7 variant, which has higher transmissibility, has been found in Ghana and Nigeria. Several countries in South and Central America have experienced second waves or surges in cases: Surinames might be due to a higher-transmissibility variant (perhaps the P.1 variant that was first identified as coming from the Brazilian Amazon); Bolivias was large but could be explained by a significant decline in control measures; increases in Brazil and several other countries across South and Central America might simply be due to relaxation of social distancing behaviours over the Christmas and New Year holiday season although a role for virus variants cannot be discounted.

Countries of all income levels appear in each of the main disease dynamics categories; however there are clear correlations between income groups and COVID-19 status categories. Most high-income countries have controlled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through measures (and thus fall in Categories F, G and H). Middle-income countries are spread across all categories, and account for 45 of the 63 countries which have slowed the disease significantly but not fully suppressed it (Categories B, C, D and E). Some low-income countries have experienced largely unmitigated susceptibility-driven dynamics (Category A), while others have ""flattened the curve"" to varying degrees (Categories B, C, D and E). A mix of low- and middle-income countries are among the 34 countries in Categories J and K.

Clear geographical patterns have emerged in the states of COVID-19 epidemics. There was more diversity in the state of the epidemic within regions earlier in the pandemic, but regional patterns had become clear by the end of January 2021.

O_LIIn the Americas, the disease has spread slowly but has not been suppressed (Categories D and E) in most countries, including those with the largest populations, while many (but not all) of the Caribbean islands have kept SARS-CoV-2 out or under control (Category H).
C_LIO_LIWestern and Northern European countries have, for the most part, controlled the disease through social distancing and hygiene measures, through two or three waves, and fall in Categories F and G.
C_LIO_LIAcross Eastern Europe, the Levant, the Caucuses and Iran, all countries have constrained growth of the disease significantly, but infection levels in most have grown to moderate levels: different countries in these regions are included in Categories C, D/E and F/G, although their infection levels may all be in the moderate range.
C_LIO_LIIn South and Central Asia, the virus has spread widely in most countries and cases have declined. In India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Uzbekistan, the case curve was flattened considerably, and current infection levels are likely moderate (Category B). In Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan (all in Category J), there have been two peaks in cases. Bhutan has contained the outbreaks of the virus to date (Category F).
C_LIO_LIMany countries in East and South-East Asia have largely kept the disease under control or kept it out (Categories F, G and H). However, Malaysia, Mongolia and Myanmar experienced widespread outbreaks in the second half of 2020, the Philippines appears to be past the peak of its epidemic (Category B), and Indonesia has had a continuous but very slow rise in cases since the start of the pandemic (Category E).
C_LIO_LIIn Australia, New Zealand and most Pacific Island States, SARS-CoV-2 has been excluded through quarantines, together with testing and tracing and lockdowns when the virus has spread beyond quarantined individuals (Categories F and H).
C_LIO_LIAfrican countries appear to have differed greatly in how the disease has spread. Many countries appear to have experienced widespread epidemics followed by declines in case numbers, with varying degrees of ""curve flattening"" due to control measures (Categories A and B). In some countries - Tunisia, Libya, Togo, Botswana and Mozambique - cases spread very slowly (Categories D and E). A few countries appear to have kept the disease out, and a few others appear to have experienced full outbreaks after having previously kept the virus largely out. As described earlier, most countries in Southern Africa and many in West Africa experienced rapid growth in case numbers in December and January (putting many in Categories J and K) - suggestive of the presence of one or more new variants with higher transmissibility and possible resistance to immunity.
C_LI

We estimate that 1.3-3.0 billion people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 to date, or about 17-39% of the global population. This estimate is between 13 and 30 times the number of confirmed cases, and perhaps twice to four times as much as previous estimates of total infection numbers. We estimate that 4.6-10.0 million people have died from COVID-19, between 2.1 and 4.5 times the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.

An estimated 8.9-12.5 million lives remain at risk from COVID-19, which can be saved through appropriate disease control measures and effective deployment of vaccines. Of these estimated extra deaths, if 90% of the population were to contract SARS-CoV-2, high-income countries account for about 2.4-2.9 million, China for about 2.1 million, and India for about 1.7- 2.9 million. Vaccinations, of course, have already started to reduce these numbers substantially.

The findings of this report are backed up by mounting evidence of high infection rates in several low- and middle-income countries. Immunity testing provides direct evidence of the current state of the COVID-19 epidemic. Serological studies in several cities and regions in Brazil, India, Kenya, Pakistan, Qatar and South Africa have already reported finding antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in large percentages of the studied populations. Note, however, that serological testing will underestimate the number of people who have been infected, due to waning of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which affects significant numbers of people at about 4-6 months after infection. Consequently, serological testing might understate the actual degree of immunity in a population, because some people may have antibodies at levels below the detection threshold of the serology tests or may have memory B cell or T cell responses, either or both of which will likely reduce the severity of their illness if reinfected, and may reduce their vulnerability to reinfection and their likelihood to pass on the virus to other people if reinfected. In some places, reliable estimates of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be a substitute for immunity testing to determine the share of population infected to date, at least approximately. Estimates, using a variety of methodologies, in Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Zambia all indicate that moderate to high shares of their populations have already been infected.

Different countries should adopt different disease control policies, according to the state of the COVID-19 epidemic in the population. The following recommendations for countries in different categories take into account their current infection levels and the potential for additional infections if measures are relaxed or if new variants become common in a country.

[tpltrtarr]Category A: Control measures should be relaxed for most people; such relaxation is not likely to lead to many more cases and deaths. In some low- and middle-income countries, wealthier population segments may have implemented greater degrees of social distancing during the epidemic to date, and have much lower infection levels than in the overall population; these segments should maintain social distancing, until vaccines arrive, because otherwise they could experience substantial outbreaks (which may have generated ""second waves"" in some countries). If and when new virus strains with higher transmissibility and/or resistance to immunity arrive, control measures should be strengthened again to avoid new outbreaks, if the new variants cause high mortality levels and if it seems likely that control measures will be more effective at controlling the new outbreaks than they were during the initial outbreaks.
[tpltrtarr]Categories B and C: Control measures currently in place that have the greatest negative health, economic and social consequences could be relaxed. However, many control measures, especially the most effective in limiting virus spread, will need to be maintained, even though current case numbers are low; otherwise, significant resurgences can take place (as has happened, for instance, in Kenya and Bolivia). Population segments that may have maintained lower infection levels during the outbreak to date will need to maintain social distancing. If and when new virus strains with higher transmissibility and/or resistance to immunity arrive, control measures will likely have to be strengthened again to avoid new outbreaks.
[tpltrtarr]Categories D and E: Control measures should be maintained at least until new case numbers fully decline from the peak; if measures are relaxed too soon after cases peak, then significant further outbreaks can be expected (as has happened, for instance, in Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay). Once cases fully decline from the peak - through further infections or as a result of vaccination programmes - then, and only then, some of the disease control measures with the greatest negative health, economic and social consequences could be relaxed. For some countries in Categories D and E, it may be possible to push R0_e below 1 and hence ""crush the curve"" by introducing some additional control measures or improving compliance with existing measures. New virus strains, especially with higher transmissibility, can generate resurgences or accelerations in growth of cases (as seen, for example, in Mozambique and Togo).
[tpltrtarr]Categories F and G: COVID-19 control measures, put in place by governments and implemented by citizens, have saved perhaps 13.1-14.2 million lives. To continue to protect these lives, control measures need to be maintained until vaccines become widely available - and strengthened, if necessary, to compensate for new virus variants with higher transmissibility.
[tpltrtarr]Category H: Measures to keep the disease out - mainly strict quarantines for new arrivals and testing & tracing of suspected cases - should be maintained until vaccines become widely available.


The findings of this report may have implications for the optimal distribution of early batches of vaccines within countries. Current policies in several countries call for deployment of vaccines first to healthcare workers and then by age cohort, starting with the oldest. These plans are aligned with the results of modelling (by Imperial College London and others) which suggest that, when the supply of vaccines is limited, the optimal strategy is to target the elderly and other high-risk groups. However, the models indicate that, if the supply is sufficient to stop transmission of the virus, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters (e.g., working age people and potentially children) to indirectly protect the elderly and vulnerable. Consequently, the optimal strategy may vary according to the disease status category for each country:

[tpltrtarr]Category A: Vaccination should concentrate on elderly and vulnerable people, starting with the oldest and most vulnerable. There is no alternative strategy to consider because population-level immunity already exists, and the greatest danger lies in vulnerable people becoming infected due to endemic SARS-CoV-2.
[tpltrtarr]Categories B and C: Vaccinations should probably be given first to elderly and vulnerable groups, and to frontline healthcare and other essential workers. However, if there are resurgences in cases across the population due to higher-transmissibility or immunity-resistant variants, then the optimal strategy may switch to targeting key transmitters, similar to some countries in Categories D and E.
[tpltrtarr]Categories D and E: In some of these countries, the optimal strategy may to be vaccinate key transmitters - while maintaining current disease control measures - because it may be possible to halt the outbreak and ""crush the curve"", while waiting for further vaccine supplies to arrive (after which disease control measures could be released). This strategy is being pursued by Indonesia and was suggested for the United States of America in a recent paper. However, careful modelling and planning would be necessary, for any country considering such an approach, to determine if a key transmitter strategy would in fact be optimal and if it would be feasible to implement. Further, for such a strategy to work, it will be necessary to keep control measures in place and to keep high-transmissibility variants of the virus out, until enough people have been vaccinated.
[tpltrtarr]Categories F, G and H: Vaccinations should be given first to frontline healthcare and other essential workers and to elderly and vulnerable groups (starting with the oldest and most vulnerable).


These findings may also have implications for the optimal distribution of the first vaccines across countries. Modelling by the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team suggests that the optimal allocation of vaccine doses among countries ""is sensitive to many assumptions and will vary depending both on the vaccine characteristics and the stage of the epidemic in each country at vaccine introduction,"" and concluded that, ""[g]iven this uncertainty, allocating vaccine doses according to population size appears to be the next most efficient approach."" Our findings reinforce the uncertainty strongly: it is very likely that that stage of the epidemic varies greatly across countries. For most countries, the optimal allocation of vaccines doses is likely still to be according to population size - and then for those countries to give doses first to elderly and vulnerable people. However, the global optimal allocation strategy might include providing somewhat greater supplies, during the next few months, to Category D and E countries where using the vaccine to halt spread of the disease might be possible (provided that disease control measures are maintained in those countries). It is clear, in any case, that further modelling of vaccine allocation strategies is essential, taking into account the actual vaccine efficacies and projected available doses by month, as well as allowing for disease stage categories in different countries.

Vaccination strategies will need to account for current and potential future virus variants as well as the likelihood that immunity from vaccination will wane over time. Higher-transmissibility variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus increase the urgency of distributing vaccines, especially in Category F and G countries which may struggle to keep the disease suppressed, and might cause vaccination of key transmitters to be a less effective strategy for Category D and E countries if higher-transmissibility variants mean that they cant suppress the disease fully with limited vaccinations. Immunity-resistant variants of the virus may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines, but are not likely to negate fully the protection offered by existing vaccines. Immunity acquired through vaccination is likely to wane over time - like immunity acquired through infection. Looking to the longer term, new virus variants and waning immunity are likely to necessitate re-vaccination (with vaccines effective against the latest variants) on a regular basis. In many, perhaps most, countries, the time to vaccinate the whole population will exceed the timeframe in which immunity from vaccination wanes or new immunity-resistant variants emerge. In making long-term plans, therefore, countries may face a wide range of options for who to vaccinate (elderly and vulnerable populations, key transmitters or entire populations) and for frequency of vaccination (every 6 months, annual, or once if residual benefits are sufficient). Optimal strategies for each country will be complicated to determine, as the choice will depend on many factors, including vaccine effectiveness in reducing mortality and in reducing transmission, how effectiveness wanes over time, mortality rates and transmissibility of new variants (in general and in previously infected or vaccinated people), and, once the risks to life and health from ""endemic COVID"" decrease to the point where COVID-19 is not an overriding issue, comparison with other health and budgetary priorities.",John Paul Callan; Carlijn J.

217,A quantitative risk estimation platform for indoor aerosol transmission of COVID-19,"Aerosol transmission has played a significant role in the transmission of COVID-19 disease worldwide. We developed a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation platform to better understand how key parameters associated with indoor spaces and infector emissions affect inhaled deposited dose of aerosol particles that convey the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The model calculates the concentration of size-resolved, virus-laden aerosol particles in well-mixed indoor air challenged by emissions from an index case(s). The model uses a mechanistic approach, accounting for particle emission dynamics, particle deposition to indoor surfaces, ventilation rate, and single-zone filtration. The novelty of this model relates to the concept of ""inhaled & deposited dose"" in the respiratory system of receptors linked to a dose-response curve for human coronavirus HCoV-229E. We estimated the volume of inhaled & deposited dose of particles in the 0.5 to 4 m range expressed in picoliters (pL) in a well-documented COVID-19 outbreak in restaurant X in Guangzhou China. We anchored the attack rate with the dose-response curve of HCoV-229E which provides a preliminary estimate of the average SARS-CoV-2 dose per person, expressed in plaque forming units (PFUs). For a reasonable emission scenario, we estimate approximately three PFU per pL deposited, yielding roughly 10 PFUs deposited in the respiratory system of those infected in Restaurant X. To explore the platforms utility, we tested the model with four COVID-19 outbreaks. The risk estimates from the model fit reasonably well with the reported number of confirmed cases given available metadata from the outbreaks and uncertainties associated with model assumptions.

Practical ImplicationsThe model described in this paper is more mechanistic in nature than standard probabilistic models that fail to account for particle deposition to indoor materials, filtration, and deposition of particles in the respiratory system of receptors. As such, it provides added insights into how building-related factors affect relative infection risk associated with inhaled deposited dose. An online version of this mechanistic aerosol risk estimation platform is available at Safeairspaces.com. Importantly, the modular nature of this approach allows for easy updates when new information is available regarding dose-response relationships for SARS-CoV-2 or its variants.",Hooman Parhizkar; Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg; Charles Haas; Richard Corsi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252990,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252990,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,True
218,"Effectiveness of a telerehabilitation program for COVID-19 survivors (TERECO) on exercise capacity, pulmonary function, lower limb muscle strength, and quality of life: a randomised controlled trial","ObjectivesTo investigate superiority of a telerehabilitation program for Covid-19 (TERECO) over no rehabilitation with regard to functional exercise capacity, lower-limb muscle strength (LMS), pulmonary function, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and perceived dyspnoea.

DesignParallel-group randomised controlled-trial with 1:1 block-randomisation.

SettingThree major hospitals from Jiangsu and Hubei provinces, China.

Participants120 Covid-19 survivors with modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score of 2-3 who had been discharged from hospital were randomised. 61 were allocated to the control group and 59 to the TERECO group.

InterventionThe control group received educational instructions. The TERECO group participated in a 6-week home-based, pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered via smartphone and monitored with chest-worn heart rate telemetry. Exercise types comprised breathing control and thoracic expansion, aerobic exercise, and LMS exercise.

OutcomesPrimary outcome was 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) in metres. Secondary outcomes were LMS measured as squat time in seconds; pulmonary function assessed by spirometry with parameters being forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), and peak expiratory flow; HRQOL measured with SF-12 physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS); and mMRC dyspnoea, favourable outcome (no dyspnoea). Outcomes were assessed at 6 weeks (post-treatment) and 28 weeks (follow-up).

Results120 patients were randomised, 15 (12.5%) were lost to follow-up at study endpoint. No serious adverse events occurred. 38 participants in the TERECO group complied with the exercise protocol (64.41% of randomized). The adjusted between-group difference in change in 6MWD from baseline was 65.45 metres (95% CI 43.8-87.1, p<0.001) at post-treatment and 68.62 metres (95% CI 46.39-90.85, p<0.001) at follow-up. Treatment effects for LMS were 20.12 seconds (95% CI 12.34-27.9, p<0.001) post-treatment and 22.23 seconds (95% CI 14.24-30.21, p<0.001) at follow-up. No group differences were found for lung function apart from post-treatment MVV (10.57 litres/minute, 95% CI 0.26-17.88, p=0.005). Increase in SF-12 PCS was greater in the TERECO group with treatment effects estimated as 3.79 (95% CI 1.24-6.35, p=0.004) at post-treatment and 2.69 (95% CI 0.06-5.32, p=0.045) at follow-up. No significant between-group differences were found for improvements in SF-12 MCS. At post-treatment 90.4% endorsed a favourable outcome for mMRC dyspnoea in the TERECO group vs. 61.7% in control (adjusted RR 1.46, 1.17-1.82, p=0.001).

ConclusionsThis trial demonstrated superiority of TERECO over no rehabilitation for 6MWD, LMS, and SF-12 PCS. We found no persistent effects on pulmonary function, SF-12 MCS, and perceived dyspnoea.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSWhat is already knownC_ST_ABSMany Covid-19 survivors discharged from hospital have reduced exercise capacity, impaired pulmonary function, muscle weakness, and reduced quality of life, all of which might be addressed with pulmonary rehabilitation.

However, evidence on effective pulmonary rehabilitation measures for this population is currently lacking. As delivery of conventional rehabilitation services is furthermore limited due to pandemic control measures, telerehabilitation programs represent a possible alternative.

What the study addsWe developed a telerehabilitation program for Covid-19 survivors (TERECO program) that is delivered via smartphone and can be carried out at home.

Our study suggests that TERECO was safe and participants of the TERECO program had improved exercise capacity, lower-limb muscle strength, and physical quality of life. No relevant group differences were found for lung function, self-reported breathlessness, and mental quality of life.

The TERECO program is inexpensive and could be implemented on a large scale to improve physical health of Covid-19 survivors after discharge from hospital.",Jian'an Li; Wenguang Xia; Chao Zhan; Shouguo Liu; Zhifei Yin; Jiayue Wang; Yufei Chong; Chanjuan Zheng; Xiaoming Fang; Wei Cheng; Jan D.

We use machine-learning algorithms to predict communities at a high risk of VH relying on area-level indicators easily available to policymakers. We illustrate our approach on data from child immunization campaigns for seven non-mandatory vaccines carried out in 6408 Italian municipalities in 2016. A battery of machine learning models is compared in terms of area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. We find that the Random Forest algorithm best predicts areas with a high risk of VH improving the unpredictable baseline level by 24% in terms of accuracy. Among the area-level indicators, the proportion of waste recycling and the employment rate are found to be the most powerful predictors of high VH.

Polyclonal antibody responses in vaccinees were robust and comparable to or exceeded those seen after natural infection. However, that the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was greater than that after natural infection and, at the monoclonal level, we found that the majority of vaccine-induced antibodies did not have neutralizing activity. We also found a co-dominance of mAbs targeting the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike and an original antigenic-sin like backboost to seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins.

222,SARS-COV-2 antibody prevalence in patients on dialysis in the US in January 2021,"BackgroundTo estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the US, the country with the worlds largest absolute numbers of COVID19 cases and deaths, we conducted a cross-sectional assessment from a sample of patients receiving dialysis in January 2021.

MethodsWe tested remainder plasma of 21,424 patients receiving dialysis through the third-largest US dialysis organization, with facilities located nationwide. We used the Siemens spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody assay to estimate crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and then estimated seroprevalence for the US dialysis and adult population by standardizing by age, sex and region. We also compared January 2021 seroprevalence and case-detection rates to that from a similar subsample of patients receiving dialysis who had been tested in July 2020.

ResultsPatients in the sample were disproportionately from older age and minority race/ethnic groups. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 18.9% (95% CI: 18.3-19.5%) in the sample, 18.7% (18.1-19.2%) standardized to the US dialysis population, and 21.3% (20.3-22.3%) standardized to the US adult population (range 15.3-20.8% in the Northeast and South respectively). Younger age groups (18-44 years), and persons self-identifying as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods, and persons living in the poorest neighborhoods were among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence (25.9% (24.1-27.8%), 25.1% (23.6-26.4%), 24.8% (23.2-26.5%) respectively). Compared to data from July 2020, we observed diminished variability in seroprevalence by geographic region and urban-rural status. Estimated case detection rate increased from 14% to 23% in July 2020 to January 2021.

ConclusionsA year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the US, fewer than one in four adults have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Vaccine roll out to majority minority neighborhoods and poorer neighborhoods will be critical to disrupting the spread of infection.

223,"Single-Arm, Open-Label Phase 2 Trial of Preemptive Methylprednisolone to Avert Progression to Respiratory Failure in High-Risk Patients with COVID-19","IntroductionCovid-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by a viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until seven days later. This is followed by a second and third phase, initially characterized by the appearance of lung infiltrates, followed in 20% by respiratory failure. The second phase is usually heralded by an elevation of serologic inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, IL-6, LDH as well as D-dimers. Approximately 20% proceed to the second phase and are usually then treated with dexamethasone, provided they are oxygen-dependent since these are the only cases that benefit from dexamethasone. If we had objective criteria to predict this 20% that develop severe illness, they could preemptively be treated with steroids. In this exploratory study we investigated the early use of preemptive steroids in the setting of early disease, in high-risk non-oxygen dependent cases.

MethodsEligible patients were those 21 years or older with a diagnosis of Covid-19 and oxygen saturation [&ge;]91%. For patients to be classified as high-risk, they had to exhibit two or more of the following abnormalities 7-10 days after first symptom: IL-6 [&ge;] 10 pg/ml, ferritin > 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L (1,000 ng/ml), CRP > 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L), LDH above normal range lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count <1,000 /{micro}L), oxygen saturation between 91-94%, or CT chest with evidence of ground glass infiltrates. Primary endpoint was progression to respiratory failure. CALL score method was used to predict the expected number of cases of respiratory failure. High risk patients received methylprednisolone (MPS) 80 mg IV daily x 5 days starting no earlier than seven days from first onset of symptoms. The primary endpoint was progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure defined as PaO2 <60 mm Hg or oxygen saturation [&le;]90%. Secondary endpoints included survival at 28 days from registration, admission to intensive care and live discharge from the hospital. Change in levels of inflammatory markers and length of hospitalization were also assessed.

Interim report on an observational, longitudinal sampling study of infected children, contacts, and the environment","BackgroundTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and young people in school settings has not been directly evaluated, nor the main mechanisms of transmission identified. The study set out to undertake sequential longitudinal sampling of infected children, their contacts, and the environment.

MethodsCases of COVID-19 were identified through statutory notification and matched to schools reporting cases. Cases of COVID-19 and their contacts from school and home were longitudinally sampled and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Surfaces and air in the home and school environment were also subject to longitudinal sampling and testing.

ResultsOnward transmission of virus to immediate classroom members who participated in the study was not detected. Evidence of more widespread transmission among children remaining in school was not identified with the exception of one unexpected cluster of three asymptomatic cases in one school. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in this study shed viral RNA for up to 10 days from symptom onset, with levels peaking at 5-8 days. Viral RNA was identified in the environment around children who were actively shedding virus in the home, but limited contamination was identified in schools. Variant of Concern B1.1.7 was identified in later cases studied.

225,Vaccine effectiveness after 1st and 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in long-term care facility residents and healthcare workers - a Danish cohort study,"BackgroundAt the end of 2020, Denmark launched an immunization program against SARS-CoV-2. The Danish health authorities prioritized persons currently living in long-term care facilities (LTCF residents) and frontline healthcare workers (HCW) as the first receivers of vaccination. Here we present preliminary population based vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates in these two target groups.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective registry- and population-based observational cohort study including all LTCF residents and all HWC. The outcome was a polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and VE was estimated for different periods following first and second dose. We used Poisson and Cox regressions to estimate respectively crude and calendar time-adjusted VE for the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for vaccinated versus unvaccinated.

ResultsA total of 39,040 LTCF residents (median age at first dose; 84 years, Interquartile range (IQR): 77-90) and 331,039 HCW (median age at first dose; 47 years, IQR: 36-57) were included. Among LTCF residents, 95.2% and 86.0% received first and second dose from 27 December 2020 until 18 February 2021, for HWC the proportion was 27.8% and 24.4%. During a median follow-up of 53 days, there were 488 and 5,663 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the unvaccinated groups, whereas there were 57 and 52 in LTCF residents and HCW within the first 7 days after the second dose and 27 and 10 cases beyond seven days of second dose. No protective effect was observed for LTCF residents after first dose. In HCW, VE was 17% (95% CI; 4-28) in the > 14 days after first dose (before second dose). Furthermore, the VE in LTCF residents at day 0-7 of second dose was 52% (95% CI; 27-69) and 46% (95% CI; 28-59) in HCW. Beyond seven days of second dose, VE increased to 64% (95% CI; 14-84) and 90% (95% CI; 82-95) in the two groups, respectively.

ConclusionThe results were promising regarding the VE both within and beyond seven days of second vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine currently used in many countries to help mitigate the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Impact of the researchSo far, observational studies of the real-word effectiveness of the mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has been limited to the period after the administration of the first dose. This is the first report to date to present vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates after the second BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine. We estimated a VE of 52% and 46% in LTCF residents and HCW within seven days, which increased to 64% and 90% in the two groups respectively beyond seven days of immunization. These findings supports maintaining a two-dose schedule of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine.",Ida Rask Moustsen-Helms; Hanne-Dorthe Emborg; Jens Nielsen; Katrine Finderup Nielsen; Tyra Grove Krause; Kaare Molbak; Karina Lauenborg Moeller; Ann-Sofie Nicole Berthelsen; Palle Valentiner-Branth,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252200,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252200,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,True
226,Beliefs about Mask Efficacy and the Effect of Social Norms on Mask Wearing Intentions for COVID-19 Risk Reduction,"In the absence of widespread vaccination for COVID-19, governments and public health officials have advocated for the public to wear masks during the pandemic. The decision to wear a mask in public is likely affected by both beliefs about its efficacy and the prevalence of the behavior. Greater mask use in the community may encourage others to follow this norm, but it also creates an incentive for individuals to free ride on the protection afforded to them by others. We report the results of two vignette-based experiments conducted in the United States and Italy to examine the causal relationship between beliefs, social norms, and reported intentions to engage in mask promoting behavior. We find that providing factual information about how masks protect others increases the likelihood that someone would wear a mask or encourage others to do so in the United States, but not in Italy. There is no effect of providing information about how masks protect the wearer in either country. Additionally, greater mask use increases intentions to wear a mask and encourage someone else to wear theirs properly in both the United States and Italy. Thus, community mask use may be self-reinforcing.",Scott E Bokemper; Maria Cucciniello; Tiziano E Rotesi; Paolo Pin; Amyn A Malik; Kathryn Willebrand; Elliott E Paintsil; Saad B Omer; Gregory A Huber; Alessia Melegaro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252722,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252722,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,True
227,Spike mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants confer resistance to antibody neutralization,"New SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge from the current global pandemic, some of which can replicate faster and with greater transmissibility and pathogenicity. In particular, UK501Y.V1 identified in UK, SA501Y.V2 in South Africa, and BR501Y.V3 in Brazil are raising serious concerns as they spread quickly and contain spike protein mutations that may facilitate escape from current antibody therapies and vaccine protection. Here, we constructed a panel of 28 SARS CoV 2 pseudoviruses bearing single or combined mutations found in the spike protein of these three variants, as well as additional nine mutations that within or close by the major antigenic sites in the spike protein identified in the GISAID database. These pseudoviruses were tested against a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including some approved for emergency use to treat SARS CoV 2 infection, and convalescent patient plasma collected early in the pandemic. SA501Y.V2 pseudovirus was the most resistant, in magnitude and breadth, against mAbs and convalescent plasma, followed by BR501Y.V3, and then UK501Y.V1. This resistance hierarchy corresponds with Y144del and 242-244del mutations in the N-terminal domain as well as K417N/T, E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD). Crystal structural analysis of RBD carrying triple K417N E484K N501Y mutations found in SA501Y.V2 bound with mAb P2C-1F11 revealed a molecular basis for antibody neutralization and escape. SA501Y.V2 and BR501Y.V3 also acquired substantial ability to use mouse and mink ACE2 for entry. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate major antigenic shifts and potentially broadening the host range of SA501Y.V2 and BR501Y.V3, which pose serious challenges to our current antibody therapies and vaccine protection.",Ruoke Wang; Qi Zhang; Jiwan Ge; Wenlin Ren; Riu Zhang; Jun Lan; Bin Ju; Bin Su; Fengting Yu; Peng Chen; Huiyu Liao; Yingmei Feng; Xuemei Li; Xuanling Shi; Zheng Zhang; Fujie Zhang; Qiang Ding; Tong Zhang; Xinquan Wang; Linqi Zhang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434497,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434497,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
228,The N501Y spike substitution enhances SARS-CoV-2 transmission,"Beginning in the summer of 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in the United Kingdom (UK). This B.1.1.7 variant increased rapidly in prevalence among sequenced strains, attributed to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency. The UK variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 UK spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant responsible for increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil and South Africa, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.",Yang Liu; Jianying Liu; Kenneth S.

229,Systemic Tissue and Cellular Disruption from SARS-CoV-2 Infection revealed in COVID-19 Autopsies and Spatial Omics Tissue Maps,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has infected over 115 million people and caused over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, as well as what distinguishes them from common seasonal influenza virus and other lung injury states such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), remains poorly understood. To address these challenges, we combined transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues, matched with spatial protein and expression profiling (GeoMx) across 357 tissue sections. These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. In particular, cardiac and lung tissues revealed the largest degree of splicing isoform switching and cell expression state loss. Overall, these findings reveal a systemic disruption of cellular and transcriptional pathways from COVID-19 across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19, as well to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viruses.",Jiwoon Park; Jonathan Foox; Tyler Hether; David Danko; Sarah Warren; Youngmi Kim; Jason Reeves; Danel J Butler; Christopher Mozsary; Joel Rosiene; Alon Shaiber; Ebrahim Afshinnekoo; Matthew MacKay; Yaron Bram; Vasuretha Chandar; Heather Geiger; Arryn Craney; Priya Velu; Ari M Melnick; Iman Hajirasouliha; Afshin Beheshti; Amanda Saravia-Butler; Eve Syrkin Wurtele; Jonathan Schisler; Samantha Fenessey; Andre Corvelo; Michael C Zody; Soren Germer; Steven Salvatore; Shawn Levy; Shixiu Wu; Nicholas Tatonetti; Sagi Shapira; Mirella Salvatore; Massimo Loda; Lars F Westblade; Melissa Cushing; Hanna Rennert; Alison J Kriegel; Olivier Elemento; Marcin Imielinski; Alain C Borczuk; Cem Meydan; Robert E Schwartz; Christopher E Mason,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434433,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434433,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
230,Quantitative proteomics of hamster lung tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 reveal host-factors having implication in the disease pathogenesis and severity,"Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) manifests lung pathology that resembles human COVID-19 patients. In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARS-CoV-2 isolate in hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute infection and convalescence. The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate in vivo. Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples shows a similar type of pathophysiological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection as reported earlier in COVID-19 patients and hamsters infected with other isolates. The lung-associated pathological changes were very prominent on the 4th day post-infection (dpi), mostly resolved by 14dpi. Here, we carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at day 4 and day 14 post infection. This resulted in the identification of 1,585 differentially expressed proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered among both the infected groups. Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet activation, ferroptosis and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways. In addition, we also identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins (Sftpd and Sftpb), known for their protective role in lung function. Together, these findings will aid in the identification of candidate biomarkers and understanding the mechanism(s) involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

231,In vitro rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by visible light photocatalysis using boron-doped bismuth oxybromide,"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and on surfaces is critical to prevent the fecal-oral and fomite transmission, respectively. We hypothesized that visible light active photocatalysts could dramatically enhance the rate or extent of virus inactivation and enable the use of visible light rather than shorter wavelength ultraviolet light. A novel visible light active photocatalyst, boron-doped bismuth oxybromide (B-BiOBr), was synthesized and tested for its SARS-CoV-2 inactivation towards Vero E6 cell lines in dark and under irradiation at 426 nm by a light emitting diode (LED) in water. SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence of B-BiOBr (0.8 g/L) under LED irradiation reached 5.32-log in 5 min, which was 400 to 10,000 times higher than those achieved with conventional photocatalysts of tungsten or titanium oxide nanomaterials, respectively. Even without LED irradiation, B-BiOBr inactivated 3.32-log of SARS-CoV-2 in the dark due to the ability of bismuth ions interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase function. LED irradiation at 426 nm alone, without the photocatalyst, contributed to 10% of the observed inactivation and was attributed to production of reactive oxygen species due to blue-light photoexcitation of molecules in the culture media, which opens further modes of action to engineer disinfection strategies. The visible light active B-BiOBr photocatalyst, with its rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence and absence of light, holds tremendous opportunities to build a healthy environment by preventing the fecal-oral and fomite transmission of emerging pathogens.",Li Ling; Tea Carletti; Zihang Cheng; Ruixuan Wang; Yanxiao Ren; Paul Westerhoff; Chii Shang; Alessandro Marcello; Shuyu Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434359,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434359,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
232,A recombinant ACE2 Triple Decoy that traps and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 shows enhanced affinity for highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants,"The highly-transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants now replacing the first wave strain pose an increased threat to human health by their ability, in some instances, to escape existing humoral protection conferred by previous infection, neutralizing antibodies, and possibly vaccination. Thus, other therapeutic options are necessary. One such therapeutic option that leverages SARS-CoV-2 initiation of infection by binding of its spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) to surface-expressed host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE2  decoy that would trap the virus by competitive binding and thus inhibit propagation of infection. Here, we used Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to predict ACE2 mutations that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened these candidates for binding affinity in vitro. A double mutant ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein was found to have very high affinity for S RBD and to show greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay as compared to wild type ACE2. We further modified the double mutant ACE2 decoy by addition of an H374N mutation to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity while maintaining high S RBD affinity. We then confirmed the potential efficacy of our ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC Triple Decoy against S RBD expressing variant-associated E484K, K417N, N501Y, and L452R mutations and found that our ACE2 Triple Decoy not only maintains its high affinity for S RBD expressing these mutations, but shows enhanced affinity for S RBD expressing the N501Y or L452R mutations and the highest affinity for S RBD expressing both the E484K and N501Y mutations. The ACE2 Triple Decoy also demonstrates the ability to compete with wild type ACE2 in the cPass surrogate virus neutralization in the presence of S RBD with these mutations. Additional MD simulation of ACE2 WT and decoy interactions with S RBD WT or B.1.351 variant sequence S RBD provides insight into the enhanced affinity of the ACE2 decoy for S RBD and reveals its potential as a tool to predict affinity and inform therapeutic design. The ACE2 Triple Decoy is now undergoing continued assessment, including expression by a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) construct to facilitate delivery in vivo.

Summary sentenceAn ACE2(N27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC fusion protein decoy sustains high affinity to all SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein variants tested, shows enhanced affinity for the N501Y and L452R variants, and the highest affinity for combined N501Y and E484K variants.",Shiho Tanaka; Gard Nelson; Anders Olson; Oleksandr Buzko; Wendy Higashide; Annie Shin; Marcos Gonzales; Justin Taft; Roosheel Sandeep Patel; Sofija Buta; Marta Martin-Fernandez; Dusan Sandeep Bogunovic; Patricia R Spilman; Kayvan Niazi; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Patrick Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434641,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.434641,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
233,COVIDrugNet: a network-based web tool to investigate the drugs currently in clinical trial to contrast COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge problem of public health that requires the implementation of all available means to contrast it, and drugs are one of them. In this context, we observed an unmet need of depicting the continuously evolving scenario of the ongoing drug clinical trials through an easy-to-use, freely accessible online tool. Starting from this consideration, we developed COVIDrugNet (http://compmedchem.unibo.it/covidrugnet), a web application that allows users to capture a holistic view and keep up to date on how the clinical drug research is responding to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we describe the web app and show through some examples how one can explore the whole landscape of medicines in clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 and try to probe the consistency of the current approaches with the available biological and pharmacological evidence. We conclude that careful analyses of the COVID-19 drug-target system based on COVIDrugNet can help to understand the biological implications of the proposed drug options, and eventually improve the search for more effective therapies.",Luca Menestrina; Chiara Cabrelle; Maurizio Recanatini,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.433897,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.433897,2021-03-09,2021-03-09,,False
234,The FDA-approved drug cobicistat synergizes with remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication,"Combinations of direct-acting antivirals are needed to minimize drug-resistance mutations and stably suppress replication of RNA viruses. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and testing of a number of drug regimens has led to conflicting results. Here we show that cobicistat, which is an-FDA approved drug-booster that blocks the activity of the drug metabolizing proteins Cytochrome P450-3As (CYP3As) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Cell-to-cell membrane fusion assays indicated that the antiviral effect of cobicistat is exerted through inhibition of spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. In line with this, incubation with low micromolar concentrations of cobicistat decreased viral replication in three different cell lines including cells of lung and gut origin. When cobicistat was used in combination with the putative CYP3A target and nucleoside analog remdesivir, a synergistic effect on the inhibition of viral replication was observed in cell lines and in a primary human colon organoid. The cobicistat/remdesivir combination was able to potently abate viral replication to levels comparable to mock-infected cells leading to an almost complete rescue of infected cell viability. These data highlight cobicistat as a therapeutic candidate for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a potential building block of combination therapies for COVID-19.",Iart Luca Shytaj; Mohamed Fares; Bojana Lucic; Lara Gallucci; Mahmoud M.

235,Site-specific steric control of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycosylation,"A central tenet in the design of vaccines is the display of native-like antigens in the elicitation of protective immunity. The abundance of N-linked glycans across the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a potential source of heterogeneity between the many different vaccine candidates under investigation. Here, we investigate the glycosylation of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins from five different laboratories and compare them against infectious virus S protein. We find patterns which are conserved across all samples and this can be associated with site-specific stalling of glycan maturation which act as a highly sensitive reporter of protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a fully glycosylated spike support s a model of steric restrictions that shape enzymatic processing of the glycans.

236,Post discharge persistent symptoms after COVID-19 in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases,"OBJECTIVESTo describe persistent symptoms and consequences in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) discharged from the hospital after Covid-19; to assess the roll of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) compared to and non-autoimmune rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (NARD) on persistent symptoms and consequences.

METHODSWe performed a cross-sectional observational study. RMD attended at a rheumatology outpatient clinic in Madrid with Covid-19 that required hospital admission were included. The main outcomes were persistence of symptoms and health consequences related to Covid19 after discharge. Independent variable was RMD group (ARD and NARD) and covariates were sociodemographic, clinical, and treatments. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the risk by RMD group on main outcomes.

RESULTSWe included 105 patients and 51.5% had ARD. 68.57% reported at least one persistent symptom. The most frequent were dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. 31 patients had consequences. Lung damage was found in 11.4% of the patients, 18% had blood test abnormalities (10% lymphopenia), two died, one developed central retinal vein occlusion and one patient developed optic neuritis. 11 patients required readmission due to Covid-19 problems (16.7% ARD vs 3.9% NARD; p=0.053). No statistically significant differences by RMD groups were found in the final models.

CONCLUSIONMany RMD patients have persistent symptoms, similar to other populations. This study also highlights that lung damage is the most frequent consequence.

237,COVID-19 vaccine response in pregnant and lactating women: a cohort study,"BackgroundPregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial COVID-19 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision-making are lacking. We sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women.

Methods131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131), umbilical cord sera (N=10), and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, 2nd vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post 2nd vaccine, and delivery by Luminex, and confirmed by ELISA. Titers were compared to pregnant women 4-12 weeks from native infection (N=37). Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups.

ResultsVaccine-induced immune responses were equivalent in pregnant and lactating vs non-pregnant women. All titers were higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, but not IgA, increased in maternal blood and breastmilk with vaccine boost. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection.

238,Exploration of interethnic variation and repurposed drug efficacy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19),"The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to repurposing of drugs, with little underlying evidence for treatment safety and efficacy. This may increase complications for patients with acute viral respiratory infections. UGT1A1 and CYP2D6 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of atazanavir and fluvoxamine repurposed for COVID-19. This study aimed to elucidate the role of interethnic variation in these enzymes in the efficacy of repurposed drug therapies. A retrospective cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. Comprehensive global population genetic structure analyses were performed for CYP2D6 and UGT1A1 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations of over 131,000 global subjects from 417 published reports, revealing that Jordanian Arabs share the closest sequence homology to European and Near East populations. The East Asian populations have significantly over-representaiton of individuals with diplotype pairs for reduced atazanavir metabolism compared to the African populations and are more likely to show impaired UGT1A1 metabolism. East Asian populations are also 4.4x more likely to show impaired fluvoxamine metabolism than South Central Asian and Oceanian populations, and 8x more likely than other ancestry populations. The results here support previous findings that interethnic variation should be used for developing proper population-specific dosage guidelines.",Ammar Ali Almarzooq,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21253095,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21253095,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
239,"SARS-CoV-2 infects blood monocytes to activate NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, pyroptosis and cytokine release","SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress that can progress to multiorgan failure and death in some patients. Although severe COVID-19 disease is linked to exuberant inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not understood. Monocytes are sentinel blood cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and processing and release of IL-1 family cytokines, potent inflammatory mediators. Here we show that ~10% of blood monocytes in COVID-19 patients are dying and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection, which depends on antiviral antibodies, activates NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and GSDMD cleavage and relocalization. Signs of pyroptosis (IL-1 family cytokines, LDH) in the plasma correlate with development of severe disease. Moreover, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) linked to higher GSDMD expression increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio, 1.3, p<0.005). These findings taken together suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of monocytes triggers inflammation that contributes to severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis.

240,A 1 to 1000 SARS-CoV-2 reinfection proportion in members of a large healthcare provider in Israel: a preliminary report,"With more than 100 million confirmed COVID-19 cases as of March 2021, reinfection is still considered to be rare. In light of increasing reports of reinfected COVID-19 patients, the need to better understand the real risk for reinfection is critical, with potential effects on public health policies aimed at containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this descriptive preliminary report, we conducted a large-scale assessment on the country level of the possible occurrence of COVID-19 reinfection within the members of a large healthcare provider in Israel. Out of 149,735 individuals with a documented positive PCR test between March 2020 and January 2021, 154 had two positive PCR tests at least 100 days apart, reflecting a reinfection proportion of 1 per 1000.

241,Persistence of symptoms up to 10 months following acute COVID-19 illness,"ImportanceCOVID-19 symptoms are increasingly recognized to persist among a subset of individual following acute infection, but features associated with this persistence are not well-understood.

ObjectiveWe aimed to identify individual features that predicted persistence of symptoms over at least 2 months at the time of survey completion.

Design: Non-probability internet survey. Participants were asked to identify features of acute illness as well as persistence of symptoms at time of study completion. We used logistic regression models to examine association between sociodemographic and clinical features and persistence of symptoms at or beyond 2 months.

SettingTen waves of a fifty-state survey between June 13, 2020 and January 13, 2021.

Participants6,211 individuals who reported symptomatic COVID-19 illness confirmed by positive test or clinician diagnosis.

Exposuresymptomatic COVID-19 illness

ResultsAmong 6,211 survey respondents reporting COVID-19 illness, with a mean age of 37.8 (SD 12.2) years and 45.1% female, 73.9% white, 10.0% Black, 9.9% Hispanic, and 3.1% Asian, a total of 4946 (79.6%) had recovered within less than 2 months, while 491 (7.9%) experienced symptoms for 2 months or more. Of the full cohort, 3.4% were symptomatic for 4 months or more and 2.2% for 6 months or more. In univariate analyses, individuals with persistent symptoms on average reported greater initial severity. In logistic regression models, older age was associated with greater risk of persistence (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19 for each decade beyond 40); otherwise, no significant associations with persistence were identified for gender, race/ethnicity, or income. Presence of headache was significantly associated with greater likelihood of persistence (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11-1.86), while fever was associated with diminished likelihood of persistence (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.83).

Conclusion and RelevanceA subset of individuals experience persistent symptoms from 2 to more than 10 months after acute COVID-19 illness, particularly those who recall headache and absence of fever. In light of this prevalence, strategies for predicting and managing such sequelae are needed.

242,"Knowledge, Attitude and Practices towards COVID-19 Guidelines among Students in Bangladesh","This paper explores the level of knowledge, attitude and practices of COVID-19 guidelines among the students in Bangladesh. In achieving this objective, this paper uses primary data collected from 1822 students and three different Likert scales and a one-way ANOVA test are used to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) scores and mean differences with respect to different variables. The research reveals that the majority of students have a higher level of knowledge and a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 guidelines. In contrary, only 0.22 percent students show strong compliance towards COVID-19 guidelines while majority students (60.54 percent) have rather a poor adherence which is an alarming finding. Reopening the educational institutions in Bangladesh is, therefore, not advisable yet and reinforcing the preventive measures through campaigns and online discussion to persuade people to follow the preventive guidelines is highly recommended to contain this global disease.

243,Development and pre-clinical evaluation of Newcastle disease virus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 intranasal vaccine candidate,"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of millions of people worldwide and threatens to become an endemic problem, therefore the need for as many types of vaccines as possible is of high importance.

Because of the millions of doses required, it is desirable that vaccines are not only safe and effective, but also easy to administer, store, and inexpensive to produce.

Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is responsible for a respiratory disease in chickens. It has no pathogenic homologue in humans. NDV is recognized as an oncolytic virus, and its use in humans for oncological treatment is being evaluated.

In the present work, we have developed two types of NDV-vectored candidate vaccines, which carry the surface-exposed RBD and S1 antigens of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. These vaccine candidates were produced in specific-pathogen-free embryonating chicken eggs, and purified from allantoic fluid before lyophilization. These vaccines were administered intranasally to three different animal models: mice, rats and hamsters, and evaluated for safety, toxicity, immunogenicity, stability and efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated in a challenge assay against active SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Golden Syrian hamster model.

The NDV-vectored vaccine based on the S1 antigen was shown to be safe and highly immunogenic, with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro, even with an extreme dilution of 1/640. Our results reveal that this vaccine candidate protects the lungs of the animals, preventing cellular damage in this tissue. In addition, this vaccine reduces the viral load in the lungs, suggesting that it may significantly reduce the likelihood of transmission. Being lyophilized, this vaccine candidate is very stable and can be stored for several months at 4-8C.

In conclusion, our NDV-based vaccine candidate has shown a very favorable performance in the pre-clinical study, serving as evidence for a future evaluation in a Phase-I human clinical trial. This candidate represents a promising tool in the fight against COVID-19.",Manolo Fernandez-Diaz; Katherine Calderon; Aldo Rojas-Neyra; Vikram N.

244,"Development of potency, breadth and resilience to viral escape mutations in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies","Antibodies elicited in response to infection undergo somatic mutation in germinal centers that can result in higher affinity for the cognate antigen. To determine the effects of somatic mutation on the properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, we analyzed six independent antibody lineages. As well as increased neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed pathways for acquisition of resistance and, in some cases, restricted the range of neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation apparently imposed a requirement for multiple spike mutations to enable escape. For certain antibody lineages, maturation enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD. These findings suggest that increasing antibody diversity through prolonged or repeated antigen exposure may improve protection against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 populations, and perhaps against other pandemic threat coronaviruses.",Frauke Muecksch; Yiska Weisblum; Christopher Barnes; Fabian Schmidt; Dennis Schaefer-Babajew; Julio Lorenzi; Andrew Flyak; Andrew DeLaitsch; Kathryn Huey-Tubman; Shurong Hou; Celia Schiffer; Christian Gaebler; Zijun Wang; Justin Da Silva; Daniel Poston; Shlomo Finkin; Alice Cho; Melissa Cipolla; Thiago Oliveira; Katrina Millard; Victor Ramos; Anna Gazumyan; Magdalena Rutkowska; Marina Caskey; Michel Nussenzweig; Pamela Bjorkman; Theodora Hatziioannou; Paul Bieniasz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434227,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434227,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False

246,"Drug development of an affinity enhanced, broadly neutralizing heavy chain only antibody that restricts SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters","We have identified camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs) that cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 and -2, such as VHH72, which binds to a unique highly conserved epitope in the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is difficult to access for human antibodies. Here, we establish a protein engineering path for how a stable, long-acting drug candidate can be generated out of such a VHH building block. When fused to human IgG1-Fc, the prototype VHH72 molecule prophylactically protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we demonstrate that both systemic and intranasal application protects hACE-2-transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 induced lethal disease progression. To boost potency of the lead, we used structure-guided molecular modeling combined with rapid yeast-based Fc-fusion prototyping, resulting in the affinity-matured VHH72_S56A-Fc, with subnanomolar SARS-CoV-1 and -2 neutralizing potency. Upon humanization, VHH72_S56A was fused to a human IgG1 Fc with optimized manufacturing homogeneity and silenced effector functions for enhanced safety, and its stability as well as lack of off-target binding was extensively characterized. Therapeutic systemic administration of a low dose of VHH72_S56A-Fc antibodies strongly restricted replication of both original and D614G mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hamsters, and minimized the development of lung damage. This work led to the selection of XVR011 for clinical development, a highly stable anti-COVID-19 biologic with excellent manufacturability. Additionally, we show that XVR011 is unaffected in its neutralizing capacity of currently rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants, and demonstrate its unique, wide scope of binding across the Sarbecovirus clades.",Bert Schepens; Loes van Schie; Wim Nerinckx; Kenny Roose; Wander Van Breedam; Daria Fijalkowska; Simon Devos; Wannes Weyts; Sieglinde De Cae; Sandrine Vanmarcke; Chiara Lonigro; Hannah Eeckhaut; Dries Van Herpe; Jimmy Borloo; Ana Filipa Oliveira; Joao Portela Catani; Sarah Creytens; Dorien De Vlieger; Gitte Michielsen; Jackeline Cecilia Zavala Marchan; Georgios D.

247,Pediatric nasal epithelial cells are less permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication compared to adult cells,"RationaleYoung children (typically those <10 years old) are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms compared to adults. However, the mechanisms that underlie these age-dependent differences remain to be determined and could inform future therapeutics for adults.

ObjectiveTo contrast the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in primary nasal epithelial cells from adults and children.

MethodsViral replication was quantified by plaque assay. The cellular transcriptome of infected and uninfected cells was assessed by RNA-seq. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression were quantified by Western Blot.

Measurements and Main ResultsWe report significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 replication in adult compared to pediatric nasal epithelial cells. This was restricted to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the same phenomenon was not observed with influenza virus infection. The differentiational SARS-CoV-2 replication dynamics were associated with an elevated type I and III interferon response, and a more pronounced inflammatory response in pediatric cells. No significant difference between the two age groups was observed in the protein levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

ConclusionsOur data suggest that the innate immune response of pediatric nasal epithelial cells, and not differential receptor expression, may contribute to the reported reduced SARS-COV-2 infection and symptoms reported amongst children.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSThere is now a growing body of evidence that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults and if infected, children are more likely to develop an asymptomatic infection. The reasons for this remain unclear. In particular, the role of the pediatric nasal epithelium, the primary point of viral entry into the human host, in this differential susceptibility has yet to be investigated.

What This Study Adds to the FieldOur study indicates that pediatric nasal epithelial cells produce a more vigorous anti-viral and pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to adult cells. This is associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza virus, replication in pediatric epithelial cells. We also show that on a protein level SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression on nasal epithelial cells is not significantly different between children and adults.

249,A comparative recombination analysis of human coronaviruses and implications for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic prompts evaluation of recombination in human coronavirus (hCoV) evolution. We undertook recombination analyses of 158,118 public seasonal hCoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genome sequences using the RDP4 software. We found moderate evidence for 8 SARS-CoV-2 recombination events, two of which involved the spike gene, and low evidence for one SARS-CoV-1 recombination event. Within MERS-CoV, 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 datasets, we noted 7, 1, 9, 14, and 1 high-confidence recombination events, respectively. There was propensity for recombination breakpoints in structural genes, and recombination severely skewed the temporal structure of these data, especially for NL63 and OC43. Bayesian time-scaled analyses on recombinant-free data indicated the sampled diversity of seasonal CoVs emerged in the last 70 years, with 229E displaying continuous lineage replacements. These findings emphasize the importance of genomic based surveillance to detect recombination in SARS-CoV-2, particularly if recombination may lead to immune evasion.",Simon Pollett; Matthew A Conte; Mark A Sanborn; Richard G Jarman; Grace M Lidl; Kayvon Modjarrad; Irina Maljkovic Berry,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434287,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.434287,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
250,Human nasal and lung tissues infected ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2 provide insights into differential tissue-specific and virus-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract,"The nasal-mucosa constitutes the primary entry site for respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here we employed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local-mucosal innate immune response in the authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with rapid increase in tissue-associated viral sub-genomic mRNA, and secretion of infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation of interferon stimulated genes, cytokines and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract, that are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. The studies shed light on the role of the nasal-mucosa in active viral transmission and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19.

IMPORTANCEIn order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tract. Here we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural multicellular complexity of human nasal-mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal-mucosal infection model can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes, and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory pathogens.",Or Alfi; Arkadi Yakirevich; Ori Wald; Ori Wandel; Uzi Izhar; Esther Oiknine-Djian; Yuval Nevo; Sharona Elgavish; Elad Dagan; Ory Madgar; Gilad Feinmesser; Eli Pikarsky; Michal Bronstein; Olesya Vorontsov; Wayne Jonas; John Ives; Joan Walter; Zichria Zakay-Rones; Menachem Oberbaum; Amos Panet; Dana G Wolf,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434404,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434404,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
251,SARS-CoV-2 evolution in animals suggests mechanisms for rapid variant selection,"SARS-CoV-2 spillback from humans into domestic and wild animals has been well-documented. We compared variants of cell culture-expanded SARS-CoV-2 inoculum and virus recovered from four species following experimental exposure. Five nonsynonymous changes in nsp12, S, N and M genes were near fixation in the inoculum, but reverted to wild-type sequences in RNA recovered from dogs, cats and hamsters within 1-3 days post-exposure. Fourteen emergent variants were detected in viruses recovered from animals, including substitutions at spike positions H69, N501, and D614, which also vary in human lineages of concern. The rapidity of in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 selection reveals residues with functional significance during host-switching, illustrating the potential for spillback reservoir hosts to accelerate evolution, and demonstrating plasticity of viral adaptation in animal models.

252,Sialic acid-Dependent Binding and Viral Entry of SARS-CoV-2,"Emerging evidence suggests that host glycans influence infection by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we reveal that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S)-protein on SARS-CoV-2 recognizes oligosaccharides containing sialic acid (SA), with preference for the oligosaccharide of monosialylated gangliosides. Gangliosides embedded within an artificial membrane also bind the RBD. The monomeric affinities (Kd = 100-200 M) of gangliosides for the RBD are similar to heparan sulfate, another negatively charged glycan ligand of the RBD proposed as a viral coreceptor. RBD binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus to ACE2-expressing cells is decreased upon depleting cell surface SA level using three approaches: sialyltransferase inhibition, genetic knock-out of SA biosynthesis, or neuraminidase treatment. These effects on RBD binding and pseudotyped viral entry are recapitulated with pharmacological or genetic disruption of glycolipid biosynthesis. Together, these results suggest that sialylated glycans, specifically glycolipids, facilitate viral entry of SARS-CoV-2.",Linh Nguyen; Kelli A McCord; Duong T Bui; Kim A Bouwman; Elena N Kitova; Dhanraj Kumawat; Gour C Daskan; Ilhan Tomris; Ling Han; Pradeep Chopra; Tzu-Jing Yang; Steven D Williows; Todd L Lowary; Lori J West; Shang-Te Danny Hsu; Stephen Mark Tompkins; Gert-Jan Boons; Andrew L Mason; Robert Paul de Vries; Matthew S Macauley; John S Klassen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434228,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434228,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
253,Comparative host interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 and human coronavirus homologs,"Human coronaviruses have become an increasing threat to global health; three highly pathogenic strains have emerged since the early 2000s, including most recently SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) dataset for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance nuclear protein important for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.",Katherine M Almasy; Jonathan P Davies; Lars Plate,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434440,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.434440,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
254,Comparative studies of the seven human coronavirus envelope proteins using topology prediction and molecular modelling to understand their pathogenicity,"Human (h) coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are less virulent and cause mild, self-limiting respiratory tract infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are more virulent and have caused severe outbreaks. The CoV envelope (E) protein, an important contributor to the pathogenesis of severe hCoVs infections, may provide insight into this disparate severity of the disease. Topology prediction programs and 3D modelling software was used to predict and visualize structural aspects of the hCoV E protein related to its functions. All seven hCoV E proteins largely adopted different topologies, with some distinction between the more virulent and less virulent ones. The 3D models refined this distinction, showing the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 to be more flexible than the PBM of hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. We speculate that the increased flexibility of the PBM may provide the more virulent hCoVs with a greater degree of freedom, which can allow them to bind to different host proteins and can contribute to a more severe form of the disease.

Whole genome sequencing revealed that the 33 samples with the Ph-B.1.1.28 emergent variant merit further investigation as they all contain the E484K, N501Y, and P681H Spike mutations previously found in other variants of concern such as the South African B.1.351, the Brazil P.1 and the UK B.1.1.7 variants. This is the first known report of these mutations co-occurring in the same virus. The possible implications of the mutations found in the Spike protein were analyzed for their potential effects on structure, stability, and molecular surface character. The analysis suggests that these mutations could significantly impact the possible interactions of the Spike protein monomer with the ACE2 receptor and neutralizing antibodies and warrants further clinical investigation. Some of the mutations affecting the N and C terminal domains may have effects on Spike monomer and trimer stability. This report provides insights on relevant targets for the design of future diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines against the evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Philippines.",Neil Andrew David Bascos; Denise Mirano-Bascos; Cynthia Palmes Saloma,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.434059,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.434059,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,False
256,Identification of novel bat coronaviruses sheds light on the evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses,"Although a variety of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses have been identified, the evolutionary origins of this virus remain elusive. We describe a meta-transcriptomic study of 411 samples collected from 23 bat species in a small (~1100 hectare) region in Yunnan province, China, from May 2019 to November 2020. We identified coronavirus contigs in 40 of 100 sequencing libraries, including seven representing SARS-CoV-2-like contigs. From these data we obtained 24 full-length coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2 related and three SARS-CoV related genomes. Of these viruses, RpYN06 exhibited 94.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome and was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in the ORF1ab, ORF7a, ORF8, N, and ORF10 genes. The other three SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses were nearly identical in sequence and clustered closely with a virus previously identified in pangolins from Guangxi, China, although with a genetically distinct spike gene sequence. We also identified 17 alphacoronavirus genomes, including those closely related to swine acute diarrhea syndrome virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23 Rhinolophus bat species in Southeast Asia and southern China, with the largest contiguous hotspots extending from South Lao and Vietnam to southern China. Our study highlights both the remarkable diversity of bat viruses at the local scale and that relatives of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV circulate in wildlife species in a broad geographic region of Southeast Asia and southern China. These data will help guide surveillance efforts to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.",Hong Zhou; Jingkai Ji; Xing Chen; Yuhai Bi; Juan Li; Tao Hu; Hao Song; Yanhua Chen; Mingxue Cui; Yanyan Zhang; Alice C.

257,Genome-Wide Covariation in SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the global pandemic is a coronavirus with a genome of about 30Kbase length [Song et al., 2019]. The design of vaccines and choice of therapies depends on the structure and mutational stability of encoded proteins in the open reading frames(ORFs) of this genome. In this study, we computed, using Expectation Reflection, the genome-wide covariation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome based on an alignment of {approx} 130000 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences obtained from GISAID[Shu & McCauley, 2017]. We used this covariation to compute the Direct Information between pairs of positions across the whole genome, investigating potentially important relationships within the genome, both within each encoded protein and between encoded proteins. We then computed the covariation within each clade of the virus.

This study explores the unique experiences of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Hong Kong, and how COVID-19 impacted their health and economic wellbeing. Interviews with FDWs (n = 15) and key informants (n = 3) were conducted between May and August 2020. FDWs reported a dual-country experience of the pandemic, where they expressed concerns about local transmission risks as well as worries about their family members in their home country. Changes to their current work situation included how their employers treated them, as well as their employment status. FDWs also cited blind spots in the Hong Kong policy response that also affected their experience of the pandemic, including a lack of support from the Hong Kong government.

260,Self-reported real-world safety and reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines: An international vaccine-recipient survey.,"BackgroundThe safety of COVID-19 vaccines has been demonstrated in selected populations in recent studies, but more data in specific groups is needed to inform vaccine choice and health policy.

ObjectivesAn international, online survey was conducted to compare the safety, tolerability and reactogenicity of available COVID-19 vaccines in different recipient groups.

MethodsThis survey was launched in February 2021, for 11 days. Recipients of a first COVID-19 vaccine dose [&ge;]7 days prior to survey completion were eligible. The incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed.

ResultsSurvey was completed by 2,002 respondents, of whom 26.6% had prior COVID-19 infection (68.8% laboratory confirmed). Prior COVID-19 infection was associated with increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence intervals [1.05-1.11]), fever (2.24 [1.86-2.70]), breathlessness (2.05 [1.28-3.29]), flu-like illness (1.78 [1.51-2.10]), fatigue (1.34 [1.20-1.49]) and local reactions (1.10 [1.06-1.15]). It was also associated with increased risk of severe side effects, leading to hospital care (1.56 [1.14-2.12]).

While mRNA vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of any side effect (1.06 [1.01-1.11]) compared to viral vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p<0.001), mostly local reactions. Importantly, mRNA vaccine-recipients reported considerably lower incidence of systemic reactions (RR<0.6) including anaphylaxis, swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue, and of side effects requiring hospital care (0.42 [0.31-0.58]).

ConclusionFor the first time, our study links prior COVID-19 illness with increased incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mRNA vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects, but more local reactions.

Key messages- People with prior COVID-19 illness appear to experience significantly increased incidence and severity of side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
- In this first head-to-head comparison of the safety and reactogenicity of different types of vaccines, it was demonstrated that mRNA vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects, compared to viral vector vaccines, but more local reactions.

261,Recommendations for COVID-19 Vaccination in People with Rheumatic Disease: Developed by the Singapore Chapter of Rheumatologists,"AimPeople with rheumatic diseases (PRD) remain vulnerable in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD.

MethodsSystematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate (1) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (2) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (3) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology.

ResultsThe consensus comprises two overarching principles and seven recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommended that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.

ConclusionThese recommendations provide guidance for COVID-19 vaccination in PRD.

262,"Measuring the exposure of Black, Asian and other ethnic groups to Covid-infected neighbourhoods in English towns and cities","Drawing on the work of The Doreen Lawrence Review - a report on the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in the UK - this paper develops an index of exposure, measuring which ethnic groups have been most exposed to Covid-19 infected residential neighbourhoods during the first and second waves of the pandemic in England. The index is based on a Bayesian Poisson model with a random intercept in the linear predictor, allowing for extra-Poisson variation at neighbourhood and town/city scales. This permits within-city differences to be decoupled from broader regional trends in the disease. The research finds that members of ethnic minority groups tend to be living in areas with higher infection rates but also that the risk of exposure is distributed unevenly across these groups. Initially, in the first wave, the disease disproportionately affected Black residents. As the pandemic has progressed, especially the Pakistani but also the Bangladeshi and Indian groups have had the highest exposure. This higher exposure of the Pakistani group is not straightforwardly a function of neighbourhood deprivation because it is present across a range of average house prices. However, we find evidence to support the view, expressed in The Doreen Lawrence Review, that it is linked to occupational and environmental exposure, particularly residential density.",Richard Harris; Chris Brunsdon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252893,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252893,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
263,Estimating the super-spreading rate at workplaces using bluetooth technology,"Workplaces deploy internal guidelines to remain operational during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is challenging to assess whether those interventions will prevent super-spreading events, where an infected individual transmits the disease to 10 or more secondary cases. Here we provide a model of infectious disease at the level of a workplace to address that problem. We take as input proximity contact records based on bluetooth technology and the infectious disease parameters from the literature. Using proximity contact data for a case-study workplace and an infection transmission model, we estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate as 0.014 per proximity contact, going up to 0.041 for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the UK. Defining super-spreading as events with 10 or more secondary infections, we obtain a super-spreading event rate of 2.3 per 1000 imported SARS-CoV-2 cases, rising up to 13.7 for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7.

264,Comparison of IgG and neutralizing antibody responses after one or two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in previously infected and uninfected persons,"ObjectiveTo compare anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody concentrations and antibody-mediated neutralization of spike-ACE2 receptor binding in vitro following vaccination of non-hospitalized participants by sero-status and acute virus diagnosis history.

MethodsParticipants were studied before and after mRNA vaccination in a community-based, home-collected, longitudinal serosurvey; none reported hospitalization for COVID-19. Prior to vaccination, some reported prior positive acute viral diagnostic testing and were seropositive (COVID-19+). Participants who did not report acute viral diagnostic testing were categorized as seropositive or seronegative based on anti-spike RBD IgG test results. Primary measures were anti-spike RBD IgG concentration and percent antibody-mediated neutralization of spike protein-ACE2 interaction prior to vaccination, and after one or two doses of vaccine.

ResultsOf 290 unique vaccine recipients, 42 reported a prior COVID-19 diagnosis and were seropositive (COVID-19+). Of the 248 with no history of acute viral diagnostic testing, 105 were seropositive and 143 seronegative before vaccination. The median age was 38yrs (range 21-83) with 65% female and 35% male; 40% were non-white. Responses were evaluated after one (n=140) or two (n=170) doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine. After one dose, median post-vaccine IgG concentration and percent neutralization were each significantly higher among the COVID-19+ group (median 47.7 {micro}g/ml, IgG; >99.9% neutralization) compared to the seropositives (3.4 {micro}g /ml IgG; 62.8% neutralization) and seronegatives (2.2 {micro}g /ml IgG; 39.5% neutralization). The latter two groups reached >95% neutralization after the second vaccine dose.

ConclusionsA prior outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with strong anti-spike RBD IgG and in vitro neutralizing responses after one vaccine dose. Persons seropositive for anti-spike RBD IgG in the absence of acute viral diagnostic testing, and those who were seronegative, required two doses to achieve equivalently high levels of IgG and neutralization activity. One mRNA vaccine dose is not sufficient to generate in vitro evidence of strong protection against COVID-19 among most persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, nor among seronegative persons.",Alexis R.

265,Estimation and optimal control of the multi-scale dynamics of the Covid-19,"This work aims at a better understanding and the optimal control of the spread of the new severe acute respiratory corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We first propose a multi-scale model giving insights on the virus population dynamics, the transmission process and the infection mechanism. We consider 10 compartments in the human population in order to take into accounts the effects of different specific mitigation policies: susceptible, infected, infectious, quarantined, hospitalized, treated, recovered, non-infectious dead, infectious dead, buried. The population of viruses is also partitioned into 10 compartments corresponding respectively to each of the first nine human population compartments and the free viruses available in the environment. Indeed, we have human to human virus transmission, human to environment virus transmission, environment to human virus transmission and self infection by susceptible individuals. We show the global stability of the disease free equilibrium if a given threshold[T] 0 is less or equal to 1 and we provide how to compute the basic reproduction number[R] 0. A convergence index[T] 1 is also defined in order to estimate the speed at which the disease extincts and an upper bound to the time of extinction is given. The existence of the endemic equilibrium is conditional and its description is provided. We evaluate the sensitivity of[R] 0,[T] 0 and[T] 1 to control parameters such as the maximal human density allowed per unit of surface, the rate of disinfection both for people and environment, the mobility probability, the wearing mask probability or efficiency, and the human to human contact rate which results from the previous one. Except the maximal human density allowed per unit of surface, all those parameters have significant effects on the qualitative dynamics of the disease. The most significant is the probability of wearing mask followed by the probability of mobility and the disinfection rate. According to a functional cost taking into consideration economic impacts of SARS-CoV-2, we determine and discuss optimal fighting strategies. The study is applied to real available data from Cameroon and an estimation of model parameters is done. After several simulations, social distancing and the disinfection frequency appear as the main elements of the optimal control strategy.",David Jaures FOTSA MBOGNE; Stephane Yanick TCHOUMI; Yannick Kouakep Tchaptchie; Vivient Corneille KAMLA; Jean Claude KAMGANG; Duplex Elvis HOUPA DANGA; Samuel BOWONG TSAKOU; David BEKOLLE,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252880,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252880,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
266,Bromhexine Hydrochloride Prophylaxis of COVID-19 for Medical Personnel: A Randomized Open-Label Study,"BackgroundBromhexine hydrochloride has been suggested as a TMPRSS2 protease blocker that precludes the penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 into cells. We aimed to assess the preventive potential of regular bromhexine hydrochloride intake for COVID-19 risk reduction in medical staff actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsIn a single-center randomized open-label study medical staff managing patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and followed-up for 8 weeks. The study began at the initiation of COVID-19 management in the clinic. We enrolled 50 participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: 25 were assigned to bromhexine hydrochloride treatment (8 mg 3 times per day), and 25 were controls. The composite primary endpoint was a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to SARS-CoV-2 or the signs of clinical infection within 28 days and at week 8. Secondary endpoints included the symptomatic infection rate and positive nasopharyngeal swab (PCR) tests.

ResultsThe rate of the combined primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the active treatment group (2/25 [8%]) and control group (7/25 [28%]); P = 0.07. A fewer number of participants developed symptomatic infection (confirmed COVID-19) in the treatment group compared to controls (0/25 vs 5/25; P = 0.02).

ConclusionBromhexine hydrochloride prophylaxis was associated with a reduced rate of symptomatic COVID-19. However, the prophylactic treatment was not associated with a lower combined primary endpoint rate, a positive swab PCR test and/or COVID-19.

267,Development and Implementation of a scalable and versatile test for COVID-19 diagnostics in rural communities,"Rapid and widespread testing of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for an effective public health response aimed at containing and mitigating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Successful health policy implementation relies on early identification of infected individuals and extensive contact tracing.However, rural communities, where resources for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive challenges to achieving this success. Accordingly, we report the development of an academic, public land grant University laboratory-based detection assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical specimens that can be readily deployed in areas where access to testing is limited. The test, which is a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples provided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our test exhibits comparable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity values compared to other molecular assays. Additionally, this test can be re-configured to meet supply chain shortages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable to several clinical specimens. Test development also involved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a stable collection media that allowed samples to be transported for hours over a dispersed rural region without the need for a cold-chain. These two elements that were critical when shortages impacted testing and when personnel needed to reach areas that were geographically isolated from the testing center. Overall, using a robust, easy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs and help local health departments assess and manage outbreaks. This additional testing capacity is particularly germane for smaller cities and rural regions that would otherwise be unable to meet the testing demand.",Alessandro Ceci; Carmen Munoz-Ballester; Allison Tegge; Katherine L Brown; Robyn Anne Umans; F.

268,Predictive Capacity of COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate,"COVID-19 infections can spread silently, due to the simultaneous presence of significant numbers of both critical and asymptomatic to mild cases. While for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision makers planning ahead (e.g. medical structures and equipment). Previous work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e. the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospital and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA). The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e. the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead, of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.",Livio Fenga; Mauro Gaspari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252897,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252897,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True

270,A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies comparing mental health before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundIncreases in mental health problems have been observed in some studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether changes have been large and experienced by most population sub-groups, persisted over time or been symptom specific.

MethodsWe systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined changes in mental health among the same group of participants before and during the pandemic (PROSPERO: CRD42021231256). Searches for published and unpublished studies were conducted in January 2021. Changes in mental health (standardised mean change; SMC) were examined using meta-analyses.

FindingsSixty-five studies were included. There was an overall increase in mental health symptoms that was most pronounced during March-April 2020 (SMC = .102 [95% CI: .026 to .192], p = 0.03) before significantly declining over time (May-July SMC = .067 [95% CI: -.022 to .157], p = .141). Compared to measures of anxiety (SMC = 0.13, p = 0.02) and general mental health (SMC = -.03, p = 0.65), increases in depression and mood disorder symptoms tended to be larger (SMC = 0.22, p < .001) and reductions over time appeared less pronounced. Increased mental health symptoms were observed across most population subgroups examined but there was no evidence of any change in symptoms among samples with a pre-existing mental health condition.

InterpretationThere was a small increase in mental health symptoms soon after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that decreased and was comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020 among most population sub-groups and symptom types.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere have been reported increases in mental health problems during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether changes in mental health problems have been symptom specific, how changes have differed across populations and whether increased mental health problems have persisted over time. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined mental health among the same participants prior to and during the pandemic in 2020. This approach allowed us to quantify the mental health burden associated with the outbreak of the pandemic and how it has changed over time. We searched Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and PsychInfo from January 2020 to January 11, 2021 and identified eligible unpublished articles available on pre-print servers.

Added value of this studyWe identified 65 eligible articles that reported 201 comparisons of mental health pre vs. post pandemic outbreak. Meta-analysis indicated that longitudinal cohort studies that examined mental health prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 showed a significant but statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. The overall increase in mental health symptoms was most pronounced during the early stages of the pandemic (March-April), before decreasing and being generally comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020.

Compared to anxiety and general measures of mental health functioning, increases tended to be larger in depressive symptoms and although statistically small, remained elevated past the early stages of the pandemic. Increases in mental health symptoms were observed across most population sub-groups, but there was no evidence of a change in mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health condition.

Implications of all the available evidenceFindings confirm that the initial outbreak of the pandemic was associated with a significant but statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. Given that small effects may have meaningful cumulative consequences at the population level, there is a need for continued mental health provision and monitoring particularly during periods of the pandemic when infection rates and deaths are high. Further into the pandemic, mental health problems decreased significantly, which indicated recovery and resilience in overall mental health. Contrary to predictions made early in the pandemic, there was also no evidence of a worsening of mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health condition. Overall the results of the present analyses suggest that the pandemic may not have caused an unprecedented and long lasting mental health crisis, instead there appears to have been resilience in mental health.",Eric Robinson; Angelina R Sutin; Michael Daly; Andrew Jones,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252921,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252921,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
271,An increase in willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the US between October 2020 and February 2021: longitudinal evidence from the Understanding America Study,"BackgroundRecent evidence suggests that willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 has been declining throughout the pandemic and is low among ethnic minority groups.

MethodsObservational study using a nationally representative longitudinal sample (N =7,840) from the Understanding America Study (UAS). Changes in the percentage of respondents willing to vaccinate, undecided, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine were examined over 20 survey waves from April 1 2020 to February 15 2021.

ResultsAfter a sharp decline in willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 between April and October 2020 (from 74.0% to 52.7%), willingness to vaccinate increased by 8.1% (p <.001) to 60.8% between October 2020 and February 2021. A significant increase in willingness to vaccinate was observed across all demographic groups examined and Black (15.6% increase) and Hispanic participants (12.1% increase) showed particularly large changes.

ConclusionsWillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 increased in the US from October 2020 to February 2021.

272,Analysis of the Factors Affecting the Adoption and Compliance of the NHS COVID-19 Mobile Application,"ObjectivesTo conduct an independent study investigating how adults perceive the usability, and functionality of the ""NHS COVID-19"" app. This study aims to highlight strengths, and provide recommendations to improve adoption of future contact tracing developments.

Design, Setting, and Participants1036 adults in England and Wales completed a 60-item, web-based observational survey. This survey was disseminated through social media outlets and email-lists.

Primary Outcome MeasuresTo evaluate the compliance and public attitude towards the ""NHS COVID-19"" app, regarding its functionality and main features. This included whether participants expectations were met, and their thoughts on the privacy and security of app data. Furthermore, to distinguish how usability, perception, and adoption differed with varying demographics and user values.

ResultsFair rates of app compliance were identified across participants, with the app meeting the expectation of 59.7% of participants who downloaded it. However, participants finding the interface challenging were less likely to read information in the app and had a lesser understanding of its functionality. Furthermore, lack of understanding regarding the apps functionality and privacy preserving features were behind the reasons why users did not download it. A readability analysis of the text revealed that the information of the app was conveyed at a level which might only be accessible to under 60% of the population. The study highlighted issues related to the high probability of false positives caused by the design choices in the ""Check-In"" feature.

ConclusionThis study showed that while the ""NHS COVID-19"" app was viewed positively, however, there remained issues regarding participants perceived knowledge of the app with privacy and functionality, which appeared to affect compliance. Therefore, we have recommended improvements regarding the delivery and presentation of the apps information, and highlighted the potential need for the ability to check out of venues to reduce the number of false positive contacts.

275,A common TMPRSS2 variant protects against severe COVID-19,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has a wide range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Old age is the strongest factor associated with increased COVID19-related mortality, followed by sex and pre-existing conditions. The importance of genetic and immunological factors on COVID19 outcome is also starting to emerge, as demonstrated by population studies and the discovery of damaging variants in genes controlling type I IFN immunity and of autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs. The human protein transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it is required to activate the virus spike protein, facilitating entry into target cells. We focused on the only common TMPRSS2 non-synonymous variant predicted to be damaging (rs12329760), which has a minor allele frequency of [~]25% in the population. In a large population of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, we show that this variant is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing severe COVID19 (OR 0.87, 95%CI:0.79-0.97, p=0.01). This association was stronger in homozygous individuals when compared to the general population (OR 0.65, 95%CI:0.50-0.84, p=1.3x10-3). We demonstrate in vitro that this variant, which causes the amino acid substitution valine to methionine, impacts the catalytic activity of TMPRSS2 and is less able to support SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated entry into cells.

TMPRSS2 rs12329760 is a common variant associated with a significantly decreased risk of severe COVID19. Further studies are needed to assess the expression of the TMPRSS2 across different age groups. Moreover, our results identify TMPRSS2 as a promising drug target, with a potential role for camostat mesilate, a drug approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis, in the treatment of COVID19. Clinical trials are needed to confirm this.","Alessia David; Nicholas Parkinson; Thomas P Peacock; Erola Pairo-Castineira; Tarun Khanna; Aurelie Cobat; Albert Tenesa; Vanessa Sancho-Shimizu; - GenOMICC Investigators, ISARIC4C Investigators; Jean-Laurent Casanova; Laurent Abel; Wendy S Barclay; J Kenneth Baillie; Michael J.E.

276,Impact of remdesivir on 28 day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: February 2021 Meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a myriad of potential therapeutic agents, including antivirals such as remdesivir. The first RCT reporting results on the impact of remdesivir on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the ACTT-1 trial published in November, 2020. The ACTT-1 trial showed more rapid clinical improvement and a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received remdesivir.

This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of remdesivir therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the analysis process.

MethodsMeta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing remdesivir to usual care or placebo. The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered and published in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021229985) on February 5, 2021.

ResultsFour English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7,333 hospitalized patients worldwide using remdesivir in COVID-19 positive patients.

Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who received remdesivir therapy compared to usual care or placebo. The random effects meta-analysis has a summary odd ratio is 0.89 (95% CI 0.65-1.21, p = 0.30). Considerable variability in the severity of illness is noted with the rates of IMV at the time of randomization ranging from 0% to 27%.

ConclusionsThis meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by February 1, 2021 did not show reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received remdesivir.

277,Comparison of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies in the United States,"A critical question in the COVID-19 pandemic is how to optimally allocate the first available vaccinations to maximize health impact. We used a static simulation model with detailed demographic and risk factor stratification to compare the impact of different vaccine prioritization strategies in the United States on key health outcomes, using California as a case example. We calibrated the model to demographic and location data on 28,175 COVID-19 deaths in California up to December 30, 2020, and incorporated variation in risk by occupation and comorbidity status using published estimates. We predicted the proportion of COVID-19 clinical cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted over 6 months relative to a scenario of no vaccination for five vaccination strategies that prioritized vaccination by a single risk factor: random allocation; targeting special populations (e.g. incarcerated individuals); targeting older individuals; targeting essential workers; and targeting individuals with comorbidities. Targeting older individuals averted the highest proportion of DALYs (40% for 5 million individuals vaccinated) and deaths (65%) but the lowest proportion of cases (12%). Targeting essential workers averted the lowest proportion of DALYs (25%) and deaths (33%). Allocating vaccinations simultaneously by age and location or by age, sex, race/ethnicity, location, occupation, and comorbidity status averted a significantly higher proportion of DALYs (48% and 56%) than any strategy prioritizing by a single risk factor. Our results corroborate findings of other studies that age targeting is the best single-risk-factor prioritization strategy for averting DALYs, and suggest that targeting by multiple risk factors would provide additional benefit.

Significance statementCOVID-19 has caused a global pandemic, and a key public health question is who should get the first available vaccinations. Most vaccine prioritization analyses have only considered variation in risk of infection and death by age and occupation. We provide a more granular analysis with stratification by demographics, risk factors, and location. We predict the impact of different prioritization strategies on COVID-19 cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We find that age-based targeting averts the most deaths and DALYs of strategies targeting by a single risk factor, but that targeting by two or more risk factors simultaneously would avert significantly more deaths and DALYs. Our findings highlight the potential value of multiple-risk-factor targeting of vaccination when supply is limited.",Lloyd A. C. Chapman; Poojan Shukla; Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer; Priya B.

278,Factors associated with increased mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a Mexican public hospital: the other faces of health system oversaturation.,"BACKGROUNDThe lethality rate of COVID-19 in Mexico is one of the highest worldwide, but in-hospital factors associated with this increased rate have yet to be explored. This study aims to evaluate those factors that could be associated with mortality at 28-days in critically ill COVID-19 patients in Mexico.

METHODSThis is a retrospective analysis of the patients included in the clinical trial (NCT04381858) which recruited patients with severe COVID-19 with high oxygen requirement or mechanical ventilation from May to October 2020. The primary outcome, death at 28, was analyzed.

RESULTSBetween May and October 2020, 196 predominantly male patients (n=122, 62.2%) with an average of 58.1 years ({+/-} 15.5), were included in the cohort. Mortality at 28 days was 44.3 % (n= 84). Patients included in the second trimester had a greater mortality rate when compared with those recruited in the first trimester (54.1 vs 32.1, p< 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the detected protective factors were the use of fentanyl HR 0.51 (95%CI 0.31 - 0.85, p=0.01), the use of antibiotics HR 0.22 (95% CI 0.13 - 0.36, p<0.01), and a previously healthy state (no comorbidities other than obesity) HR 0.58 (95%CI 0.35 - 0.94, p =0.03); risk factors were severe kidney injury (AKIN3) HR 1.74 (95%CI 1.04 - 2.9, p=0.035), elevated D-Dimer levels HR 1.02 (95%CI 1.007 - 1.04, p=0.005), shock OR 5.8 (2.4 - 13.8, p<0.01), and recruitment in the second trimester OR 2.3 ((1.1 - 4.8, p=0.02).

CONCLUSIONSIn-hospital mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients has increased in our center. The appropriate use of antibiotics, the type of sedation, and AKIN3 are modifiable factors directly related to this increased mortality. The increase in mortality observed in the second trimester is explained by hospital overcrowding that began in August 2020.",Mariana Jocelyn Macias Guzman; Alejandro Castillo Gonzalez; Jose Lenin Beltran Gonzalez; Mario Gonzalez Gamez; Emmanuel Antonio Mendoza Enciso; Itzel Ovalle Robles; Andrea Lucia Garcia Diaz; Cesar Mauricio Gutierrez Pena; Lucila Martinez Medina; Victor Antonio Monroy Colin; Jose Manuel Arreola Guerra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252084,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252084,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
279,Serological reconstruction of COVID-19 epidemics through analysis of antibody kinetics to SARS-CoV-2 proteins,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a complex antibody response that varies by orders of magnitude between individuals and over time. Waning antibody levels lead to reduced sensitivity of serological diagnostic tests over time. This undermines the utility of serological surveillance as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses into its second year. Here we develop a multiplex serological test for measuring antibodies of three isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA) to five SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), Spike subunit 2, Membrane-Envelope fusion) and the Spike proteins of four seasonal coronaviruses. We measure antibody responses in several cohorts of French and Irish hospitalized patients and healthcare workers followed for up to eleven months after symptom onset. The data are analysed with a mathematical model of antibody kinetics to quantify the duration of antibody responses accounting for inter-individual variation. One year after symptoms, we estimate that 36% (95% range: 11%, 94%) of anti-S IgG remains, 31% (9%, 89%) anti-RBD IgG remains, and 7% (1%, 31%) anti-N IgG remains. Antibodies of the IgM isotype waned more rapidly, with 9% (2%, 32%) anti-RBD IgM remaining after one year. Antibodies of the IgA isotype also waned rapidly, with 10% (3%, 38%) anti-RBD IgA remaining after one year. Quantitative measurements of antibody responses were used to train machine learning algorithms for classification of previous infection and estimation of time since infection. The resulting diagnostic test classified previous infections with 99% specificity and 98% (95% confidence interval: 94%, 99%) sensitivity, with no evidence for declining sensitivity over the time scale considered. The diagnostic test also provided accurate classification of time since infection into intervals of 0 - 3 months, 3 - 6 months, and 6 - 12 months. Finally, we present a computational method for serological reconstruction of past SARS-CoV-2 transmission using the data from this test when applied to samples from a single cross-sectional sero-prevalence survey.",Stephane Pelleau; Tom Woudenberg; Jason Rosado; Francoise Donnadieu; Laura Garcia; Thomas Obadia; Soazic Gardais; Yasmine Elgharbawy; Aurelie Velay; Maria Gonzalez; Jacques-Yves Nizou; Nizar Khelil; Konstantinos Zannis; Charlotte Cockram; Sarah Merkling; Annalisa Meola; Solen Kerneis; Benjamin Terrier; Jerome de Seze; Delphine Planas; Olivier Schwartz; Francois Dejardin; Stephane Petres; Cassandre von Platen; Laurence Arowas; Louise Perrin de Facci; Darragh Duffy; Cliona Ni Cheallaigh; Niall Conlon; Liam Townsend; Heidi Auerswald; Marija Backovic; Bruno Hoen; Arnaud Fontanet; Ivo Mueller; Samira Fafi-Kremer; Timothee Bruel; Michael T White,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252532,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252532,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
280,Comparative analysis of policies and programs to support families and children during COVID-19,"BackgroundPolicies and programs that promote positive social environments for young children and their families have the potential to improve early childhood development and long-term health. However, due to the community-wide public health measures implemented to reduce transmission of COVID-19, many families are experiencing health and socio-economic challenges and pre-existing supports and services may no longer be available. In this study, we compared the policies and programs countries have implemented to support maternal and child health during the first wave of COVID-19.

MethodsWe compared the policies and programs implemented to support child health and well-being during the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. A grey literature review was performed to identify policies, announcements, and guidelines released from governmental and public health organizations within each country related to children, parents, families, early childhood development, adverse childhood experiences, child welfare, pre-school, or daycares. We also performed a manual search of government websites. Both provincial and federal government policies were included for Canada.

ResultsThe main policies identified were focused on prenatal care, well-baby visit and immunization schedules, financial supports, domestic violence and housing, childcare supports, child protective services, and food security. All of the included countries implemented some of these policies, but there was a large variation in the number, size, and barriers to access these supports. None of the countries implemented supports in all of the potential areas identified.

ConclusionPolitical legacy and previous redistributive policies might have influenced the variation in policies and programs introduced by governments.

281,Diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of clinical symptoms for the diagnosis of mild COVID 19,"ObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinical symptoms and their predictive values in patients with suspected mild COVID-19 and to identify target groups for self-isolation and outpatient treatment without additional testing in the primary health care system.

MethodsWe conducted an open-label prospective study in both male and female patients aged 18 to 72 years with suspected mild COVID-19 who were sequentially enrolled in the study. The clinical diagnosis was performed in accordance with the WHO recommendations based on the acute onset of such symptoms as olfactory dysfunction, hyperthermia, myalgia, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, cough, rhinolalia, sore throat, without pneumonia or hypoxia in persons in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. The physician assessed clinical symptoms using a 4-point scale. The patient self-assessed clinical symptoms using a ten-point visual analogue scale (VAS). All enrolled patients underwent laboratory testing to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19.

ResultsOf the 120 patients underwent testing, the diagnosis of mild COVID-19 was confirmed in 96 patients and ruled out in 24 patients. When assessing symptoms by a physician according to the correlation analysis, hyperthermia, myalgia, nasal congestion and rhinolalia have a positive predictive value with a significance level of more than 0.6. When self-assessing symptoms by a patient, fever, myalgia and nasal congestion have a diagnostic accuracy with a significance level of more than 0.5. Nasal discharge, cough and sore throat have negative predictive values.

DiscussionThe presence of these symptoms in patients with an acute onset of the disease can help to make a clinical diagnosis of coronavirus disease and identify target groups for self-isolation and outpatient treatment without additional testing. Highly suspect asymptomatic patients are not considered as those who have possible mild COVID-19 infection.

282,Endotracheal application of ultraviolet A light in critically ill severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 patients: A first-in-human study,"BackgroundPromising preclinical experiments show that, under specific and monitored conditions, ultraviolet-A (UVA) exposure reduces certain bacteria, fungi, and viruses including coronavirus-229E without harming mammalian columnar epithelial cells. We aimed to evaluate the safety and effects of UVA therapy administered by a novel device via endotracheal tube in critically ill subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsFive newly intubated mechanically ventilated adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an endotracheal tube size 7.5mm or greater, were treated with UVA for 20 minutes daily for 5 days, and followed for 30 days.

ResultsFive subjects were enrolled (mean age 56.6yrs, 3 male). At baseline, all subjects scored 9/10 on the WHO clinical severity scale (10=death) with predicted mortality ranging from 21 to 95%. Average log changes in endotracheal viral load from baseline to day 5 and day 6 were -2.41 (range -1.16 to -4.54; Friedman P=0.002) and -3.20 (range -1.20 to -6.77; Friedman P<0.001), respectively. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events. One subject died 17 days after enrollment due to intracranial hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulation while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining subjects clinically improved and scored 2, 4, 5, and 7 on the WHO scale at day 30. In these subjects, the slope of viral load reduction during UVA treatment correlated with the slope of improvement in clinical WHO severity score over time (Spearman rho=1, P<0.001).

ConclusionIn this first-in-human study, endotracheal UVA therapy under specific and monitored settings, was safe with a significant reduction in respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral burden over the treatment period.

283,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 induces fibrin(ogen) resistant to fibrinolysis: Implications for microclot formation in COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by unprecedented clinical pathologies. One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to {beta} and {gamma} fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. This observation may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients.",Lize M Grobbelaar; Chantelle Venter; Mare Vlok; Malebogo Ngoepe; Gert J Laubscher; Petrus J Lourens; Janami Steenkamp; Douglas B Kell; Etheresia Pretorius; Douglas B Kell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252960,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252960,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True

HP and mortality were compared between different treatment groups to evaluate efficacy of each drug. HP and mortality were also calculated for patients in each treatment group based on their underlying diseases and age. we suggest that using IFN-{beta}1a, RDV and corticosteroids might not have a significant effect on the HP or mortality of the Covid-19 patients as it was thought before.",Sahand Tehrani Fateh; Sepand Tehrani Fateh; Esmaeil Salehi; Nima Rezai; Nazanin Haririan; Abdollah Asgari; Amir Salehi-Najafabadi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21251351,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21251351,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
285,"Covid-19 in the California State Prison System: An Observational Study of Decarceration, Ongoing Risks, and Risk Factors","BackgroundCorrectional institutions nationwide are seeking to mitigate Covid-19-related risks.

ObjectiveTo quantify changes to Californias prison population since the pandemic began and identify risk factors for Covid-19 infection.

DesignWe described residents demographic characteristics, health status, Covid-19 risk scores, room occupancy, and labor participation. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between rates of Covid-19 infection and room occupancy and out-of-room labor, respectively.

SettingCalifornia state prisons (March 1-October 10, 2020).

ParticipantsResidents of California state prisons.

MeasurementsChanges in the incarcerated populations size, composition, housing, and activities. For the risk factor analysis, the exposure variables were room type (cells vs dormitories) and labor participation (any room occupant participating in the prior 2 weeks) and the outcome variable was incident Covid-19 case rates.

ResultsThe incarcerated population decreased 19.1% (119,401 to 96,623) during the study period.On October 10, 2020, 11.5% of residents were aged [&ge;]60, 18.3% had high Covid-19 risk scores, 31.0% participated in out-of-room labor, and 14.8% lived in rooms with [&ge;]10 occupants. Nearly 40% of residents with high Covid-19 risk scores lived in dormitories. In 9 prisons with major outbreaks (6,928 rooms; 21,750 residents), dormitory residents had higher infection rates than cell residents (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51 95%CI, 2.25-2.80) and residents of rooms with labor participation had higher rates than residents of other rooms (AHR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.39-1.74).

LimitationsInability to measure density of residents living conditions or contact networks among residents and staff.

ConclusionDespite reductions in room occupancy and mixing, California prisons still house many medically vulnerable residents in risky settings. Reducing risks further requires a combination of strategies, including rehousing, decarceration, and vaccination.

We conducted direct ex vivo assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescents up to 254 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Here, we report that memory T cell responses were maintained during the study period. In particular, we observed sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells detected by activation-induced markers, the proportion of stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells increased, peaking at approximately 120 DPSO. Development of TSCM cells was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer staining. Considering the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of TSCM cells, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are long-lasting after recovery from COVID-19.

289,"High seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a vulnerable population in Perpignan, France","BackgroundIn March 2020, many cases of COVID-19 were reported in three socially deprived neighbourhoods of the city of Perpignan, in the south of France, where large sedentary gypsy communities live. A study to measure seroprevalence was conducted in July 2020 to assess the level of contamination in these neighbourhoods after the first wave of the pandemic, and to identify factors associated with seropositivity.

MethodsSCoPe is a cross-sectional survey conducted in selected persons aged six years old and over living in three neighbourhoods in Perpignan. Households were selected by systematic sampling and participants by random sampling. Collected blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies using the EIecsys(R) immunoassay to target the coronaviruss spike protein. Antibody seroprevalence was estimated from weighted data and associated factors were investigated using multivariate logistic regression.

ResultsThe seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 35.4% (95% CI: 30.2-41.0). Over a fifth of seropositive individuals (21.7% ([14.1-31.8]) did not report any COVID-19 symptom. People aged 15-64 years old were at greater risk of seropositivity than those aged 65 years or over. Obesity prevalence was 40.7% (35.8-45.8) and obese people were more likely to be seropositive (aOR=2.0 [1.1-3.8]). The risk of being seropositive was higher in households with clinical COVID-19 cases (One case: aOR=2.5 [1.3-5.0]). In the neighbourhood with the highest measured seroprevalence, people living in a dwelling with 1-2 rooms had a higher risk of being seropositive than those living in a 4-room house (aOR=2.8 [1.2-6.3]). Working during the lockdown was associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (aOR=0.2 [0.03-1.0]).

290,"Serological surveys to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults (Sero-MAss study), Massachusetts, July-August 2020","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis. The state of Massachusetts was especially impacted during the initial stages; however, the extent of asymptomatic transmission remains poorly understood due to limited asymptomatic testing in the ""first wave."" To address this gap, a geographically representative and contact-free seroprevalence survey was conducted in July-August 2020, to estimate prior undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections.

MethodsStudents, faculty, librarians and staff members at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were invited to participate in this study along with one member of their household in June 2020. Two separate sampling frames were generated from administrative lists: all undergraduates and their household members (primary sampling group) were randomly selected with probability proportional to population size. All staff, faculty, graduate students and librarians (secondary sampling group) were selected as a simple random sample. After informed consent and a socio-behavioral survey, participants were mailed test kits and asked to return self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, and then IgM antibodies if IgG-positive. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for survey non-response. Binomial models were used to assess factors associated with seropositivity in both sample groups separately.

ResultsApproximately 27,000 persons were invited via email to assess eligibility. Of the 1,001 individuals invited to participate in the study, 762 (76%) returned blood samples for analysis. In the primary sampling group 548 returned samples, of which 230 enrolled a household member. Within the secondary sampling group of 214 individuals, 79 enrolled a household member. In the primary sample group, 36 (4.6%) had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated weighed prevalence for this population of 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5 to 8.0). In the secondary sampling group, 10 (3.4%) of 292 individuals had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated adjusted prevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.4). No samples were IgM positive. No association was found in either sample group between seropositivity and self-reported work duties or customer-facing hours. In the primary sampling group, self-reported febrile illness since Feb 2020, male sex, and minority race (Black or American Indian/Alaskan Native) were associated with seropositivity. No factors except geographic regions within the state were associated with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the secondary sampling group.

InterpretationThis study provides insight into the seroprevalence of university-related populations and their household members across the state of Massachusetts during the summer of 2020 of the pandemic and helps to fill a critical gap in estimating the levels of sub-clinical and asymptomatic infection. Estimates like these can be used to calibrate models that estimate levels of population immunity over time to inform public health interventions and policy.

291,Higher COVID-19 vaccination rates are linked to decreased county-level COVID-19 incidence across USA,"Real world evidence studies of mass vaccination across health systems have reaffirmed the safety1 and efficacy2,3 of the FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. However, the impact of vaccination on community transmission remains to be characterized. Here, we compare the cumulative county-level vaccination rates with the corresponding COVID-19 incidence rates among 87 million individuals from 580 counties in the United States, including 12 million individuals who have received at least one vaccine dose. We find that cumulative county-level vaccination rate through March 1, 2021 is significantly associated with a concomitant decline in COVID-19 incidence (Spearman correlation {rho} = -0.22, p-value = 8.3e-8), with stronger negative correlations in the Midwestern counties ({rho} = -0.37, p-value = 1.3e-7) and Southern counties ({rho} = -0.33, p-value = 4.5e-5) studied. Additionally, all examined US regions demonstrate significant negative correlations between cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate prior to the vaccine rollout and the decline in the COVID-19 incidence rate between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, with the US western region being particularly striking ({rho} = -0.66, p-value = 5.3e-37). However, the cumulative vaccination rate and cumulative incidence rate are noted to be statistically independent variables, emphasizing the need to continue the ongoing vaccination roll out at scale. Given confounders such as different coronavirus restrictions and mask mandates, varying population densities, and distinct levels of diagnostic testing and vaccine availabilities across US counties, we are advancing a public health resource to amplify transparency in vaccine efficacy monitoring (https://public.nferx.com/covid-monitor-lab/vaccinationcheck). Application of this resource highlights outliers like Dimmit county (Texas), where infection rates have increased significantly despite higher vaccination rates, ostensibly owing to amplified travel as a ""vaccination hub""; as well as Henry county (Ohio) which encountered shipping delays leading to postponement of the vaccine clinics.

292,Decisive Conditions for Strategic Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2,"While vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2 are being approved, the number of available doses is limited as it may take months until the production of vaccines can meet the actual demand. The majority of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines elicits strong immune responses when administered as prime-boost regimens. Since the immunological response to the first (""prime"") injection may provide already a substantial reduction in infectiousness and protection against severe disease, it may be more effective--under certain conditions--to vaccinate as many people as possible with only one shot, instead of administering a person a second (""boost"") shot. Such a strategic vaccination campaign may help to more effectively slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce hospitalizations, and reduce fatalities. Yet, the conditions which make single-dose vaccination favorable over prime-boost administrations are not well understood. Here, we formulate a model that helps explore these decisive conditions as a function of the various time scales and epidemiological mechanisms at work. We study how these conditions arise from disease prevalence, vaccination rates, basic reproduction number, prime and prime-boost efficacies, prime-boost intervals, and waning rates. By combining epidemiological modeling, random sampling techniques, and decision tree learning, we find that prime-first vaccination is robustly favored over prime-boost vaccination campaigns, even for high vaccination rates, high disease prevalence, and a relatively low single-dose efficacy.",Lucas Böttcher; Jan Nagler,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252962,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252962,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
293,Adjusting COVID-19 seroprevalence survey results to account for test sensitivity and specificity,"Population-based seroprevalence surveys can provide useful estimates of the number of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still susceptible as well as contribute to better estimates of the case fatality rate and other measures of COVID-19 severity. No serological test is 100% accurate, however, and the standard correction that epidemiologists use to adjust estimates relies on estimates of the test sensitivity and specificity often based on small validation studies. This paper develops a fully Bayesian approach to adjust observed prevalence estimates for sensitivity and specificity. Application to a seroprevalence survey conducted in New York State in 2020 demonstrates that this approach results in more realistic - and narrower - credible interval than the standard sensitivity analysis using confidence interval endpoints. In addition, the model permits incorporating data on the geographical distribution of reported case counts to create informative priors on the cumulative incidence to produce estimates and credible intervals for smaller geographic areas than often can be precisely estimated with seroprevalence surveys.",Mark J Meyer; Shuting Yan; Samantha Schlageter; John D.

294,High-frequency screening combined with diagnostic testing for control of SARS-CoV-2 in high-density settings: an economic evaluation of resources allocation for public health benefit,"SARS-CoV-2 spreads quickly in dense populations, with serious implications for universities, workplaces, and other settings where exposure reduction practices are difficult to implement. Rapid screening has been proposed as a tool to slow the spread of the virus; however, many commonly used diagnostic tests (e.g., RT-qPCR) are expensive, difficult to deploy (e.g., require a nasopharyngeal specimen), and have extended turn-around times. We evaluated testing regimes that combined diagnostic testing using qPCR with high-frequency screening using a novel reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP, herein LAMP) assay. We used a compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to simulate screening of a university population. We also developed a Shiny application to allow administrators and public health professionals to develop optimal testing strategies given site-specific assumptions about testing investment, target population, and cost. The frequency of screening, especially when pooling samples, was more important for minimizing epidemic size than test sensitivity, behavioral compliance, contact tracing capacity, and time between testing and results. Our results suggest that when testing budgets are limited, it is safer and more cost-effective to allocate the majority of funds to screening. Rapid, cost-effective, and scalable screening tests, like LAMP, should be viewed as critical components of SARS-CoV-2 testing in high-density populations.",Will Rogers; Manuel Ruiz-Aravena; Dale Hansen; Wyatt Madden Sonoma; Maureen Kessler; Matthew W Fields; Matthew J Ferrari; Connie B Chang; Jayne Morrow; Andrew Hoegh; Raina K Plowright,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252949,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252949,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
295,Non-uniform UV-C dose across N95 facepieces can cause 2.9-log variation in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation,"During public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, ultraviolet-C (UV-C) decontamination of N95 respirators for emergency reuse has been implemented to mitigate shortages. However, decontamination efficacy across N95s is poorly understood, due to the dependence on received UV-C dose, which varies across the complex three-dimensional N95 shape. Robust quantification of UV-C dose across N95 facepieces presents challenges, as few UV-C measurement tools have sufficient 1) small, flexible form factor, and 2) angular response. To address this gap, we combine optical modeling and quantitative photochromic indicator (PCI) dosimetry with viral inactivation assays to generate high-resolution maps of ""on-N95"" UV-C dose and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 viral inactivation across N95 facepieces within a commercial decontamination chamber. Using modeling to rapidly identify on-N95 locations of interest, in-situ measurements report a 17.4 {+/-} 5.0-fold dose difference across N95 facepieces, yielding 2.9 {+/-} 0.2-log variation in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. UV-C dose at several on-N95 locations was lower than the lowest-dose locations on the chamber floor, highlighting the importance of on-N95 dose validation.

296,A Rapid Method to Evaluate Pre-Travel Testing Programs for COVID-19: A Study in Hawaii,"BackgroundPre-travel testing programs are being implemented around the world to curb COVID-19 and its variants from incoming travelers. A common approach is a single pre-travel test, 72 hours before departure, such as in Hawaii; however this raises concerns for those who are incubating or those infected after pre-travel testing or during transit. We need a rapid method to assess the effectiveness of pre-travel testing programs, and we use Hawaii as our case study.

MethodsWe invited travelers departing from Kahului main airport at the end of their visit to Maui (major tourist destination among the Hawaiian islands) and performed COVID-19 PCR testing. Eligible participants needed a negative pre-travel test and a Hawaiian stay [&le;] 14 days. We designed for anonymous testing at the end of travel so that travel plans would be unaffected, and we aimed for [&ge;] 70% study participation.

ResultsAmong consecutive eligible travelers, 282 consented and 111 declined to participate, leading to a 72% (67-76%, 95% confidence interval) participation rate. Among 281 tested participants, two were positive with COVID-19, with an estimated positivity rate of 7 cases per 1,000 travelers. The top states of residence are California (58%) and Washington (21%). The mean length of stay was 7.7 {+/-} 0.2 days. Regarding pre-travel testing, 87% had non-nasopharyngeal tests and 66% had self-administered tests.

ConclusionsThis positivity rate leads to an estimated 17-30 infected travelers arriving daily to Maui in November-December 2020, and an estimated 52-70 infected travelers arriving daily to Hawaii during the same period. These counts surpass the Maui District Health Offices projected ability to accommodate 10 infected visitors daily in Maui; therefore, an additional mitigation layer for travelers is recommended.

297,Meta-Analysis of the Dynamics of the Emergence of Mutations and Variants of SARS-CoV-2,"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and is the causative agent for the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a 29,811 nucleotides positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus. Due to inefficient proofreading ability of the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex, coronaviruses are known to acquire new mutations following replication, which constitutes one of the main factors driving the evolution of its genome and the emergence of new genetic variants. In the last few months, the identification of new B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) variants of concern (VOC) highlighted the importance of tracking the emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their impact on transmissibility, infectivity, and neutralizing antibody escape capabilities. These VOC demonstrate increased transmissibility and antibody escape, and reduce current vaccine efficacy. Here we analyzed the appearance and prevalence trajectory of mutations that appeared in all SARS-CoV-2 genes from December 2019 to January 2021. Our goals were to identify which modifications are the most frequent, study the dynamics of their spread, their incorporation into the consensus sequence, and their impact on virus biology. We also analyzed the structural properties of the spike glycoprotein of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants. This study offers an integrative view of the emergence, disappearance, and consensus sequence integration of successful mutations that constitute new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their impact on neutralizing antibody therapeutics and vaccines.

IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19, which has caused > 2 million deaths worldwide as of January, 2021. Mutations occur in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 during viral replication and affect viral infectivity, transmissibility and virulence. In early March 2020, the D614G mutation in the spike protein emerged, which increased the viral transmissibility and is now found in >90% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in GISAID database. Between October and December 2020, B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) variants of concern (VOCs) emerged, which have increased neutralizing antibody escape capabilities because of mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Characterizing mutations in these variants is crucial because of their effect on adaptive immune response, neutralizing antibody therapy, and their impact on vaccine efficacy. Here we tracked and analyzed mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genes over a twelve-month period and investigated functional alterations in the spike of VOCs.",Nicolas Castonguay; Wandong Zhang; Marc-André Langlois,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21252994,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21252994,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True

More knowledge is needed to guide infection control measures.

ObjectiveTo characterize the family index case for detected SARS-CoV-2 and describe testing and secondary attack rates in the family.

DesignRegister-based cohort study.

SettingIndividual-level administrative data of all families and all PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway in 2020.

ParticipantsAll families with at least one parent and one child below the age of 20, who lived at the same address (N=662 582), where at least one member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.

Main outcome measuresSecondary attack rates (SAR7) were defined as the share of non-index family members with a positive PCR test within seven days of the index case. SARs were calculated separately for parent- and child-index cases, and for parent- and child-secondary cases.

ResultsWe identified 7548 index cases, comprising 26 991 individuals, of which 12184 were parents and 14808 children. The index was a parent in 66% of the cases. Among the children, 42% of the index cases were in the age group 17-20 and only 8% 0-6 years. When the index was a parent, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 24 to 25), whilst SAR7 was 14% (95%CI 13 to 15) when the index was a child. However, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 20 to 28) when the index was a child aged 0-6 years and declined steeply with increasing age of the index child. SAR7 from index parent to other parents was 35% (95%CI 33 to 36), and from index child to other children 12% (95%CI 11 to 13). SAR7 from index child aged 0-6 to parents was 27% (95%CI 22 to 33). The percent of non-index family members tested within 7 days after the index case, increased from about 20% in April to 80% in December, however, SAR7 stabilized at about 20% from May.

ConclusionParents and older children are most often index cases for SARS-CoV-2 in families in Norway, while parents and young children more often transmit the virus within the families. This study suggests that whilst the absolute infection numbers are low for young children because of their low introduction rate, when infected, young children and parents transmit the virus to the same extent within the family.

299,"COVID 19 Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of the Healthcare Providers in United Arab Emirates","BackgroundHealth care providers at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, inadequate knowledge and practice about COVID-19, and infection control may lead to increased risk of disease transmission. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of COVID 19 cases is important in preventing transmission and improving patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, altitude, and practice of healthcare providers in the United Arab Emirates toward COVID-19 and to examine its determinants.

MethodA cross-sectional study was conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of Healthcare providers regarding COVID-19. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from of April 11 to July 23, using an online anonymous self-administered questionnaire.

ResultsA total of 2371 healthcare providers responded to the survey. A total of 1091 worked in inpatient hospitals, 494 in primary health care, and 388 in emergency and ICU care. The overall performance score for all healthcare providers was as follows: 49.1%, poor score; 41.8 %, intermediate score; and 9.2%, good score with a mean result of 17.14. Factors leading to better overall performance scores were years of experience, pediatricians specialty, and specialists occupation. A total of 55.7% received good direct knowledge from all healthcare providers. In practice, 48% had good practices toward COVID-19. The overall attitude mean was 2.8, from a maximum score of 7, indicating a positive attitude toward COVID-19.

ConclusionsThe study-demonstrated gaps in specific aspects of knowledge and practice that should be focused on in future education and HCP awareness. A structured training program targeting all HCPs is needed to have good clinical knowledge and practice about COVID-19.",Aljazia Khalfan Alghfeli; Amal Abdul Rahim Al Zarouni; Hamda Musabbah Alremeithi; Roqayah Abdulla Almadhaani; Latifa Baynouna Alketbi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252719,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252719,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
300,First dose mRNA vaccination is sufficient to reactivate immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 in ex COVID-19 subjects,"Characterizing the adaptive immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in individuals who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection may define current and future clinical practice. To determine the effect of two doses BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination schedule in individuals who recovered from COVID-19 (ex COVID-19) compared to naive subjects we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T and B cell responses, as well as specific IgG, IgM and neutralizing antibodies titres in 22 individuals who received BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, 11 of which had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evaluations were performed before vaccination and then weekly until 7 days post second injection. Data obtained clearly showed that one vaccine dose is sufficient to increase both cellular and humoral immune response in ex COVID-19 subjects without any additional improvement after the second dose. On the contrary, the second dose is mandatory in naive ones to further enhance the response. These results question whether a second vaccine jab in ex COVID-19 subjects is required and indicate that millions of vaccine doses may be redirected to naive individuals, thus shortening the time to reach herd immunity.",Alessio Mazzoni; Nicoletta Di Lauria; Laura Maggi; Lorenzo Salvati; Anna Vanni; Manuela Capone; Giulia Lamacchia; Elisabetta Mantengoli; Michele Spinicci; Lorenzo Zammarchi; Seble Tekle Kiros; Maria Grazia Colao; Paola Parronchi; Cristina Scaletti; Lucia Turco; Francesco Liotta; Gian Maria Rossolini; Lorenzo Cosmi; Alessandro Bartoloni; Francesco Annunziato; - COVID-19 Research Group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252590,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252590,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
301,Centenarians and extremely old people living with frailty can elicit durable SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG antibodies with virus neutralization functions following virus infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to more than 114 million COVID-19 cases and >2.5 million deaths worldwide. Epidemiological analysis has revealed that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 increases with age. Despite a disproportionate number of older individuals and long-term care facilities being affected by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, very little is understood about the immune responses and development of humoral immunity in the extremely old person after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we investigated the development of humoral immunity in centenarians following a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility.

MethodsExtreme aged individuals and centenarians who were residents in a long-term care facility and infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were investigated for the development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples were collected from positive and bystander individuals 30 and 60 days after original diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma was used to quantify IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes and subsequent subclasses of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The function of anti-spike was then assessed by virus neutralization assays against the native SARS-CoV-2 virus.

FindingsFifteen long-term care residents were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All individuals had a Clinical Frailty scale score [&ge;]5 and were of extreme older age or were centenarians. Six women with a median age of 98.8 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were the highest titers observed in our cohort with all IgG positive individuals having virus neutralization ability. Additionally, 5 out of the 6 positive participants had a robust IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. In all 5, antibodies were detected after 60 days from initial diagnosis.

InterpretationExtreme older frail individuals and centenarians were able to elicit robust IgG and IgA antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The antibodies were able to neutralize the virus. Humoral responses were still detectable after 60 days from initial diagnosis. Together, these data suggest that recovered participants who are of extreme old age would be protected if re-exposed to the same SARS-CoV-2 viral variant. Considering the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to older age groups and long-term care facilities, the humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 in older age groups is of public health importance and has implications to vaccine responses.

302,Anti-Spike protein assays to determine post-vaccination antibody levels: a head-to-head comparison of five quantitative assays,"BackgroundReliable quantification of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly relevant for identifying possible vaccine failure and estimating the time of protection. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of five different Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays regarding the quantification of anti-spike (S) antibodies induced after a single dose of BNT162b2.

MethodsSera of n=69 SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals 21{+/-}1 days after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) were tested using the following quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays: Roche S total antibody, DiaSorin trimeric spike IgG, DiaSorin S1/S2 IgG, Abbott II IgG, and Serion/Virion IgG. Test agreement was assessed by Passing-Bablok regression. Results were further compared to the percent inhibition calculated from a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) by correlation and ROC (receiver-operating-characteristics) analysis.

ResultsIndividual values were distributed over several orders of magnitude for all assays evaluated. Although the assays were in good overall agreement ({rho}=0.80-0.94), Passing-Bablok regression revealed systematic and proportional differences, which could not be eliminated by converting the results to BAU/mL as suggested by the manufacturers. 7 (10%) individuals had a negative sVNT results (i.e. <30% inhibition). These samples were reliably identified by most assays and yielded low binding antibody levels (ROC-AUCs 0.84-0.93).

ConclusionsAlthough all assays evaluated showed good correlation, readings from different assays were not interchangeable, even when converted to BAU/mL using the WHO international standard for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin. This highlights the need for further standardization of SARS-CoV-2 serology.",Thomas Perkmann MD; Nicole Perkmann-Nagele MD; Thomas Koller MD; Patrick Mucher MSc; Astrid Radakovics MSc; Rodrig Marculescu MD; Michael Wolzt MD; Oswald F Wagner MD; Christoph J Binder MD PhD; Helmuth Haslacher MD PhD,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252977,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252977,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
303,Investigating the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine using epidemiological and genomic sequencing data,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread around the globe. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020 just three months after the introduction of the virus. Individual nations have implemented and enforced with varying degrees of success a variety of social distancing interventions to slow the virus spread. Investigating the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 transmission in different settings is an important research. While most transmission modeling studies have focused on the dynamics in China, neighboring Asian counties, Western Europe, and North America, there is a scarcity of studies for Eastern Europe. This study starts to fill this gap by analyzing the characteristics of the first epidemic wave in Ukraine using mathematical and statistical models together with epidemiological and genomic sequencing data. Using an agent-based model, the trajectory of the first wave in terms of cases and deaths and explore the impact of quarantine strategies via simulation studies have been characterized. The implemented stochastic model for epidemic counts suggests, that even a small delay of weeks could have increased the number of cases by up to 50%, with the potential to overwhelm hospital systems. The genomic data analysis suggests that there have been multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Ukraine during the early stages of the epidemic with eight distinct transmission clusters identified. The basic reproduction number for the epidemic has been estimated independently both from case counts data and from genomic data. The findings support the hypothesis that, the public health measures did not have a decreasing effect on the existing viral population number at the time of implementation, since strains were detected after the quarantine date. However, the public health measures did help to prevent the appearance of new (and potentially more virulent) SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ukraine.",Yuriy Gankin; Vladimir Koniukhovskii; Alina Nemira; Gerardo Chowell; Thomas A.

304,Long-Term Duration of Antibody Response to SARS CoV-2 in One of the Largest Slums of Buenos Aires,"The durability of the antibody response following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections has not been fully elucidated. We have performed a cross-sectional study in one of the largest slums of Buenos Aires, Barrio Padre Mugica in June 2020, detecting a seroprevalence of 53.4%. To evaluate the persistence of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in this area, we designed a second study assessing only the people that were IgG positive in the first survey. The IgG levels against the full spike (S) protein in 175 individuals that were seropositive, at least 6 months before, were evaluated in a second survey. The positivity rate was 92.0%, 161 from 175 individuals remained IgG positive. We observed a contraction in the overall IgG levels measured by ELISA. The median IgG dropped 62% from June to December 2020. Most of the individuals tested (87%) reported to be asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic. No difference was found between men and women, but people aged less than 50 showed a lower IgG level in each period compared to older individuals.

305,"SARS-CoV2 sero-survey among adults involved in health care and health research in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa","BackgroundMany African countries have reported fewer COVID-19 cases than countries elsewhere. By the end of 2020, Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, had <2500 PCR-confirmed cases corresponding to 0.1% of the [~]1.8 million national population. We assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in urban Guinea-Bissau.

MethodsWe measured IgG antibody in point-of-care rapid tests among 140 staff and associates at a biometric research field station in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, during November 2020.

ResultsOf 140 participants, 25 (18%) were IgG-positive. Among IgG-positives, 12 (48%) reported an episode of illness since the onset of the pandemic. Twenty-five (18%) participants had been PCR-tested between May and September; 7 (28%) were PCR-positive. Four of these 7 tested IgG-negative in the present study. Five participants reported a death in their house, corresponding to a crude annual death rate of 4.5/1000 people; no death was attributed to COVID-19.

ConclusionsIn spite of low official number of COVID-19 cases, our serosurvey found a high prevalence of IgG-positivity. Most IgG-positives had not been ill. The official number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases grossly underestimates the prevalence during the pandemic.

However, no pregnant or lactating individuals were included in the Phase 3 clinical trials of these vaccines despite belonging to a group at high risk for severe complications of COVID-19 infection. We show here that the mRNA from anti-COVID BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines is not detected in human breast milk samples collected 4-48 hours post-vaccine.

308,More than the eye can see; shedding new light on SARS-CoV-2 Lateral Flow Device-based immunoassays,"Containing the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge due to high rates of both horizontal transmissivity and asymptomatic carriage. Lateral Flow Device (LFD) immunoassays were introduced in late 2020 to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals in the population. Although LFD technologies have been used for over 60 years, their widespread use as a public health tool during a pandemic is unprecedented. By the end of 2020, data from studies into the efficacy of the LFDs emerged and showed these point-of-care devices to have very high specificity (ability to identify true negatives), but inadequate sensitivity with high false-negative rates. In particular, the low sensitivity (<50%) shown in several studies is a critical public health concern, given that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers may wrongly be assumed to be non-infectious, and posing a significant risk of further spread in the community. Here we show that the direct visual readout of SARS-CoV-2 LFDs is an inadequate approach to discriminate a potentially infective viral concentration in a bio-sample. Using high sensitivity synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging we were able to quantify significant immobilized antigen-antibody-label conjugates within the LFDs visually scored as negative. Correlating quantitative X-ray fluorescence measurements and qRT-PCR determined numbers of viral copies we identified that negatively scored samples could contain up to 100 PFU (equivalent here to [~]10,000 RNA copies/test). This is of significant concern should these tests be used to control community spread. The study demonstrates where the shortcomings arise in many of the current direct-readout SARS-CoV-2 LFDs, namely being a deficiency in the readout as opposed to the potential level of detection of the test which is orders of magnitude higher. Our findings are of importance both to public health monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic and to the rapid refinement of these tools for immediate and future applications.",Garrit Koller; Alexander P Morrell; Rui Galao; Suzanne Pickering; Eithne MacMahon; Joanna Johnson; Konstantin Ignatyev; Stuart JD Neil; Sherif Elsharkawy; Roland Fleck; Pedro Machado; Owen Addison,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21253048,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21253048,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
309,A Simple RT-PCR Melting temperature Assay to Rapidly Screen for Widely Circulating SARS-CoV-2 Variants.,"BackgroundThe emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B1.351) and Brazil (P.1) requires a vigorous public health response, including real time strain surveillance on a global scale. Although new SARS-CoV-2 variants can be most accurately identified by genomic sequencing, this approach is time consuming and expensive. A simple and more rapid screen for the key SARS-CoV-2 mutations that define variant strains is needed. We developed a simple, rapid and high-throughput reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) melting temperature assay that identifies the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutation, a key mutation which is present in all three known variant strains of concern.

MethodsRT-PCR primers and two sloppy molecular beacon (SMB) probes were designed to amplify and detect the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y (A23063T) mutation. One SMB was designed with a probe region that was complementary to the wild type sequence (WT) and a second SMB was designed with a probe region that was complementary to the mutant (MT) sequence. Each SMB was labeled with a different fluorophore, and the assay was performed in a single test well. After RT-PCR, WT versus MT SARS-CoV-2 was identified by a characteristic shift in the melting temperature (Tm) of each SMB. Assay optimization and testing was performed with RNA from SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1/2020 (WT) and SARS-CoV-2 hCoV-19/England/204820464/2020 (a B.1.17 variant). The assay was then validated using clinical samples.

ResultsThe limit of detection (LOD) of the assay for both the WT and the B1.1.7 variant was 4 genomic copies/reaction. The two SMBs produced Tm shifts that were 100% sensitive and 100% specific for identifying the N501Y mutation in cultured virus and in clinical samples as confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

ConclusionWe have developed a rapid screening test for the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutation, which is a characteristic of all three SARS-CoV-2 stains of global concern. This assay can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of patient samples for these variants, providing an early warning for the emergence and spread of these strains of concern.",Padmapriya P.

310,Value-based pricing of a COVID-19 vaccine,"AimThe purpose of this study is to determine the value-based price of a COVID-19 vaccine from a societal perspective in Germany.

MethodsA decision model was constructed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, intensive care unit (ICU) costs and outcomes, and herd protection threshold. Three strategies were analysed: vaccination (with 95% and 50% efficacy), a mitigation strategy, and no intervention. The base-case time horizon was 5 years. The value of a vaccine included savings from avoiding COVID-19 mitigation measures and health benefits from avoiding COVID-19 related mortality. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19.

ResultsA vaccine with a 95% efficacy dominates the mitigation strategy strictly. The value-based price ({euro}1494) is thus determined by the comparison between vaccination and no intervention. This price is particularly sensitive to the probability of ICU admission and the herd protection threshold. In contrast, the value of a vaccine with 50% efficacy is more ambiguous.

ConclusionThis study yields a value-based price for a COVID-19 vaccine with 95% efficacy, which is more than 50 times greater than the purchasing price.",Afschin Gandjour,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21253035,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21253035,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
311,The relationship between new PCR positive cases and going out in public during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan,"Suppression of the first wave of COVID-19 in Japan is assumedly attributable to peoples increased risk perception by acquiring information from the government and media reports. In this study, going out in public amidst the spread of COVID-19 infections was investigated by examining new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive cases of COVID-19 and its relationship to four indicators of people going out in public (the people flow, the index of web searches for going outside, the number of times people browse restaurants, and the number of hotel guests), from the Regional Economic and Social Analysis System (V-RESAS). Two waves of COVID-19 infections were examined with cross-correlation analysis. In the first wave, all four indicators of going out reacted oppositely with the change in new PCR positive cases, showing a lag period of -1 to +6 weeks. In the second wave, the same relationship was only observed for the index of web searches for going outside. These results suggest that going out in public could not be described by new PCR positive cases alone in the second wave, even though they could explain people going out to some extent in the first wave.",Hiromichi Takahashi; Iori Terada; Takuya Higuchi; Daisuke Takada; Jung-ho Shin; Susumu Kunisawa; Yuichi Imanaka,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21252959,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21252959,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
312,OpenSAFELY: Risks of COVID-19 hospital admission and death for people with learning disabilities - a cohort study.,"ObjectivesTo assess the association between learning disability and risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 in England among adults and children.

DesignWorking on behalf of NHS England, two cohort studies using patient-level data for >17 million people from primary care electronic health records were linked with death data from the Office for National Statistics and hospitalization data from NHS Secondary Uses Service using the OpenSAFELY platform.

SettingGeneral practices in England which use TPP software.

ParticipantsParticipants were males and females, aged up to 105 years, from two cohorts: (1) wave 1, registered with a TPP practice as of 1st March 2020 and followed until 31st August, 2020; (2) wave 2 registered 1st September 2020 and followed until 31st December 2020 (for admissions) or 8th February 2021 (for deaths). The main exposure group was people included on a general practice learning disability register (LDR), with a subgroup of people classified as having profound or severe learning disability. We also identified patients with Down syndrome and cerebral palsy (whether or not on the learning disability register).

Main outcome measures(i) COVID-19 related death, (ii) COVID-19 related hospitalisation. Non-COVID-19 related death was also explored.

ResultsIn wave 1, of 14,301,415 included individuals aged 16 and over, 90,095 (0.63%) were identified as being on the LDR. 30,173 COVID-related hospital admissions, 13,919 COVID-19 related deaths and 69,803 non-COVID deaths occurred; of which 538 (1.8%), 221 (1.6%) and 596 (0.85%) were among individuals on the LDR, respectively. In wave 2, 27,611 COVID-related hospital admissions, 17,933 COVID-19 related deaths and 54,171 non-COVID deaths occurred; of which 383 (1.4%), 260 (1.4%) and 470 (0.87%) were among individuals on the LDR. Wave 1 hazard ratios for individuals on the LDR, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and geographical location, were 5.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9, 5.8) for COVID-19 related hospital admissions and 8.2 (95% CI: 7.1, 9.4) for COVID-19 related death. Wave 2 produced similar estimates. Associations were stronger among those classed as severe-profound and among those in residential care. Down syndrome and cerebral palsy were associated with increased hazard of both events in both waves; Down syndrome to a much greater extent. Hazards of non-COVID-19 related death followed similar patterns with weaker associations.

ConclusionsPeople with learning disabilities have markedly increased risks of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19. This raised risk is over and above that seen for non-COVID causes of death.

313,"Absent or insufficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies at ICU admission are associated to higher viral loads in plasma, antigenemia and mortality in COVID-19 patients","Purposeto evaluate the association between anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgM and IgG antibodies with viral RNA load in plasma, the frequency of antigenemia and with the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Methodsanti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies levels, viral RNA load and antigenemia were profiled in plasma of 92 adult patients in the first 24 hours following ICU admission. The impact of these variables on 30-day mortality was assessed by using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis.

Resultsnon survivors showed more frequently absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG and IgM antibodies than survivors (26.3% vs 5.6% for IgM and 18.4% vs 5.6% for IgG), and a higher frequency of antigenemia (47.4% vs 22.2%) (p <0.05). Non survivors showed lower concentrations of anti-S IgG and IgM and higher viral RNA loads in plasma, which were associated to increased 30-day mortality and decreased survival mean time. [Adjusted HR (CI95%), p]: [S IgM (AUC [&ge;]60): 0.48 (0.24; 0.97), 0.040]; [S IgG (AUC [&ge;]237): 0.47 (0.23; 0.97), 0.042]; [Antigenemia (+): 2.45 (1.27; 4.71), 0.007]; [N1 viral load ([&ge;] 2.156 copies/mL): 2.21 (1.11; 4.39),0.024]; [N2 viral load ([&ge;] 3.035 copies/mL): 2.32 (1.16; 4.63), 0.017]. Frequency of antigenemia was >2.5-fold higher in patients with absence of antibodies. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies correlated inversely with viral RNA load.

Conclusionabsence / insufficient levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies following ICU admission is associated to poor viral control, evidenced by increased viral RNA loads in plasma, higher frequency of antigenemia, and also to increased 30-day mortality.

Take-home messageabsent or low levels of antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV- 2 at ICU admission is associated to an increased risk of mortality, higher frequency of antigenemia and higher viral RNA loads in plasma.

314,"Long-term clinical, virological and immunological outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID-19: antibody response predicts long COVID.","ObjectiveLong-term data following SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited. We aimed to characterize the medium and long-term clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes after hospitalization for COVID-19, and to identify predictors of long-COVID.

MethodsProspective, longitudinal study conducted in COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR. Serial blood and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were obtained for measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG antibodies during hospital stay, and at 1, 2 and 6 months post-discharge. Genome sequencing was performed where appropriate. Patients filled out a COVID19-symptom-questionnaire (CSQ) at 2-month and 6-month visits, and those with highest scores were characterized.

ResultsOf 146 patients (60% male, median age 64 years) followed-up, 20.6% required hospital readmission and 5.5% died. At 2-months and 6-months, 9.6% and 7.8% patients, respectively, reported moderate/severe persistent symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive in NPS in 11.8% (median Ct=38) and 3% (median Ct=36) patients at 2-months and 6-months, respectively, but no reinfections were demonstrated.

Antibody titers gradually waned, with seroreversion occurring at 6 months in 27 (27.6%) patients for N-IgG and in 6 (6%) for S-IgG. Adjusted 2-month predictors of the highest CSQ scores (OR [95%CI]) were lower peak S-IgG (0.80 [0.66-0.94]) and higher WHO-severity-score (2.57 [1.20-5.86]); 6-month predictors were lower peak S-IgG (0.89 [0.79-0.99]) and female sex (2.41 [1.20-4.82]); no association was found with prolonged viral shedding.

ConclusionsLate clinical events and persistent symptoms in the medium and long term occurred in a significant proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Gender, severity of illness and weaker antibody responses, but not viral shedding, were associated with long-COVID.

SummaryThis study characterizes the long-term clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes following COVID-19 hospitalization.

315,Inflammatory but not respiratory symptoms associated with ongoing upper airway viral replication in outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19,"BackgroundThe vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are uncomplicated and do not require hospitalization, but contribute to ongoing transmission. Our understanding of the clinical course of uncomplicated COVID-19 remains limited.

MethodsWe detailed the natural history of uncomplicated COVID-19 among 120 outpatients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of Peginterferon Lambda. We characterized symptom trajectory and clusters using exploratory factor analysis, assessed predictors of symptom resolution and cessation of oropharyngeal viral shedding using Cox proportional hazard models, and evaluated associations between symptoms and viral shedding using mixed effects linear models.

ResultsHeadache, myalgias and chills peaked at day 4 after symptom onset; cough peaked on day 9. Two distinct symptom cluster trajectories were identified; one with mild, upper respiratory symptoms, and the other with more severe and prolonged inflammatory symptoms. The median time to symptom resolution from earliest symptom onset was 17 days (95% CI 14-18). Neither enrollment SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.88, 95% CI 0.84-4.20) nor oropharyngeal viral load at enrollment (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.05) were significantly associated with the time to symptom resolution. The median time to cessation of viral shedding was 10 days (95% CI 8-12), with higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels at enrollment associated with hastened resolution of viral shedding (HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.4-6.9, p=0.005). Myalgia, joint pains, and chills were associated with a significantly greater odds of oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

ConclusionsIn this outpatient cohort, inflammatory symptoms peaked early and were associated with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication. SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with more rapid viral shedding cessation, but not with time to symptom resolution.

317,"Low Dose Regimens of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Exceed SARS-Cov-2 Correlate of Protection Estimates for Symptomatic Infection, in those 19-55 Years of Age","BackgroundAn exact correlate of protection (CoP) is not yet known for symptomatic COVID-19. However, it is still possible to show a new vaccine regimen exceeds an unknown CoP, provided the regimen shows an equivalent or greater immunological response in all measured indicators relative to the immunological response elicited by a clinically proven vaccine regimen. The principle of comparing immunogenicity between regimens is what the FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium use to authorize modifications to the vaccines for VOC, without requiring clinical efficacy studies before implementation. It is logical to apply the same principle to modifying vaccine doses if the data is available to do so. A two dose 30ug regimen of BNT162b2 has strong clinical evidence of efficacy, as does a single dose 30 ug regimen. The immunological markers for these regimens have been profiled in detail in Phase 1 and 2 trial data.

MethodsThe immunological profile (including binding antibodies, viral neutralization, cytokine profiles, and CD4 and 8 expansion) of the 2 dose 30ug BNT162b2 vaccine is examined, referred to as a highly conservative CoP estimate. The single dose 30 ug BNT162b2 immunological profile is also examined, a tenable CoP estimate. Data from the phase 1 and 2 trials are examined to see if alternate regimens meet or exceed the level of each immune marker measured, relative to the regimens listed above that have proven clinical efficacy.

ResultsFor adults aged 19-55, a 2 dose 10ug BNT162b2 regimen elicits a comparable response to the standard 30 ug dose for each immune indicator, with viral neutralization nearly an order of magnitude greater than the tenable CoP estimate. Similarly, a single dose 10ug BNT 162b2 regimen or a two dose 1ug BNT 162b2 regimen equals or exceeds the immunogenicity of a single 30 ug dose.

ConclusionIf it is reasonable for the FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium to approve vaccine modifications without a clinical trial based on immunogenicity data, three alternate low dose regimens were identified that meet the requirements of having comparable immunogenicity relative to a protocol that has proven clinical efficacy. Immediate implementation of these lower dose regimens should be considered as they have major implications in alleviating vaccine supply, as well as improving vaccine side effect profile, and lowering total cost of vaccination.",Graham Jurgens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21253058,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.21253058,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,,True
318,"Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data","BackgroundSchools have been closed in England since the 4th of January 2021 as part of the national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK Government plans to reopen schools on the 8th of March. Although there is evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings are not clear.

MethodsWe measured social contacts when schools were both open or closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number.

ResultsOur results suggest that reopening all schools could increase R from an assumed baseline of 0.8 to between 1.0 and 1.5, or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone.

ConclusionOur results suggest that reopening schools is likely to halt the fall in cases observed in recent months and risks returning to rising infections, but these estimates rely heavily on the current estimates or reproduction number and the current validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we use.",James D Munday; Christopher I Jarvis; Amy Gimma; Kerry LM Wong; Kevin van Zandvoort; - CMMID COVID-19 Working Group; Sebastian Funk; W.

319,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in care home staff: a survey of Liverpool care homes,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has caused high morbidity and mortality in UK care homes. Vaccinating staff members and residents will protect care homes from severe clinical cases. Uptake of COVID-19 vaccine first doses in care homes has been higher among residents compared to staff members.

MethodsWe aimed to identify causes of lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake amongst care home staff members within the Liverpool City Council region. An anonymised online survey was distributed to all care home managers between the 21st and the 29th of January 2021. Descriptive analysis was performed on responses.

Results46/87 (53%) of Liverpool care homes responded. The mean staff vaccination rate per home was 51.4% (95% CI 43.9-58.8%). The most common reasons for staff not receiving the vaccine were: concerns about lack of vaccine research (37.0%), staff being off-site during vaccination sessions (36.5%), pregnancy and fertility concerns (5.6%), and concerns about allergic reactions (3.2%). Care home managers reported the necessity to combat vaccine hesitancy through meetings and conversations with health professionals, and provision of supporting evidence to dispel vaccine misinformation.

ConclusionsVaccine hesitancy was the main cause for reduced vaccine uptake among care home staff members. These concerns could be addressed by targeted evidence-based training, and a public health communication campaign to build vaccine confidence and increase acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. The speed of vaccination roll-out has also led to unexpected logistical issues that lowered vaccine uptake rates. Addressing both these challenges could increase uptake by more than 40%.

Key PointsO_LICOVID-19 vaccine uptake rates are lower in staff than residents
C_LIO_LIThree main causes of reduced uptake have been identified: vaccine hesitancy, logistical issues, and medical concerns.
C_LIO_LIThe main reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about limited research into vaccine safety, and concerns about long-term impact on pregnancy and fertility.

320,Rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 detected in sewage samples from England between October 2020 and January 2021,"SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple amino acid mutations in the spike protein are emerging in different parts of the world raising concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. Recently, a variant named lineage B.1.1.7 was detected and shown to be rapidly spreading across the UK since November 2020. As surveillance for these SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) becomes critical, we have investigated the use of environmental surveillance (ES) for the rapid detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 viruses in sewage as a way of monitoring its expansion that is independent on the investigation of identified clinical cases. B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences from sewage were first identified in a sample collected in London on 10th November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs becoming prevalent in the population and that, as well as B.1.1.7, our method can potentially detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1, first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and other viruses also carrying critical spike mutation E484K, known to have an effect on virus antigenicity.",Thomas Wilton; Erika Bujaki; Dimitra Klapsa; Martin Fritzsche; Ryan Mate; Javier Martin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252867,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252867,2021-03-07,2021-03-07,,True
321,Prevalence of vitamin D is not associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe. A judicial update of the existing evidence.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 104 million people worldwide as of February 4th 2021. In previous published studies, the association between the mean Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection rate, and mortality among the adult population in European countries was examined. The aim of this study was to re-examine the relationship between the Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a different methodological approach.

MethodsInformation only form the last decade on Vit D concentration/deficiency for each country was retrieved through literature search on PubMed(R) database. As of February, 4th 2021, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per one million population as well as total recoveries were extracted from the Worldometer website. The association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots.

FindingsThe prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries ranged from 6.0 (Finland) to 75.5% (Turkey), with several countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their population. Non-significant correlations were observed between the number of COVID-19 infections (r=0.190; p=0.374), recoveries (rs=0.317, p=0.131), and mortalities (r=0.129; p=0.549) per one million population, with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

InterpretationPrevalence of vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated with either number of infections, recoveries or mortality rate of COVID-19 among European countries. Thus, it is an important parameter to be considered when implementing preventive measures to face COVID-19.

AimWe tested Norway rats inhabiting the sewer system of Antwerp, Belgium, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 following a local COVID-19 epidemic peak. In addition, we discuss the use and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests on non-human samples.

MethodsBetween November and December 2020, Norway rat oral swabs, feces and tissues from the sewer system of Antwerp were collected to be tested by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a Luminex microsphere immunoassay (MIA). Samples considered positive were then checked for neutralizing antibodies using a conventional viral neutralization test (cVNT).

ResultsThe serum of 35 rats was tested by MIA showing 3 potentially positive sera that were later shown to be negative by cVNT. All tissue samples of 39 rats analyzed tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

ConclusionThis is the first study that evaluates SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban rats. We can conclude that the sample of 39 rats had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

To date, the genomes of global COVID-19 variants have been primarily characterized via short-read sequencing methods. Here, we devised a long-read RNA (IsoSeq) sequencing approach to characterize the COVID-19 transcript landscape and expression of its [~]27 coding regions. Our analysis identified novel COVID-19 transcripts including a) a short [~]65-70 nt 5-UTR fused to various downstream ORFs encoding accessory proteins such as the envelope, ORF 8, and ORF 9 (nucleocapsid) proteins, that are relatively highly expressed, b) novel SNVs that are differentially expressed, whereby a subset are suggestive of partial RNA editing events, and c) SNVs at functional sites, whereby at least one is associated with a differentially expressed spike protein isoform.

325,Resolving the Dynamic Motions of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 Proteins Using Structural Proteomics,"Coronavirus (CoV) non-structural proteins (nsps) assemble to form the replication-transcription complex (RTC) responsible for viral RNA synthesis. nsp7 and nsp8 are important cofactors of the RTC, as they interact and regulate the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and other nsps. To date, no structure of full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7:nsp8 complex has been published. Current understanding of this complex is based on structures from truncated constructs or with missing electron densities and complexes from related CoV species with which SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 share upwards of 90% sequence identity. Despite available structures being solved using crystallography and cryo-EM representing detailed snapshots of the nsp7:nsp8 complex, it is evident that the complex has a high degree of structural plasticity. However, relatively little is known about the conformational dynamics of the complex and how it assembles to interact with other nsps. Here, the solution-based structural proteomic techniques, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), illuminate the structural dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp7:nsp8 complex. The results presented from the two techniques are complementary and validate the interaction surfaces identified from the published three-dimensional heterotetrameric crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 truncated nsp7:nsp8 complex. Furthermore, mapping of XL-MS data onto higher order complexes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 do not assemble into a hexadecameric structure as implied by the SARS-CoV full-length nsp7:nsp8 crystal structure. Instead our results suggest that the nsp7:nsp8 heterotetramer can dissociate into a stable dimeric unit that might bind to nsp12 in the RTC without altering nsp7-nsp8 interactions.",Valentine Courouble; Sanjay Dey; Ruchi Yadav; Jennifer Timm; Jerry Harrison; Francesc X Ruiz; Eddy Arnold; Patrick R Griffin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.434214,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.06.434214,2021-03-06,2021-03-06,,False

In contrast to an earlier study where sera from individuals infected with the original variant showed dramatically reduced potency against 501Y.V2, sera from 501Y.V2-infected patients maintained good cross-reactivity against viruses from the first wave. Furthermore, sera from 501Y.V2-infected patients also neutralized the 501Y.V3 (P.1) variant first described in Brazil, and now circulating globally.

However, two SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred among intercollegiate university athletic programs during the fall 2020 semester despite mandatory directly observed daily antigen testing.

MethodsDuring the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using Quidels Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two outbreaks.

ResultsIn Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related, suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12 confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and unique from strains circulating in the community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that antigen testing alone, even when mandated and directly observed, may not be sufficient as an intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, and highlights the importance of supplementing serial antigen testing with appropriate mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in congregate settings.

328,The COVID-19 health equity twindemic: Statewide epidemiologic trends of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes among racial minorities and in rural America,"BackgroundEarly studies on COVID-19 identified unequal patterns in hospitalization and mortality in urban environments for racial and ethnic minorities. These studies were primarily single center observational studies conducted within the first few weeks or months of the pandemic. We sought to examine trends in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality over time for minority and rural populations, especially during the U.S. fall surge.

MethodsStatewide cohort of all adult residents in Indiana tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and December 31, 2020, linked to electronic health records. Primary measures were per capita rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Age adjusted rates were calculated for multiple time periods corresponding to public health mitigation efforts.

ResultsMorbidity and mortality increased over time with notable differences among sub-populations. Initially, per capita hospitalizations among racial minorities were 3-4 times higher than whites, and per capita deaths among urban residents were twice those of rural residents. By fall 2020, per capita hospitalizations and deaths in rural areas surpassed those of urban areas, and gaps between black/brown and white populations narrowed. Cumulative morbidity and mortality were highest among minority groups and in rural communities.

ConclusionsBurden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality shifted over time, creating a twindemic involving disparities in outcomes based on race and geography.

330,Multi-Omic Profiling of Plasma Identify Biomarkers and Pathogenesis of COVID-19 in Children,"Although children usually develop less severe disease responding to COVID-19 than adults, little is known about the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in children. Herein, we conducted the plasma proteomic and metabolomic profiling of a cohort of COVID-19 pediatric patients with mild symptoms. Our data show that numerous proteins and metabolites involved in immune as well as anti-inflammatory processes were up-regulated on a larger scale in children than in adults. By developing a machine learning-based pipeline, we prioritized two sets of biomarker combinations, and identified 5 proteins and 5 metabolites as potential children-specific COVID-19 biomarkers. Further study showed that these identified metabolites not only inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, but also suppressed coronaviral replication, implying that these factors played key roles in protecting pediatric patients from both viral infection and infection-induced inflammation. Together, our study uncovered a protective mechanism responding to COVID-19 in children, and sheds light on potential therapies.

331,Longitudinal Analysis Reveals Distinct Antibody and Memory B Cell Responses in SARS-CoV2 Naive and Recovered Individuals Following mRNA Vaccination,"Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have been authorized for emergency use and are currently being administered to millions of individuals worldwide. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with a prior SARS-CoV2 infection compared to SARS-CoV2 naive subjects. Moreover, how mRNA vaccines impact the development of antibodies as well as memory B cells in COVID-19 experienced versus COVID-19 naive subjects remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated antibody responses and antigen-specific memory B cell responses over time in 33 SARS-CoV2 naive and 11 SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects. mRNA vaccination induced significant antibody and memory B cell responses against full-length SARS-CoV2 spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV2 naive individuals benefitted from both doses of mRNA vaccine with additional increases in antibodies and memory B cells following booster immunization. In contrast, SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had a significant immune response after the first dose with no increase in circulating antibodies or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. Moreover, the magnitude of the memory B cell response induced by vaccination was lower in older individuals, revealing an age-dependence to mRNA vaccine-induced B cell memory. Side effects also tended to associate with post-boost antibody levels, but not with post-boost memory B cells, suggesting that side effect severity may be a surrogate of short-term antibody responses. The frequency of pre-vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals strongly correlated with post-vaccine antibody levels, supporting a key role for memory B cells in humoral recall responses to SARS-CoV2. This observation may have relevance for future booster vaccines and for responses to viral variants that partially escape pre-existing antibodies and require new humoral responses to be generated from memory B cells. Finally, post-boost antibody levels were not correlated with post-boost memory responses in SARS-CoV2 naive individuals, indicating that short-term antibody levels and memory B cells are complementary immunological endpoints that should be examined in tandem when evaluating vaccine response. Together, our data provide evidence of both serological response and immunological memory following mRNA vaccination that is distinct based on prior SARS-CoV2 exposure. These findings may inform vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.

332,REACT-1 round 9 final report: Continued but slowing decline of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 during national lockdown in England in February 2021,"BackgroundEngland will start to exit its third national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on 8th March 2021, with safe effective vaccines being rolled out rapidly against a background of emerging transmissible and immunologically novel variants of SARS-CoV-2. A subsequent increase in community prevalence of infection could delay further relaxation of lockdown if vaccine uptake and efficacy are not sufficiently high to prevent increased pressure on healthcare services.

MethodsThe PCR self-swab arm of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission Study (REACT-1) estimates community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on random cross-sections of the population ages five and over. Here, we present results from the complete round 9 of REACT-1 comprising round 9a in which swabs were collected from 4th to 12th February 2021 and round 9b from 13th to 23rd February 2021. We also compare the results of REACT-1 round 9 to round 8, in which swabs were collected mainly from 6th January to 22nd January 2021.

ResultsOut of 165,456 results for round 9 overall, 689 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%), representing a fall of over two thirds from round 8. However the rate of decline of the epidemic has slowed from 15 (13, 17) days, estimated for the period from the end of round 8 to the start of round 9, to 31 days estimated using data from round 9 alone (lower confidence limit 17 days). When comparing round 9a to 9b there were apparent falls in four regions, no apparent change in one region and apparent rises in four regions, including London where there was a suggestion of sub-regional heterogeneity in growth and decline. Smoothed prevalence maps suggest large contiguous areas of growth and decline that do not align with administrative regions.

Prevalence fell by 50% or more across all age groups in round 9 compared to round 8, with prevalence (round 9) ranging from 0.21% in those aged 65 and over to 0.71% in those aged 13 to 17 years. Round 9 prevalence was highest among Pakistani participants at 2.1% compared to white participants at 0.45% and Black participants at 0.83%. There were higher adjusted odds of infection for healthcare and care home workers, for those working in public transport and those working in education, school, nursery or childcare and lower adjusted odds for those not required to work outside the home.

ConclusionsCommunity prevalence of swab-positivity has declined markedly between January and February 2021 during lockdown in England, but remains high; the rate of decline has slowed in the most recent period, with a suggestion of pockets of growth. Continued adherence to social distancing and public health measures is required so that infection rates fall to much lower levels. This will help to ensure that the benefits of the vaccination roll-out programme in England are fully realised.",Steven Riley; Caroline E. Walters; Haowei Wang; Oliver Eales; David Haw; Kylie E. C.

333,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody magnitude and detectability are driven by disease severity, timing, and assay","Serosurveillance studies are critical for estimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission and immunity, but interpretation of results is currently limited by poorly defined variability in the performance of antibody assays to detect seroreactivity over time in individuals with different clinical presentations. We measured longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in plasma samples from a diverse cohort of 128 individuals over 160 days using 14 binding and neutralization assays. For all assays, we found a consistent and strong effect of disease severity on antibody magnitude, with fever, cough, hospitalization, and oxygen requirement explaining much of this variation. We found that binding assays measuring responses to spike protein had consistently higher correlation with neutralization than those measuring responses to nucleocapsid, regardless of assay format and sample timing. However, assays varied substantially with respect to sensitivity during early convalescence and in time to seroreversion. Variations in sensitivity and durability were particularly dramatic for individuals with mild infection, who had consistently lower antibody titers and represent the majority of the infected population, with sensitivities often differing substantially from reported test characteristics (e.g., amongst commercial assays, sensitivity at 6 months ranged from 33% for ARCHITECT IgG to 98% for VITROS Total Ig). Thus, the ability to detect previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 is highly dependent on the severity of the initial infection, timing relative to infection, and the assay used. These findings have important implications for the design and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies.",Michael J Peluso; Saki Takahashi; Jill Hakim; J.

334,"COVID Symptoms, Symptom Clusters, and Predictors for Becoming a Long-Hauler:Looking for Clarity in the Haze of the Pandemic","Emerging data suggest that the effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 are far reaching extending beyond those with severe acute disease. Specifically, the presence of persistent symptoms after apparent resolution from COVID-19 have frequently been reported throughout the pandemic by individuals labeled as ""long-haulers"". The purpose of this study was to assess for symptoms at days 0-10 and 61+ among subjects with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The University of California COvid Research Data Set (UC CORDS) was used to identify 1407 records that met inclusion criteria. Symptoms attributable to COVID-19 were extracted from the electronic health record. Symptoms reported over the previous year prior to COVID-19 were excluded, using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) followed by graph lasso to assess relationships between symptoms. A model was developed predictive for becoming a long-hauler based on symptoms. 27% reported persistent symptoms after 60 days. Women were more likely to become long-haulers, and all age groups were represented with those aged 50 {+/-} 20 years comprising 72% of cases. Presenting symptoms included palpitations, chronic rhinitis, dysgeusia, chills, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, anxiety, sore throat, and headache among others. We identified 5 symptom clusters at day 61+: chest pain-cough, dyspnea-cough, anxiety-tachycardia, abdominal pain-nausea, and low back pain-joint pain. Long-haulers represent a very significant public health concern, and there are no guidelines to address their diagnosis and management.

335,SARS-CoV-2 Load does not Predict Transmissibility in College Students,"SARS-CoV2 is highly contagious and the global spread has caused significant medical, social and economic impacts. Other than vaccination, effective public health measures, including contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, is critical for deterring viral transmission, preventing infection progression and resuming normal activities. Viral transmission is affected by many factors but the viral load and vitality could be among the most important ones. Although in vitro culture studies have indicated that the amount of virus isolated from infected people determines the successful rate of virus isolation, whether the viral load carried at the individual level would affect the transmissibility was not known. We aimed to determine whether the Ct value, a measurement of viral load by RT-PCR assay, could differentiate the spreader from the non-spreader in a population of college students. Our results indicate that while at the population level the Ct value is lower, suggesting a higher viral load, in the symptomatic spreaders than the asymptomatic non-spreaders, there is a significant overlap in the Ct values between the two groups. Thus Ct values, or the viral load, at the individual level could not predict the transmissibility. Our studies also suggest that a sensitive method to detect the presence of virus is needed to identify asymptomatic persons who may carry a low viral load but can still be infectious.",Di Tian; Zhen Lin; Ellie M.

Real-life data on immune responses elicited in the most vulnerable group of vaccinees over 80 years old is still underrepresented despite the prioritization of the elderly in vaccination campaigns.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study with two age groups, young vaccinees below the age of 60 and elderly vaccinees over the age of 80, to compare their antibody responses to the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination.

ResultsWhile the majority of participants in both groups produced specific IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, titers were significantly lower in elderly participants. Although the increment of antibody levels after the second immunization was higher in elderly participants, the absolute mean titer of this group remained lower than the <60 group. After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2% had no detectable neutralizing antibodies.

All samples were collected from individuals who reported no symptoms associated with COVID-19 on the day of collection. From these, 1,405 positive cases were identified. The distribution of viral loads within these asymptomatic individuals was indistinguishable from what has been previously reported in symptomatic individuals. Regardless of symptomatic status, approximately 50% of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 seem to be in non-infectious phases of the disease, based on having low viral loads in a range from which live virus has rarely been isolated.

ObjectivesTo examine the risk factors for in-hospital mortality and describe the effectiveness of different treatment strategies in a real-life setting of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia.

DesignReal-life single-center study during the Lombardy COVID-19 outbreak.

SettingValduce Hospital in Como, Lombardy Region, Italy.

Participants205 laboratory-confirmed patients presenting with SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia requiring hospitalization.

InterventionsAll patients received best supportive care and, based on their clinical needs and comorbidities, specific interventions that included the main drugs being tested for repurposing to treat COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, anticoagulation, antiviral drugs, steroids or interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors.

Main outcomes and measuresClinical, laboratory and treatment characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to explore their impact on in-hospital mortality and compared with current literature data.

ResultsUnivariate analyses for clinical variables showed prognostic significance for age equal or greater than 70 years (estimated 28-days survival: 21.4 vs 67.4%; p<0.0001), presence of 2 or more relevant comorbidities (35.3 vs 61.8%; p=0.0008), ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F) less than 200 at presentation (21-days survival: 14.7 vs 52.4%;p<0.0001), high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (26.4 vs 65.3%; p=0.0001), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) values (25.4 vs 74.9%; p=0.0001), while no statistical significance was found for all the other clinical variables tested. At univariate analysis for the different treatment scheduled, prognostic significance for survival was showed for intermediate or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (estimated 28-days survival: 37.1 vs 23.4%; p=0.0001), hydroxychloroquine (35.7 vs 27.3%; p=0.0029), early antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (60.1 vs 22.4%; p<0.0001), late short-course of steroids (47.9 vs 18.2%; p<0.0001) or tocilizumab therapy (69.4 vs 29.4%; p=0.0059). Multivariable regression confirmed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age older than 70 years (odds ratio 3.26, 95% CI 1.81-5.86; p<0.0001) and showed a reduction in mortality for patients treated with anticoagulant (-0.37, 0.49-0.95; p=0.0273), antiviral (-1.22, 0.16-0.54; p<0.0001), or steroids (-0.59, 0.35-0.87; p=0.0117) therapy.

Conclusions and RelevanceResults from this real-life single-center experience are in agreement and confirm actual literature data on SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, both in terms of clinical risk factors for in-hospital mortality and as regards the effectiveness of the different therapies proposed for the management of COVID-19 disease. Waiting the results from randomized clinical trials, these data could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage and guide the choice between the different treatments implied in COVID-19 disease.

339,Dramatic Rise of Seroprevalence Rates of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies among Healthy Blood Donors: The evolution of a Pandemic,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in more than 106 million cases of confirmed infection and more than 2.3 million deaths worldwide as of February 11th 2021. Seroprevalence studies are extremely useful in studying and assessing the epidemiological status in the community and the degree of spread. They help decision makers in implementing or relaxing mitigating measures to contain the disease in addition to other benefits.

ObjectiveTo study the seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors in Jordan, at various points of time as the pandemic evolves in the community.

MethodsA total of 1374 blood donor were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 3 groups.

The first group of 746 and the second of 348 individuals were tested in June and September of 2020 respectively. The 3rd group of 292 were tested in early February of 2021. We utilized a qualitative assay that uses Electrochemiluminescence method (ECLIA) that has a specificity and sensitivity of 99.8% and 100% respectively.

ResultsThe first 2 groups representing the months of January to September of 2020, where the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases were several hundred to 3000 showed a seroprevalence rate of 0% (95% CI 0.00%, 0.51%). The 3rd group representing late January and early February 2021 when the number of reported confirmed case has reached 100 folds the numbers of September 2020, showed a seroprevalence of 27.4% (95% CI 22.5% and 32.9%).

340,"Association between SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Risk, Viral Load, and Age: A Nationwide Study in Danish Households","1AimThe objective of this observational study was to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk, RT-PCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values, and age of infected cases in Danish households.

BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic is one of the most serious global public health threats in recent times. Understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance to be able to respond to outbreaks and take action against the spread of the disease. Viral load is generally thought to correlate with transmission risk.

MethodsWe used comprehensive administrative register data from Denmark, comprising the full population and all SARS-CoV-2 tests (August 25, 2020 to February 10, 2021), to estimate household transmission risk.

ResultsWe found that the transmission risk was negatively associated--approximately linear--with the Ct values of the tested primary cases. Also, we found that even for relatively high Ct values, the risk of transmission was not negligible; e.g., for primary cases with a Ct value of 38, we found a transmission risk of 8%. This implies that there is no obvious cut-off for Ct values for risk of transmission. We estimated the transmission risk according to age and found an almost linearly increasing transmission risk with the age of the primary cases for adults ([&ge;]20 years) and negatively for children (<20 years). Age had a higher impact than Ct value on the risk of transmission.

ConclusionsLower Ct values (indicating higher viral load) are associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, even at high Ct values, transmission occurs. In addition, we found a strong association between age and transmission risk, and this dominated the Ct value association.",Frederik Plesner Lyngse; Kåre Mølbak; Kristina Træholt Franck; Claus Nielsen; Robert Leo Skov; Carsten Thure Kirkeby,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252608,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252608,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
341,COVID-19 test positivity: predictive value of various symptoms in a large community-based testing program in California,"BackgroundMuch of the early data on COVID-19 symptomatology was captured in the hospital setting. In a community setting the symptoms most predictive of SARS-CoV-2 positivity may be different. Data from the California sites of a COVID-19 community testing program are presented here.

MethodsPrior to being tested, participants in the Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program completed an online screener, in which they self-reported basic demographics and the presence or absence of 10 symptoms. Both positive and negative COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were linked back to the screener data. A multivariable model of positivity was fit using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for month of testing as a fixed effect and accounting for clustering of data within each test site.

ResultsAmong 547,018 first-time tests in California in 2020, positivity rates were 3.4%, 9.9%, and 19.8% for participants with no symptoms, 1 symptom, or 2 or more symptoms at the time of screening, respectively. All ten symptoms were individually associated with higher positivity rates, but only six of ten symptoms were associated with higher positivity when adjusting for other symptoms. Major symptoms with highest predictive value were recent loss of taste or smell, fever, and coughing with ORs of 3.27, 1.97, and 1.95, respectively. Shortness of breath and vomiting or diarrhea were negatively associated with positivity adjusting for other symptoms and, absent other symptoms, participants with these symptoms did not have significantly higher positivity rates than asymptomatic participants.

ConclusionsRecent loss of taste and smell should be elevated to a major symptom along with fever and coughing in public health messaging and in our community approach to testing and surveillance, while mild to moderate shortness of breath should be de-emphasized as a sensitive early predictor of COVID-19 positivity.",David P Miller; Scott Morrow; Robert M Califf; Cameron Kaiser; Ritu Kapur; Casimir Starsiak III; Jessica Mega; William J Marks Jr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252014,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252014,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
342,"COVID Seroprevalence, Symptoms and Mortality During the First Wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada","BackgroundEfforts to stem Canadas SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can benefit from direct understanding of the prevalence, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and information on asymptomatic infection.

MethodsWe surveyed a representative sample of 19,994 adult Canadians about COVID symptoms and analyzed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from self-collected dried blood spots (DBS) in 8,967 adults. A sensitive and specific chemiluminescence ELISA detected IgG to the spike trimer. We compared seroprevalence to deaths to establish IFRs and used mortality data to estimate infection levels in nursing home residents.

ResultsThe best estimate (high specificity) of adult seroprevalence nationally is 1.7%, but as high as 3.5% (high sensitivity) depending on assay cut-offs. The highest prevalence was in Ontario (2.4-3.9%) and in younger adults aged 18-39 years (2.5-4.4%). Based on mortality, we estimated 13-17% of nursing home residents became infected. The first viral wave infected 0.54-1.08 million adult Canadians, half of whom were <40 years old. The IFR outside nursing homes was 0.20-0.40%, but the COVID mortality rate in nursing home residents was >70 times higher than that in comparably-aged adults living in the community. Seropositivity correlated with COVID symptoms, particularly during March. Asymptomatic adults constituted about a quarter of definite seropositives, with a greater proportion in the elderly.

InterpretationCanada had relatively low infection prevalence and low IFRs in the community, but not in nursing homes, during the first viral wave. Self-collected DBS for antibody testing is a practicable strategy to monitor the ongoing second viral wave and, eventually, vaccine-induced immunity among Canadian adults.",- Action to beat coronavirus/Action pour battre le coronavirus (Ab-C) Study Investigators; Prabhat Jha,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252540,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252540,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
343,Virological and serological characterization of critically ill patient with COVID-19 in the UK: a special focus on variant detection,"BackgroundTreatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing neutralising antibody to SARS-CoV-2 is under investigation as a means of reducing viral loads, ameliorating disease outcomes, and reducing mortality. However, its efficacy might be reduced in those infected with the emerging B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. Here, we report the diverse virological characteristics of UK patients enrolled in the Immunoglobulin Domain of the REMAP-CAP randomised controlled trial.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified by real-time PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from study subjects within 48 hours of admission to intensive care unit. Antibody status was determined by spike-protein ELISA. B.1.1.7 strain was differentiated from other SARS-CoV-2 strains by two novel typing methods detecting the B.1.1.7-associated D1118H mutation with allele-specific probes and by restriction site polymorphism (SfcI).

FindingsOf 1260 subjects, 90% were PCR-positive with viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs ranging from 72 international units [IUs]/ml to 1.7x1011 IU/ml. Median viral loads were 45-fold higher in those who were seronegative for IgG antibodies (n=314; 28%) compared to seropositives (n=804; 72%), reflecting in part the latter groups possible later disease stage on enrolment. Frequencies of B.1.1.7 infection increased from early November (<1%) to December 2020 (>60%). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives (medians of 1.2x106 and 3.4 x104 IU/ml respectively; p=2x10-9). However, viral load distributions were elevated in both seropositive and seronegative subjects infected with B.1.1.7 (13.4x106 and 7.6x106 IU/ml; p=0.18).

InterpretationHigh viral loads in seropositive B.1.1.7-infected subjects are consistent with increased replication capacity and/or less effective clearance by innate or adaptive immune response of B.1.1.7 strain than wild-type. As viral genotype was associated with diverse virological and immunological phenotypes, metrics of viral load, antibody status and infecting strain should be used to define subgroups for analysis of treatment efficacy.",Jeremy Ratcliff; Dung Nguyen; Matthew Fish; Jennifer Rhynne; Aislinn Jennings; Sarah Williams; Farah Al-Beidh; David Bonsall; Nic Ciccone; Amy Evans; Tanya Golubchik; Anthony C.

344,Soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is transiently elevated in COVID-19 and correlates with specific inflammatory and endothelial markers,"RationaleAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but how SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 influences the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown.

ObjectiveTo measure circulating ACE2 and ACE levels in COVID-19 patients and investigate association with risk factors, outcome and inflammatory markers.

Methods and resultsSoluble ACE2 (sACE2) and sACE concentrations were measured by ELISA in plasma samples from 114 hospital-treated COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy controls. Follow-up samples after four months were available for 58/114 patients. Von Willebrand factor (VWF), factor VIII (fVIII), D-dimer, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor  and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) had previously been determined. Levels of sACE2 were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls, median 5.0 (interquartile range 2.8-11.8) ng/ml versus 1.4 (1.1-1.6) ng/ml, p < 0.0001. sACE2 was higher in men than women, but were not affected by other risk factors for severe COVID-19. sACE 2 decreased to 2.3 (1.6-3.9) ng/ml at follow-up, p < 0.0001, but remained higher than in healthy controls, p=0.012. Follow-up sACE2 levels were higher with increasing age, BMI, total number of comorbidities, for patients with diabetes and patients on RAS-inhibition. sACE was marginally lower during COVID-19 compared with at follow-up, 57 (45-70) ng/ml versus 72 (52-87) ng/ml, p=0.008. Levels of sACE2 and sACE did not differ depending on survival or disease severity (care level, respiratory support). sACE2 during COVID-19 correlated with VWF, fVIII and D-dimer, while sACE correlated with IL-6, TNF and PAI-1.

ConclusionssACE2 was transiently elevated in COVID-19, likely due to increased shedding from infected cells. sACE2 and sACE during COVID-19 differed distinctly in their correlations with markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting release from different cell types and/or vascular beds.",Annika Lundstrom; Louise Ziegler; Sebastian Havervall; Ann-Sofie Rudberg; Fien Von Meijenfeldt; Ton Lisman; Nigel Mackman; Per Sanden; Charlotte Thalin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252841,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252841,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
345,Redesigning SARS-CoV-2 clinical RT-qPCR assays for wastewater RT-ddPCR,"COVID-19 wastewater surveillance has gained widespread acceptance to monitor community infection trends. Wastewater samples primarily differ from clinical samples by having low viral concentrations due to dilution, and high levels of PCR inhibitors. Therefore, wastewater samples should have appropriately designed and optimized molecular assays. Digital PCR has proven to be more sensitive and resilient to matrix inhibition. However, most SARS-CoV-2 assays being used have been designed for clinical use on RT-qPCR instruments, then adopted to digital PCR platforms. But it is unknown whether clinical RT-qPCR assays are adequate to use on digital PCR platforms. Here we designed an N- and E- gene multiplex (ddCoV_N and ddCoV_E) specifically for RT-ddPCR and benchmarked them against the nCoV_N2 and E_Sarbeco assays. ddCoV_N and ddCoV_E have equivalent limits of detections and samples concentrations to NCoV_N2 and E_Sarbeco but showed improved signal-to-noise ratios that eased interpretation and ability to multiplex. From GISAID downloaded unique sequences analyzed, 2.12% and 0.83% present a mismatch or would not be detected by the used primer/probe combination for the ddCoV_N and ddCoV_E, respectively.",Raul Alexander Gonzalez; Allison Larson; Hannah Thompson; Errin Carter; Xavier Fernandez Cassi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252754,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252754,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
346,Short-stay admissions and lower staffing associated with larger COVID-19 outbreaks in Maryland nursing homes,"ObjectivesIdentify facility factors associated with a larger COVID-19 outbreak among residents in Maryland nursing homes (NHs).

DesignObservational

Setting and ParticipantsAll Maryland NHs.

MethodsResident COVID-19 cases were collected for each Maryland NH from January 1, 2020 through July 1, 2020. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence through July 1, 2020 was collected for each county and Baltimore City. Facility characteristics for each Maryland NH were collected from time periods prior to January 1, 2020. NH outbreaks were defined as larger when total resident COVID-19 cases exceeded 10% of licensed beds. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were conducted to assess the strongest predictors for the primary outcome of larger COVID-19 outbreak.

ResultsNHs located in counties with high cumulative incidence of COVID-19 were more likely to have larger outbreaks (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.3-8.7, p<0.01). NHs with at least 100 beds were more likely to have larger outbreaks, especially among facilities with >140 licensed beds (100-140 beds vs <100 beds: OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.9-4.1, p=0.09; >140 beds vs <100 beds: OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.1, p<0.01). NHs with more short-stay residents (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.8, p=0.04) or fewer Certified Nursing Assistant hours daily (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.3, p<0.01) also were more likely to have larger outbreaks. Resident race and gender were not significant predictors of larger outbreaks after adjustment for other factors.

ConclusionsLarge NHs with lower staffing levels and many short-stay residents in counties with high COVID-19 incidence were at increased risk for COVID-19 outbreaks. Understanding the characteristics of nursing homes associated with larger outbreaks can help us prepare for the next pandemic.

347,Geographic disparities in COVID-19 case rates are not reflected in seropositivity rates using a neighborhood survey in Chicago,"To date, COVID-19 case rates are disproportionately higher in Black and Latinx communities across the U.S., leading to more hospitalizations and deaths in those communities. These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with differing race/ethnicities of their residents. Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serological evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicagos first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies. Overall, these findings of comparable exposure to SARS-CoV-2 across neighborhoods with very disparate COVID-19 case rates are consistent with social determinants of health, and the comorbidities related to them, driving differences in COVID-19 rates across neighborhoods.",Brian Mustanski; Rana Saber; Daniel T.

348,"Self-reported symptoms, self-reported viral testing result and seroprevalence of SARS CoV-2 among a community sample in Essex County New Jersey: A brief report.","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has rapidly spread globally beginning in late 2019. Early areas impacted by this pandemic in the US include Essex County, New Jersey. Beyond understanding the prevalence of active infections and deaths, it is important to understand the true burden of infection in the community, as indicated by seroprevalence of antibodies directed to the virus. Understanding the spectrum of disease is key to the effectiveness of primary prevention and control measures and the design of interventions against transmission of infection.

MethodsWe utilized venue-based-sampling (VBS), implemented by a community partner, to sample members of the community in Essex County. In VBS the venues are randomized as a proxy for randomizing the attendees of the venues. We asked standard demographic questions, questions about symptoms and PCR testing and previous antibody testing. Participants provide a blood sample collected by finger stick with the Neoteryx Mitra Collection device. Samples were tested using a novel ELISA based approached developed by our team.

ResultsFrom September 15, 2020 to December 22, 2020, we conducted 92 randomly selected sampling events where we approached 1349 individuals for screening. Of these, 924 consented and had complete data for analysis. Only 6.5% of the sample reported any COVID-19 like symptoms while 45.9% had sought out a COVID-19 test. In total 13 (1.4%) participants received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result. While 33 participants (2.6%) sought a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, only 0.5% of the sample reported a positive antibody result. Testing in this study identified 83 (9.0%) participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

ConclusionWe recruited a large sample of the population of Essex County, New Jersey using VBS, electronic surveys, novel sample collection and lab methods. Our findings suggest that the burden of SARS-Cov-2 is slightly more than six times than that suggested by PCR testing. This burden is higher than most estimates obtained through studies of remnant blood samples from hospitals (4.2%), samples from staff at a public-school system (2.9%), and residents of a California county recruited with targeted Facebook ads (1.5%). (9-11) Moreover, with only 6.5% of the sample reporting any COVID-19-like symptoms, our finding suggests that the number of asymptomatic persons may be close to 1.5 times greater than anyone reporting symptoms.",Henry F Raymond; Pratik Datta; Rahul Ukey; Peng Wang; Richard J Martino; Kristen D Krause; Corey Rosmarin-DeStefano; Abraham Pinter; Perry N Halkitis; Maria L Gennaro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252766,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252766,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
349,Sharing positive changes made during COVID-19 national lockdown: a multi-method co-production study,"ObjectiveA multi-method co-production study was designed to share psychosocial insights into the adoption of positive changes made during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. We examined: i) the psychosocial patterning of positive changes, ii) the psychosocial processes by which positive change was realised, and worked with partner organizations to share our insights.

MethodsA sequential multi-method design included an online survey (n=2445) assessing positive changes in sleep and physical activity patterns, socio-demographics, mood, social support, coping, and resilience, with multivariate logistic regression analysis. We also employed interviews with a purposive diverse sub-sample of people self-reporting high levels of positive change (n=48) and used thematic analysis. Finally, partnership work translated insights into positive change-sharing targeted resources.

ResultsThe survey identified positive change was significantly patterned by age, gender and vulnerability to COVID-19. Higher positive reframing and higher active coping were associated with higher levels of cross-domain positive change. Higher symptoms of depression, planning, and self-distraction were associated with less cross-domain positive change. Thematic analysis showed the centrality of perceptions of time, opportunities to self-reflect and engage with the natural world, access support in diverse ways, actively build routine and purposefully build self-efficacy and a sense of control were key to initiating positive change. Our partner organizations focused on the rapid co-production of a series of online resources that shared study insights.

350,Schooling amidst a pandemic: parents' perceptions about reopening schools and anticipated challenges during COVID-19,"IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous states in the United States instituted measures to close schools or shift them to virtual platforms. Understanding parents preferences for sending their children back to school, and their experiences with distance learning is critical for informing school reopening guidelines. This study characterizes parents plans to send their children to school, and examines the challenges associated with school closures during the 2020-2021 academic year.

MethodsA national-level cross-sectional online survey was conducted in September 2020. Focusing on a subset of 510 respondents, who were parents of school-aged children, we examined variations in parents plans for their children to return to school by their demographic and family characteristics, and challenges they anticipated during the school-year using multivariable logistic regressions.

ResultsFifty percent of respondents (n=249) said that they would send their children back to school, 18% (n=92) stated it would depend on what the district plans for school reopening, and 32% (n=160) would not send their children back to school. No demographic characteristics were significantly associated with parents plans to not return their children to school. Overall, parents reported high-level of access to digital technology to support their childs learning needs (84%). However, those who reported challenges with distance learning due to a lack of childcare were less likely not to return their children to school (aOR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64). Parents who reported requiring supervision after school had higher odds of having plans to not return their children to school (aOR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.79). Parents viewed COVID-19 vaccines and face masks important for resuming in-person classes.

351,Comparing Vaccination Strategies in Canada Under Different Assumptions,"This paper estimates the outcomes of two different COVID-19 vaccination strategies in Canada for the mRNA vaccines currently approved for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), modelled on the vaccination and effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine which is likely to be more widely administered in Canada. The first strategy is the manufacturer recommended standard of two doses (two-dose strategy) given within 21 days apart versus a strategy of giving a larger group a single dose of vaccine (first-dose-for-most strategy) by delaying the second injection.

Three parameters are varied in the course of 36 estimation scenarios of the population-level effects of the two vaccination strategies. The first is the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine at preventing disease, the second is the effectiveness of the vaccine at preventing transmission of the virus, and the third is the rate of transmission of the virus during the course of the simulations.

Over the course of the different scenarios, the first-dose-for-most strategy was superior in reducing disease transmission in all scenarios where vaccination is assumed to have an effect on viral transmission. The results for fatalities was mixed, with the first-dose-for-most strategy being superior in cases where a higher first-dose effectiveness at preventing disease was assumed.

Finally, in the best-guess scenarios where a 75% reduction in disease transmission and a 92.6% effectiveness at preventing disease from a single dose were used, the first-dose-for-most strategy was superior in a situation with reduced vaccine doses available, and switching to the first-dose-for-most strategy earlier helped to prevent a higher proportion of cases and deaths.",Timothy Ruse,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252761,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252761,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
352,Covid-19 impact on Parkinson's Disease patients treated by drugs or deep brain stimulation,"PurposeCovid-19 has affected all people, especially those with chronic diseases, including Parkinsons Disease (PD). Covid-19 may affect both motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients. We intend to evaluate different aspects of Covid-19 impact on PD patients.

Methods647 PD patients were evaluated in terms of PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical presentations in addition to past medical history during the pandemic through an online questioner. They were compared with an age-matched control group consist of 673 individuals and a sample of the normal population consist of 1215 individuals.

ResultsThe prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was 11.28%. The mortality was 1.23% among PD patients. The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who undergone DBS was 18.18%. No significant association was found between the duration of disease and the prevalence of Covid-19. A statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals was found. No statistically significant association has been found between the worsening of motor symptoms and Covid-19. PD patients and the normal population may differ in the prevalence of some psychological disorders, including anxiety and sleeping disorders, and Covid-19 may affect the psychological status.

ConclusionPD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols, which lead to lower prevalence and severity of Covid-19 and its consequences in these patients. Although it seems Covid-19 does not affect motor and psychological aspects of PD as much as it was expected, more accurate evaluations are suggested in order to clarify such effects.",Mehri Salari; Masoud Etemadifar; Alireza Zali; Zahra Aminzade; Parsa Farsinejad; Sepand Tehrani Fateh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252464,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252464,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
353,Economic Benefits of COVID-19 Screening Tests with a Vaccine Rollout,"This note estimates the costs and benefits of a nationwide COVID-19 screening testing program in the presence of vaccine distribution. Even for an optimistic vaccine rollout scenario, a well-designed federally-funded screening testing program, coupled with self-isolation of those who test positive, pays for itself in terms of increased GDP and is projected to save 20,000 or more lives. The sooner the testing program is put in place, the greater are its net economic benefits.

354,An Explainable Artificial Intelligence based Prospective Framework for COVID-19 Risk Prediction,"Given the spread of COVID-19 to vast geographical regions and populations, it is not feasible to undergo or recommend the RT-PCR based tests to all individuals with flu-like symptoms. The reach of RT-PCR based testing is still limited due to the high cost of the test and huge population in few countries. Thus, alternative methods for COVID-19 infection risk prediction can be useful. We built an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) based integrated web-based prospective framework for COVID-19 risk prediction. We employed a two-step procedure for the non-clinical prediction of COVID19 infection risk. In the first step we assess the initial risk of COVID19 infection based on carefully selected parameters associated with COVID-19 positive symptoms from recent research. Generally, X-ray scans are cheaper and easily available in most government and private health centres. Therefore, based on the outcome of the computed initial risk in first step, we further provide an optional prediction using the chest X-ray scans in the second step of our proposed AI based prospective framework. Since there is a bottleneck to undergo an expensive RT-PCR based confirmatory test in economically backward nations, this is a crucial part of our explainable AI based prospective framework. The initial risk assessment outcome is analysed in combination with the advanced deep learning-based analysis of chest X-ray scans to provide an accurate prediction of COVID-19 infection risk. This prospective web-based AI framework can be employed in limited resource settings after clinical validation in future. The cost and time associated with the adoption of this prospective AI based prospective framework will be minimal and hence it will be beneficial to majority of the population living in low-income settings such as small towns and rural areas that have limited access to advanced healthcare facilities.",Vishal Sharma; Piyush; Samarth Chhatwal; Bipin Singh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252269,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252269,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
355,"Evaluation of accuracy, exclusivity, limit-of-detection and ease-of-use of LumiraDx™ - Antigen-detecting point-of-care device for SARS-CoV-2","BackgroundRapid antigen-detecting tests (Ag-RDTs) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can transform pandemic control. Thus far, sensitivity ([&le;]85%) of lateral-flow assays has limited scale-up. Conceivably, microfluidic immunofluorescence Ag-RDTs could increase sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Materials and MethodsThis multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study investigated performance of the microfluidic immunofluorescence LumiraDx assay, enrolling symptomatic and asymptomatic participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants collected a supervised nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) self-swab for Ag-RDT testing, in addition to a professionally-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for routine testing with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results were compared to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Sub-analyses investigated the results by viral load, symptom presence and duration. An analytical study assessed exclusivity and limit-of-detection (LOD). In addition, we evaluated ease-of-use.

ResultsStudy conduct was between November 2nd 2020 and January 21st 2021. 761 participants were enrolled, with 486 participants reporting symptoms on testing day. 120 out of 146 RT-PCR positive cases were detected positive by LumiraDx, resulting in a sensitivity of 82.2% (95% CI: 75.2%-87.5%). Specificity was 99.3% (CI: 98.3-99.7%). Sensitivity was increased in individuals with viral load [&ge;] 7 log10 SARS-CoV2 RNA copies/ml (93.8%; CI: 86.2%-97.3%). Testing against common respiratory commensals and pathogens showed no cross-reactivity and LOD was estimated to be 2-56 PFU/mL. The ease-of-use-assessment was favourable for lower throughput settings.

357,"Efficacy of Nitazoxanide in reducing the viral load in COVID-19 patients. Randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded, parallel group, pilot study.","The fast spread of COVID-19 has overcrowded Public Health Systems facilities in major countries due to the large number of seriously ill patients, particularly those requiring admission to intensive care units. Reducing viral load, along with other recommended epidemiological measures, such as social distancing and home confinement, can in time significantly help to reduce the infection R0 (Basic Reproductive Rate) and then mitigate disease burden. Early negativization or otherwise reduction of the viral load can potentially diminish disease severity, resulting in a better-controlled public health response, avoiding collapse of healthcare systems. Nitazoxanide, a widely used thiazolide approved by the FDA as an antiparasitic drug, also approved in Brazil for Norovirus and Rotavirus treatments, has an excellent safety record for a variety of indications. Nitazoxanide exhibits activity in vitro against MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses; and a specific antiviral effect (in micro molar doses) against SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nitazoxanide in reducing the SARS-COV 2 viral load within 7 days of treatment in respiratory samples from COVID-19-infected patients with mild to moderate disease, compared to placebo. An interim analysis showed that the ratio of patients with a viral load reduction [&ge;] 35% from baseline up to day 7 of treatment was significantly greater for Nitazoxanide compared to placebo (47.8% vs. 15.4%; {Delta} 34.6%; 95% CI: 64.7; 4.6: p = 0.037).

359,HiSpike: A high-throughput cost effective sequencing method for the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene,"The changing nature of the corona virus of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to the worlds health systems. New and virulent emerging spike gene variants, such as the UK 20I/501Y.V1 and South African 20H/501Y.V2, could jeopardize global efforts to produce immunity and reduce mortality. These challenges require effective real-time genomic surveillance solutions that the medical community can quickly adopt. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host receptor recognition and entry into the cell and therefore, it is most susceptible to generation of variants with increased transmissibility and pathogenicity. The spike protein is also the primary target of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients and the most common antigen for induction of effective vaccine immunity. Therefore, tight monitoring of the spike protein gene variants is key to mitigating COVID-19 spread and vaccine escape mutants. Currently, the ARTIC method for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is applied worldwide. However, this method commonly requires more than 96 hours (4-5 days) from start to finish and at present high sample sequence demands, sequencing resources are quickly exhausted. In this work, we present HiSpike, a method for high-throughput targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of the spike gene. This simple three-step method can be completed in less than 30 hours and can sequence 10-fold more samples compared to the conventional ARTIC method and at a fraction of the cost. HiSpike was proven valid, and has identified, at high quality, multiple spike variants from real-time field samples, such as the UK and the South African variants. This method will certainly be effective in discovering future spike mutations. Therefore, running HiSpike for full sequencing of the spike gene of all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples could be considered for near real-time detection of known and emerging spike mutations as they evolve. HiSpike provides affordable sequencing options to help laboratories conserve resources, hence it provides a tool for widespread monitoring, that can support critical knowledge-based decisions.",Ephraim Fass; Gal Zizelski Valenci; Mor Rubinstein; Paul Jeffrey Freidlin; Shira Rosencwaig; Ina Kutikov; Robert Werner; Nofar Ben-Tovim; Efrat Bucris; Neta S Zuckerman; Orna Mor; Ella Mendelson; Zeev Dveyrin; Efrat Rorman; Israel Nissan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252290,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252290,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True

We systematically evaluated diagnostic yield across different sample collection and transport workflows, including the incorporation of a viral inactivation buffer. We prospectively collected nasal swabs, oral swabs, and saliva, from 52 COVID-19 RT-PCR-confirmed patients, and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 37 patients. Nasal and oral swabs were placed in both viral transport media (VTM) and eNAT, a sterilizing transport buffer, prior to testing with the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test. The sensitivity of each sampling strategy was compared using a composite positive standard. Overall, swab specimens collected in eNAT showed superior sensitivity compared to swabs in VTM (70% vs 57%, P=0.0022). Direct saliva 90.5%, (95% CI: 82%, 95%), followed by NP swabs in VTM and saliva in eNAT, was significantly more sensitive than nasal swabs in VTM (50%, P<0.001) or eNAT (67.8%, P=0.0012) and oral swabs in VTM (50%, P<0.0001) or eNAT (56%, P<0.0001).

It contains a constellation of mutations, ten of them in the spike protein. Consequences of these mutations at the populational level have been little studied so far. From December-2020 to February-2021, Manaus was devastated by four times more cases compared to the previous peak (April-2020). Here, data from the national health surveillance of hospitalized individuals and frequency of the P.1 variant were analysed using a model-based approach to estimate P.1 parameters of transmissibility and reinfection by maximum likelihood. Sensitivity analysis was performed changing pathogenicity and the period analysed (including/excluding the health system collapse period). The new variant transmissibility was found to be about 2.5 times higher (Confidence Interval (95%CI): 2.3-2.8) compared to the previous variant in Manaus. A low probability of reinfection by the new variant (6.4%, 95%CI: 5.7-7.1%).) was estimated, even under initial high prevalence (68%, 95%CI: 63- 74%), by the time P.1 emerged.

Globally, quarantine and outbreak management measures have been implemented to stem the introduction of these variants and to monitor any emerging variants of potential clinical significance domestically. Here, we describe the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage, mainly from the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. This emergent variant is characterized by 13 lineage-defining mutations, including the co-occurrence of the E484K, N501Y, and P681H mutations at the spike protein region, as well as three additional radical amino acid replacements towards the C-terminal end of the said protein. A three-amino acid deletion at positions 141 to 143 (LGV141_143del) in the spike protein was likewise seen in a region preceding the 144Y deletion found in the B.1.1.7 variant. A single amino acid replacement, K2Q, at the N-terminus of ORF8 was also shared by all 33 samples sequenced. The mutation profile of this new virus variant warrants closer investigation due to its potential public health implications.

364,Real World Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Various Clinical Settings,"BackgroundSeveral uses of Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) have been suggested. Analytical studies reported high specificity yet with lower sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared to qRT-PCR. Here, we present the use of these tests as a decision support tool in several settings.

MethodsSamples were collected for both Ag-RDT and qRT-PCR in three different clinical settings; 1. Symptomatic patients presenting at the Emergency Departments 2. Asymptomatic patients screened upon hospitalization and 3. Health-care workers (HCW) following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. To estimate the association between Ct value, Ag-RDT and the number of days since SARS-CoV-2 exposure or symptomatic COVID-19, a mixed model was applied.

ResultsA total of 5172 samples were obtained from 4595 individuals, with Ag-RDT and qRT-PCR results. Of these, 485 samples were positive by qRT-PCR. The PPA of Ag-RDT was greater for lower Ct values, reaching 93% in cases where Ct value was lower than 25 and 85% where Ct value was lower than 30. PPA was similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The NPV and PPV were 96.8% and 99.1%, respectively. We observed a significant correlation between Ct value and time from infection onset (p<0.001). Lower Ct values were significantly associated with a positive Ag-RDT (p=0.01).

365,An upsurge of SARS CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Variant in Pakistan,"The emergence of a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B1.1.7) in the United Kingdom (UK) during late 2020 has raised major public health concerns. Several mutations have been reported in the genome of the B.1.1.7 variant including the N501Y and 69-70deletion in the Spike that has implications on virus transmissibility and diagnostics. Although the B.1.1.7 variant has been reported from several countries, only two cases have been identified through whole-genome sequencing from Pakistan. We used a two-step strategy for the detection of B.1.1.7 with initial screening through ThermoFisher TaqPath SARS-CoV-2 kit followed by partial sequencing of Spike (S) gene of samples having spike gene target failure (SGTF) on real-time PCR. From January 01, 2021, to February 21, 2021, a total of 2,650 samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using TaqPath kit and 70.4% (n=1,867) showed amplification of all the 3 genes (S, N, and ORF). Notably, 29.6% (n=783) samples had the spike gene target failure (SGTF). The SGTF cases were detected at a low frequency during the first three weeks of January (n=10, n=13, and n=1 respectively) however, the cases started to increase in the last week. During February, 726 (93%) cases of SGTF was reported with a peak (n=345) found during the 3rd week. Based on the partial sequencing of spike gene of SGTF samples (n=15), 93% (n=14) showed the characteristic N501Y, A570D, P681H, and T716I mutations found in the B.1.1.7 variant.

By simplifying the analytical process and cross-contamination risks, RT-RC-PCR presents disruptive scalability and economy while using NGS and LIMS infrastructure widely available across health service, institutional and commercial laboratories.

We present a validation of RT-RC-PCR for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by NGS. The limit of detection is comparable to real-time RT-PCR, and no obvious difference in sensitivity was detected between extracted nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) RNA and native saliva samples.

The end point measurement of RT-RC-PCR is NGS of amplified sequences within the SARS-CoV-2 genome; we demonstrated its capacity to detect different variants using amplicons containing delH69-V70 and N501Y, both of which emerged in the UK Variant of Concern B.1.1.7 in 2020.

367,Characterizing all-cause excess mortality patterns during COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico,"BackgroundThe low testing rates, compounded by reporting delays, hinders the estimation of the mortality burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic based on surveillance data alone. A more reliable picture of the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mortality can be derived by estimating excess deaths above an expected level of death. In this study we aim to estimate the absolute and relative mortality impact of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in 2020 by gender and two geographic regions: Mexico City and the rest of the country.

MethodsWe obtained mortality time series due to all causes for Mexico, and by gender, and geographic region using epidemiological weeks from January to December 2020 and for preceding 5 years. We also compiled data on COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality to assess the timing and intensity of the pandemic in Mexico. We assembled weekly series of the number of tweets about  death from Mexico to assess the correlation between peoples media interaction about  death and the rise in pandemic deaths. We estimated all-cause excess mortality rates and mortality rate ratio increase over baseline by fitting Serfling regression models.

ResultsThe COVID-19 pandemic excess mortality rates per 10,000 population in Mexico between March 1, 2020 and January 2, 2021 was estimated at 26.10. The observed total number of deaths due to COVID-19 was 128,886 which is 38.64% of the total estimated excess deaths. Males had about 2-fold higher excess mortality rate (33.99) compared to females (18.53). The excess mortality rate for Mexico City (63.54) was about 2.7-fold higher than the rest of the country (23.25). Similarly, the mortality rate ratio relative to baseline was highest for Mexico City (RR: 2.09). There was no significant correlation between weekly number of tweets on  death and the weekly all-cause excess mortality rates ({rho}=0.309 (95% CI: 0.010, 0.558, p-value=0.043).

ConclusionThe excess mortality rate of 26.10 per 10,000 population corresponds to a total of 333,538 excess deaths in Mexico between March 1, 2020 to January 2, 2021. COVID-19 accounted for only 38.21% of the total excess deaths, which reflects either the effect of low testing rates in Mexico, or the surge in number of deaths due to other causes.",Sushma Dahal; Juan M.

368,The emergence and ongoing convergent evolution of the N501Y lineages coincides with a major global shift in the SARS-CoV-2 selective landscape,"The emergence and rapid rise in prevalence of three independent SARS-CoV-2 ""501Y lineages, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, in the last three months of 2020 has prompted renewed concerns about the evolutionary capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to adapt to both rising population immunity, and public health interventions such as vaccines and social distancing. Viruses giving rise to the different 501Y lineages have, presumably under intense natural selection following a shift in host environment, independently acquired multiple unique and convergent mutations. As a consequence all have gained epidemiological and immunological properties that will likely complicate the control of COVID-19. Here, by examining patterns of mutations that arose in SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the pandemic we find evidence of a major change in the selective forces acting on immunologically important SARS-CoV-2 genes (such as N and S) that likely coincided with the emergence of the 501Y lineages. In addition to involving continuing sequence diversification, we find evidence that a significant portion of the ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further convergence between the lineages. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring how members of these known 501Y lineages, and others still undiscovered, are convergently evolving similar strategies to ensure their persistence in the face of mounting infection and vaccine induced host immune recognition.",Darren P Martin; Steven Weaver; Houryiah Tegally; Emmanuel James San; Stephen D Shank; Eduan Wilkinson; Jennifer Giandhari; Sureshnee Naidoo; Yeshnee Pillay; Lavanya Singh; Richard J Lessells; - NGS-SA Consortium; - COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium; Ravindra K Gupta; Joel O Wertheim; Anton Nekturenko; Ben Murrell; Gordon W Harkins; Philippe Lemey; Oscar MacLean; David L Robertson; Tulio de Oliveira; Sergei L Kosakovsky Pond,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252268,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252268,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
369,SWIFT: A Deep Learning Approach to Prediction of Hypoxemic Events in Critically-Ill Patients Using SpO2 Waveform Prediction,"Hypoxemia is a significant driver of mortality and poor clinical outcomes in conditions such as brain injury and cardiac arrest in critically ill patients, including COVID-19 patients. Given the host of negative clinical outcomes attributed to hypoxemia, identifying patients likely to experience hypoxemia would offer valuable opportunities for early and thus more effective intervention. We present SWIFT (SpO2 Waveform ICU Forecasting Technique), a deep learning model that predicts blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) waveforms 5 and 30 minutes in the future using only prior SpO2 values as inputs. When tested on novel data, SWIFT predicts more than 80% and 60% of hypoxemic events in critically ill and COVID-19 patients, respectively. SWIFT also predicts SpO2 waveforms with average MSE below .0007. SWIFT provides information on both occurrence and magnitude of potential hypoxemic events 30 minutes in advance, allowing it to be used to inform clinical interventions, patient triaging, and optimal resource allocation. SWIFT may be used in clinical decision support systems to inform the management of critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",Akshaya V Annapragada; Joseph L Greenstein; Sanjukta N Bose; Bradford D Winters; Sridevi V Sarma; Raimond L Winslow,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252234,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252234,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True

We report here the spillover of mink-adapted SARS-CoV-2 from farmed mink to humans after extensive adaptation that lasted at least 3 months.

371,Molecular strategies for antibody binding and escape of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations,"The COVID19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 100 million people worldwide. Due to the rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact, it is paramount to find effective treatments against it. Human neutralizing antibodies are an effective method to fight viral infection. However, the recent discovery of new strains that substantially change the S-protein sequence has raised concern about vaccines and antibodies effectiveness. Here, we investigated the binding mechanisms between the S-protein and several antibodies. Multiple mutations were included to understand the strategies for antibody escape in new variants. We found that the combination of mutations K417N and E484K produced higher binding energy to ACE2 than the wild type, suggesting higher efficiency to enter host cells. The mutations effect depends on the antibody class. While Class I enhances the binding avidity in the presence of N501Y mutation, class II antibodies showed a sharp decline in the binding affinity. Our simulations suggest that Class I antibodies will remain effective against the new strains. In contrast, Class II antibodies will have less affinity to the S-protein, potentially affecting these antibodies efficiency.",Mohamed Hendy; Samuel Kaufman; Mauricio Ponga,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433970,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433970,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,False
372,Modeling transmission dynamics and effectiveness of worker screening programs for SARS-CoV-2 in pork processing plants,"Pork processing plants were apparent hotspots for SARS-CoV2 in the spring of 2020. As a result, the swine industry was confronted with a major occupational health, financial, and animal welfare crisis. The objective of this work was to describe the epidemiological situation within processing plants, develop mathematical models to simulate transmission in these plants, and test the effectiveness of routine PCR screening at minimizing SARS-CoV2 circulation. Cumulative incidence of clinical (PCR-confirmed) disease plateaued at [~]2.5% to 25% across the three plants studied here. For larger outbreaks, antibody prevalence was approximately 30% to 40%. Secondly, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and background ""community"" transmission. By calibrating this model to observed epidemiological data, we estimated the initial reproduction number (R) of the virus. Across plants, R generally ranged between 2 and 4 during the initial phase, but subsequently declined to [~]1 after two to three weeks, most likely as a result of implementation/compliance with biosecurity measures in combination with population immunity. Using the calibrated model to simulate a range of possible scenarios, we show that the effectiveness of routine PCR-screening at minimizing disease spread was far more influenced by testing frequency than by delays in results, R, or background community transmission rates. Testing every three days generally averted about 25% to 40% of clinical cases across a range of assumptions, while testing every 14 days typically averted 7 to 13% of clinical cases. However, the absolute number of additional clinical cases expected and averted was influenced by whether there was residual immunity from a previous peak (i.e., routine testing is implemented after the workforce had experienced an initial outbreak). In contrast, when using PCR-screening to prevent outbreaks or in the early stages of an outbreak, even frequent testing may not prevent a large outbreak within the workforce. This research helps to identify protocols that minimize risk to occupational safety and health and support continuity of business for U.S. processing plants. While the model was calibrated to meat processing plants, the structure of the model and insights about testing are generalizable to other settings where large number of people work in close proximity.",Kimberly VanderWaal; Lora Black; Judy Hodge; Addisalem Bedada; Scott Dee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21249552,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21249552,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True
373,A Two-Sample Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization Method Accounting for Linkage Disequilibrium and Idiosyncratic Pleiotropy With Applications to the COVID-19 Outcome,"Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical method exploiting genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of modifiable risk factors on an outcome of interest. Despite wide uses of various popular two-sample MR methods based on genome-wide association study summary level data, however, those methods could suffer from potential power loss or/and biased inference when the chosen genetic variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD), and have relatively large direct effects on the outcome whose distribution might be heavy-tailed which is commonly referred to as the idiosyncratic pleiotropy. To resolve those two issues, we propose a novel Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization (RBMR) model that uses the more robust multivariate generalized t-distribution (Arellano-Valle and Bolfarine, 1995) to model such direct effects in a probabilistic model framework which can also incorporate the LD structure explicitly. The generalized t-distribution can be represented as a Gaussian scaled mixture so that our model parameters can be estimated by the EM-type algorithms. We compute the standard errors by calibrating the evidence lower bound (ELBO) using the likelihood ratio test. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our RBMR has robust performance compared to other competing methods. We also apply our RBMR method to two benchmark data sets and find that RBMR has smaller bias and standard errors. Using our proposed RBMR method, we found that coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We also develop a user-friendly R package RBMR (https://github.com/AnqiWang2021/RBMR) for public use.",Anqi Wang; Zhonghua Liu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252801,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252801,2021-03-05,2021-03-05,,True

Computational analysis of its amino acid sequence reveals a central low-complexity domain (LCD) having sequence features akin to LCDs in other proteins known to function in liquid-liquid phase separation. Here we show that in the presence of viral RNA, NCAP, and also its LCD segment alone, form amyloid-like fibrils when undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation. Within the LCD we identified three 6-residue segments that drive amyloid fibril formation. We determined atomic structures for fibrils formed by each of the three identified segments. These structures informed our design of peptide inhibitors of NCAP fibril formation and liquid-liquid phase separation, suggesting a therapeutic route for Covid-19.

Our data show that parameters of natural infection (time from infection and infecting variant) determined cross-neutralization. Importantly, upon vaccination, previously infected individuals developed equivalent B.1.1.7 and Wuhan neutralizing responses. In contrast, uninfected vaccinees showed reduced neutralization against B.1.1.7.

377,"Scent dog identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections, similar across different body fluids","BackgroundThe main strategy to contain the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remains to implement a comprehensive testing, tracing and quarantining strategy until vaccination of the population is adequate.

MethodsTen dogs were trained to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in beta-propiolactone inactivated saliva samples. The subsequent cognitive transfer performance for the recognition of non-inactivated samples were tested on saliva, urine, and sweat in a randomised, double-blind controlled study.

ResultsDogs were tested on a total of 5242 randomised sample presentations. Dogs detected non-inactivated saliva samples with a diagnostic sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 95%. In a subsequent experiment to compare the scent recognition between the three non-inactivated body fluids, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 98% for urine, 91% and 94% for sweat, 82%, and 96% for saliva respectively.

ConclusionsThe scent cognitive transfer performance between inactivated and non-inactivated samples as well as between different sample materials indicates that global, specific SARS-CoV-2-associated volatile compounds are released across different body secretions, independently from the patients symptoms.

378,Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Mutations Over Time Reveals Increasing Prevalence of Variants in the Spike Protein and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly important to monitor the mutations that arise in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to prepare public health strategies and guide the further development of vaccines and therapeutics. The spike (S) protein and the proteins comprising the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) are key vaccine and drug targets, respectively, making mutation surveillance of these proteins of great importance.

Full protein sequences for the spike proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins were downloaded from the GISAID database, aligned, and the variants identified. Polymorphisms in the protein sequence were investigated at the protein structural level and examined longitudinally in order to identify sequence and strain variants that are emerging over time. Our analysis revealed a group of variants in the spike protein and the polymerase complex that appeared in August, and account for around five percent of the genomes analyzed up to the last week of October. A structural analysis also facilitated investigation of several unique variants in the receptor binding domain and the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, with high-frequency mutations occurring more commonly in these regions.

To address the need for a high-quality neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2, a previously established fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was modified and optimized. The SARS-CoV-2 FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus variants.

High frequency of somatic integration of the RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the DNA of infected cells was recently suggested, partly based on the detection of chimeric RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from human host DNA. Here, we examined the possible origin of human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads in RNA-seq libraries and provide alternative explanations for their origin. Chimeric reads were frequently detected also between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from mitochondrial DNA or episomal adenoviral DNA present in transfected cell lines, which was unlikely the result of SARS-CoV-2 integration. Furthermore, chimeric reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from nuclear DNA was highly enriched for host exonic, than intronic or intergenic sequences and often involved the same, highly expressed host genes.

Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to severe with, so far, minimal genotypic change to the virus so understanding the host response is paramount. Transcriptomics has become incredibly important in understanding host-pathogen interactions; however, post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in infection and immunity through translation and mRNA stability, allowing tight control over potent host responses by both the host and the invading virus. Here we apply ribosome profiling to assess post-transcriptional regulation of host genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3). We have identified numerous transcription factors (JUN, ZBTB20, ATF3, HIVEP2 and EGR1) as well as select antiviral cytokine genes, namely IFNB1, IFNL1,2 and 3, IL-6 and CCL5, that are restricted at the post-transcriptional level by SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss the impact this would have on the host response to infection.

383,Saliva testing is accurate for early-stage and presymptomatic COVID-19,"BackgroundAlthough nasopharyngeal (NP) samples have been considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, variability in viral load across different anatomical sites could theoretically cause NP samples to be less sensitive than saliva or nasal samples in certain cases. Self-collected samples also have logistical advantages over NP samples, making them amenable to population-scale screening.

MethodsTo evaluate sampling alternatives for population screening, we collected NP, saliva, and nasal samples from two cohorts with varied levels and types of symptoms.

ResultsIn a mixed cohort of 60 symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, we found that saliva had 88% concordance with NP when tested in the same testing lab (n = 41), and 68% concordance when tested in different testing labs (n = 19). In a second cohort of 20 participants hospitalized for COVID-19, saliva had 74% concordance with NP tested in the same testing lab, but detected virus in two participants that tested negative with NP on the same day. Medical record review showed that the saliva-based testing sensitivity was related to the timing of symptom onset and disease stage.

ConclusionsWe find that no sample site will be perfectly sensitive for COVID-19 testing in all situations, and the significance of negative results will always need to be determined in the context of clinical signs and symptoms. Saliva retained high clinical sensitivity while allowing easier collection, minimizing the exposure of healthcare workers and need for personal protective equipment, and making it a viable option for population-scale testing.",Abigail J Johnson; Shannon Zhou; Susan L Hoops; Benjamin Hillmann; Matthew Schomaker; Robyn Kincaid; Jerry Daniel; Kenneth Beckman; Daryl M Gohl; Sophia Yohe; Dan Knights; Andrew C Nelson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252830,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252830,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,True

However, reactogenicity, such as fever, caused by innate immune responses to the vaccine formulation remains to be improved. Here, we optimized a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccine candidate, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (LNP-mRNA-RBD), which showed improved immunogenicity by removing reactogenic materials from the vaccine formulation and protective potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques. LNP-mRNA-RBD induced robust antigen-specific B cells and follicular helper T cells in the BALB/c strain but not in the C57BL/6 strain; the two strains have contrasting abilities to induce type I interferon production by dendritic cells. Removal of reactogenic materials from original synthesized mRNA by HPLC reduced type I interferon (IFN) production by dendritic cells, which improved immunogenicity. Immunization of cynomolgus macaques with an LNP encapsulating HPLC-purified mRNA induced robust anti-RBD IgG in the plasma and in various mucosal areas, including airways, thereby conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Using Biolayer Interferometry, we analyzed the binding of this mutant to ACE2, and the susceptibility to neutralization by sera from vaccinated mice and COVID-19 convalescent patients.

ResultsKinetic profiles showed increased RBDmut - ACE2 affinity compared to RBDwt, and binding of vaccine-elicited or convalescent sera was significantly reduced. Likewise, both sera types showed significantly reduced ability to block RBDmut - ACE2 binding indicating that antibodies induced by RBDwt have reduced capability to neutralize mutant virus.

ConclusionOur physiochemical data show enhanced infectivity and reduced neutralization by polyclonal antibodies of the Brazilian variant of SARS-CoV-2.

387,The mRNA-LNP platform's lipid nanoparticle component used in preclinical vaccine studies is highly inflammatory,"Vaccines based on mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a promising new platform used by two leading vaccines against coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations present with very high protection levels and varying degrees of side effects. However, the nature of the reported side effects remains poorly defined. Here we present evidence that LNPs used in many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal injection of these LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate.

In summary, here we show that the LNPs used for many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory. Thus, their potent adjuvant activity and reported superiority comparing to other adjuvants in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses could stem from their inflammatory nature. Furthermore, the preclinical LNPs are similar to the ones used for human vaccines, which could also explain the observed side effects in humans using this platform.",Sonia Ndeupen; Zhen Qin; Sonya Jacobsen; Matthew Gibb; Henri Estanbouli; Aurelie Bouteau; Jacob Cardenas; Balaji Uthra; Yuanyuan Wang; Jinghua Gu; Botond Z Igyarto,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.430128,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.430128,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,False

389,Efficient Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Using Chimeric Antisense Oligonucleotides through RNase L Activation,"There is an urgent need for effective antiviral drugs to alleviate the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we rationally designed and developed chimeric antisense oligonucleotides to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS-CoV-2. Each oligonucleotide comprises a 3 antisense sequence for target recognition and a 5-phosphorylated 2-5 poly(A)4 for guided ribonuclease L (RNase L) activation. Since RNase L can potently cleave single strand RNA during innate antiviral response, the improved degradation efficiency of chimeric oligonucleotides was twice as much as classic antisense oligonucleotides in Vero cells, for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, one of chimeric oligonucleotides targeting spike RNA achieved potent and broad-spectrum inhibition of both SARS-CoV-2 and its recently reported N501Y and/or {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 mutants. These results showed that the constructed chimeric oligonucleotides could efficiently degrade pathogenic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 facilitated by immune activation, showing promising potentials as antiviral nucleic acid drugs for COVID-19.",Xiaoxuan Su; Wenxiao Ma; Boyang Cheng; Qian Wang; Demin Zhou; Xinjing Tang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433849,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433849,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,False
390,"Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by suppressing its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, via aryl-hydrocarbon receptor signal","Since understanding molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely important for developing effective therapies against COVID-19, we focused on the internalization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 via ACE2. Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists, including CSE, FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.",Keiji Tanimoto; Kiichi Hirota; Takahiro Fukazawa; Yoshiyuki Matsuo; Toshihito Nomura; Nazmul Tanuza; Nobuyuki Hirohashi; Hidemasa Bono; Takemasa Sakakuchi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433658,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433658,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,False

We show that the oxyanion loop, involved in substrate recognition and enzymatic activity, can adopt a new conformation, which is stable and significantly different from the known ones. In this new state the S1 subsite of the substrate binding region is completely reshaped and a new cavity near the S2 subsite is created.

393,UBXN3B Restricts Viral Pathogenesis by Maintaining Hematopoietic Homeostasis,"Hematopoiesis is finely regulated to enable timely production of the right number and type of mature immune cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Dysregulated hematopoiesis may compromise antiviral immunity and/or exacerbate immunopathogenesis. Herein, we report an essential and new role of ubiquitin X domain containing gene 3B (UBXN3B) in balancing myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Ubxn3b deficiency (Ubxn3b-/-) results in a remarkable increase in myeloid cells and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, along with a reduction in lymphocytes in steady-state mice. This dysregulation is exacerbated during viral infection and renders mice highly vulnerable to severe lung pathology induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and arthritis by arthritogenic alphaviruses. Ubxn3b-/- mice present normal type I IFNs, higher viral loads and inflammatory mediators, lower virus-specific immunoglobulin G and slower resolution of disease, when compared to Ubxn3b+/+ littermates. Mechanistically, Ubxn3b-/- mice have fewer multipotent progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors, but more common myeloid progenitors. In particular, the precursor and immature B cell numbers are dramatically decreased in the bone marrow of Ubxn3b-/- mice. These data demonstrate that UBXN3B signaling is essential for restricting viral infection and immunopathogenesis by maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis.",PENGHUA WANG; Tingting Geng; Duomeng Yang; Tao Lin; Andrew Harrison; Laura Haynes; Blake Torrance; Binsheng Wang; Anthony T.

394,T-cell Repertoire Characteristics of Asymptomatic and Re-detectable Positive COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundThe prevention of COVID-19 pandemic is highly complicated by the prevalence of asymptomatic and recurrent infection. Many previous immunological studies have focused on symptomatic and convalescent patients, while the immune responses in asymptomatic patients and re-detectable positive cases remain unclear.

MethodsHere we comprehensively analyzed the peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of 54 COVID-19 patients in different phases, including asymptomatic, symptomatic, convalescent and re-detectable positive cases.

ResultsWe found progressed immune responses from asymptomatic to symptomatic phase. Furthermore, the TCR profiles of re-detectable positive cases were highly similar to those of asymptomatic patients, which could predict the risk of recurrent infection.

ConclusionTherefore, TCR repertoire surveillance has the potential to strengthen the clinical management and the immunotherapy development for COVID-19.

Here, we investigated the effectiveness of commercial UVC-LED disinfection boxes in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces of personal items. We contaminated glass, metal and plastic samples representing the surfaces of personal items such as smartphones, coins or credit cards with SARS-CoV-2 formulated in an organic matrix mimicking human respiratory secretions. For disinfection, the samples were placed at different distances from UVC emitting LEDs inside commercial UVC-LED disinfection boxes and irradiated for different time periods (up to 10 minutes). High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were effectively inactivated on all surfaces after 3 minutes of irradiation. Even 10 seconds of UVC-exposure strongly reduced viral loads. Thus, UVC-LED boxes proved to be an effective method for disinfecting SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces that are typically found on personal items.",Maren Bormann; Mira Alt; Leonie Schipper; Lukas van de Sand; Mona Otte; Toni Luise Meister; Ulf Dittmer; Oliver Witzke; Eike Steinmann; Adalbert Krawczyk,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433725,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433725,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,False
396,Published Anti-SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro Hits Share Common Mechanisms of Action that Synergize with Antivirals,"The global efforts in the past few months have led to the discovery of around 200 drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19. Although most of them only exhibited moderate anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity, gaining more insights into their mechanisms of action could facilitate a better understanding of infection and the development of therapeutics. Leveraging large-scale drug-induced gene expression profiles, we found 36% of the active compounds regulate genes related to cholesterol homeostasis and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. The expression change upon drug treatment was further experimentally confirmed in human lung primary small airway. Following bioinformatics analysis on COVID-19 patient data revealed that these genes are associated with COVID-19 patient severity. The expression level of these genes also has predicted power on anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy in vitro, which led to the discovery of monensin as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-E6 cells. The final survey of recent drug- combination data indicated that drugs co-targeting cholesterol homeostasis and microtubule cytoskeleton organization processes more likely present a synergistic effect with antivirals. Therefore, potential therapeutics should be centered around combinations of targeting these processes and viral proteins.",Jing Xing; Shreya Paithankar; Ke Liu; Katie Uhl; Xiaopeng Li; Meehyun Ko; Seungtaek Kim; Jeremy Haskins; Bin Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433931,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433931,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,False
397,Multimeric nanobodies from camelid engineered mice and llamas potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Since the start of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide. Multiple vaccines have been deployed to date, but the continual evolution of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) has recently challenged their efficacy. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 variants originating in the U.K. (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and New York (B.1.526) have reduced neutralization activity from convalescent sera and compromised the efficacy of antibody cocktails that received emergency use authorization. Whereas vaccines can be updated periodically to account for emerging variants, complementary strategies are urgently needed to avert viral escape. One potential alternative is the use of camelid VHHs (also known as nanobodies), which due to their small size can recognize protein crevices that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and ""nanomice"" we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and camels. Through binding assays and cryo-electron microscopy, we identified two sets of highly neutralizing nanobodies. The first group expresses VHHs that circumvent RBD antigenic drift by recognizing a region outside the ACE2-binding site that is conserved in coronaviruses but is not typically targeted by monoclonal antibodies. The second group is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and fails to neutralize pseudoviruses carrying the E484K or N501Y substitutions. Notably however, they do neutralize the RBD variants when expressed as homotrimers, rivaling the most potent antibodies produced to date against SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrate that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2 binding domain, and recognition of conserved epitopes largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, while new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.",Jianliang Xu; Kai Xu; Seol Kyoung Jung; Andrea Conte; Jenna Lieberman; Frauke Muecksch; Julio C C Lorenzi; Solji Park; Zijun Wang; Lino Tessarollo; Tatsiana Bylund; Gwo-Yu Chuang; Adam Olia; I-Ting Teng; Tongqing Zhou; Tyler Stephens; Yaroslav Tsybovsky; Paul D Bieniasz; Theodora Hatziioannou; Michel Nussenzweig; Peter Kwong; Rafael Casellas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433768,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.433768,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,False
398,"A novel, anatomy-similar in vitro model of 3D airway epithelial for anti-coronavirus drug discovery","SARS-CoV-2 and its induced COVID-19 remains as a global health calamity. Severe symptoms and high mortality, caused by cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the lower respiratory airway, are always associated with elderly individuals and those with comorbidities; whereas mild or moderate COVID-19 patients have limited upper respiratory flu-like symptoms. There is an urgent need to investigate SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses replication and immune responses in human respiratory systems. The human reconstituted airway epithelial air-liquid interface (ALI) models are the most physiologically relevant model for the investigation of coronavirus infection and virus-triggered innate immune signatures. We established ALI models representing both the upper and the lower respiratory airway to characterize the coronavirus infection kinetics, tissue pathophysiology, and innate immune signatures from upper and lower respiratory tract perspective. Our data suggested these in vitro ALI models maintain high physiological relevance with human airway tissues. The coronavirus induced immune response observed in these upper and lower respiratory airway models are similar to what has been reported in COVID-19 patients. The antiviral efficacy results of a few promising anti-coronavirus drugs in these models were consistent with previous reports and could be valuable for the human dose prediction. Taken together, our study demonstrates the importance of 3D airway epithelial ALI model for the understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis and the discovery and development of anti-coronavirus drugs.",Yaling Zhang; Dingailu Ma; Jitao David Zhang; Xinan Liu; Qihui Zhu; Li Wang; Lu Gao,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433824,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433824,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,,False
399,Preliminary Efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 Covid-19 Vaccine Against the B.1.351 Variant,"BackgroundThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the Covid-19 pandemic. Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and use.

MethodsIn this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (5 {micro}g recombinant spike protein with 50 {micro}g Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy [&ge;]7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants.

ResultsA total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX-CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative; 6% PLWH), there were 15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8). Efficacy in HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1), and did not differ by baseline serostatus. Of the primary endpoint cases with available whole genome sequencing, 38 (92.7%) of 41 were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: - 0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants. Among placebo recipients, the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 was similar in baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive participants during the first 2 months of follow-up (5.3% vs 5.2%). Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and higher with NVX-CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

ConclusionsThe NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant, while evidence of prior infection with the presumptive original SARS-CoV-2 did not confer protection against probable B.1.351 disease.

400,"Public perception of ethical issues related to COVID-19 control measures in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia: A cross-sectional survey","BackgroundSeveral countries have implemented control measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread, including digital contact tracing, digital monitoring of quarantined individuals and testing of travelers. These raise ethical issues around privacy, personal freedoms and equity. However, little is known regarding public acceptability of these measures.

MethodsIn December 2020, we conducted surveys among 3635 respondents in Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia to understand public perceptions on the ethical acceptability of COVID-19 control measures.

FindingsHong Kong respondents were much less supportive of digital contact tracing and monitoring devices than those in Malaysia and Singapore. Around three-quarters of Hong Kong respondents perceived digital contact tracing as an unreasonable restriction of individual freedom; <20% trusted that there were adequate local provisions preventing these data being used for other purposes. This was the opposite in Singapore, where nearly three-quarters of respondents agreed that there were adequate data protection rules locally. In contrast, only a minority of Hong Kong respondents viewed mandatory testing and vaccination for travelers as unreasonable infringements of privacy or freedom. Less than two-thirds of respondents in all territories were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with a quarter of respondents undecided. However, support for differential travel restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals was high in all settings.

InterpretationOur findings highlight the importance of socio-political context in public perception of public health measures and emphasize the need to continually monitor public attitudes towards such measures to inform implementation and communication strategies.

FundingThis work was funded by the World Health Organization.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar for research articles published between 29 February 2020 to 20 January 2021 to identify empirical studies on public perception of restrictive and control measures imposed during COVID-19. We used the following terms: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-COV-2"", ""pandemic"", ""public"", ""population"", ""survey"", ""cross-sectional"", ""national"", ""international"", ""perception"", ""attitudes"", ""opinions"", ""views"", ""acceptance"", ""acceptability"", ""support"", ""ethics"", ""restrictive measures"", ""restrictions"", ""control measures"", travel"", ""contact tracing"", ""testing"", ""tests"", ""quarantine"", ""monitoring"", ""vaccines"" ""vaccination"", ""immunity"", ""certificates"", ""passports"", ""digital"", ""applications"", ""apps"", ""mandatory"" and ""compulsory"". We found 4 peer-reviewed publications: three population surveys on public acceptance of and ethical issues in digital contact tracing in France, Jordan, and Ireland, and one population survey on perceptions of immunity and vaccination certificates in Geneva, Switzerland. We found no studies that studied the relative acceptance of different types of control measures.

Added valueThere is a paucity of literature on public perception of the ethics of control measures that have been or may be implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we found differing levels of public support in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia for digital contact tracing, wearable quarantine monitoring devices, and mandatory testing and vaccination for travelers. Hong Kong respondents sharply differed from Singapore and Malaysia respondents on perceptions of risks and benefits, the extent of intrusion into individual freedom, and assurance of privacy and data protection related to use of digital contact tracing and monitoring devices. These differences are likely to be substantially influenced by socio-political climate and governmental trust. Although less than two-thirds of respondents in all territories expressed a willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19, we found high support for differential travel restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in all settings.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur survey provides evidence of strong public support of vaccination requirements for travelers within an Asian context, and differential restrictions for vaccinated and non-vaccinated travelers. It highlights the importance of wider socio-political influences on public perception and ethical issues related to control measures and emphasizes the need to continually monitor public attitudes towards such measures to inform implementation and communication strategies.",Teck Chuan Voo; Angela Ballantyne; Chirk Jenn Ng; Benjamin J Cowling; Jingyi Xiao; Kean Chang Phang; Sharon Kaur; Grazele Jenarun; Vishakha Kumar; Jane Mingjie Lim; Zaw Myo Tun; Nigel Chong Boon Wong; Clarence C Tam,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252710,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252710,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,True
401,"Lack of lockdown, open borders, and no vaccination in sight: is Bosnia and Herzegovina a control group?","Bosnia and Herzegovina is among ten countries in the world with the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 infection. Lack of lockdown, open borders, high mortality rate, no herd immunity, no vaccination plan, and strong domestic anti-vaccination movement present serious COVID-19 concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In such circumstances, we set out to study if the population is willing to receive the vaccine.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 10,471 adults in Bosnia and Herzegovina to assess the attitude of participants toward COVID-19 vaccination. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations of sociodemographic characteristics with vaccine rejection, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, preferred vaccine manufacturer, and information sources.

Surprisingly, only 25.7% of respondents indicated they would like to get a COVID-19 vaccine, while 74.3% of respondents were either hesitant or completely rejected vaccination. The vaccine acceptance increased with increasing age, education, and income level. Major motivation of pro-vaccination behaviour was intention to achieve collective immunity (30.1%), while the leading incentive for vaccine refusal was deficiency of clinical data (30.2%). The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is shown to be eightfold more preferred vaccine compared to the other manufacturers. For the first time, vaccine acceptance among health care professionals has been reported, where only 39.4% of healthcare professionals expressed willingness to get vaccinated.

With the high share of the population unwilling to vaccinate, governmental impotence in securing the vaccines supplies, combined with the lack of any lockdown measures suggests that Bosnia and Herzegovina is unlikely to put COVID-19 pandemic under control in near future.",Adnan Fojnica; Ahmed Osmanovic; Nermin Duzic; Armin Fejzic; Ensar Mekic; Zehra Gromilic; Imer Muhovic; Amina Kurtovic-Kozaric,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252700,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252700,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,True

MethodsCOVID-19 deaths were identified from death certificates. Age-adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) were compared across race/ethnicity. Proportionate mortality rates (PMR) were compared across race/ethnicity and by ethnicity/nativity.

ResultsWe identified 10,200 COVID-19 deaths in CA occurring February 1 through July 31, 2020. Decedents tended to be older, male, Hispanic, foreign-born, and have lower educational attainment. MRR indicated elevated COVID-19 morality rates among Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic groups compared with the White group, with Black and Hispanic groups having the highest MRR at 2.75 (95%CI:2.54-2.97) and 4.18 (95%CI: 3.99-4.37), respectively. Disparities were larger at younger ages. Similar results were observed with PMR, which remained in analyses stratified by education. Elevated PMR were observed in all ethnicity/nativity groups, especially foreign-born Hispanic individuals, relative to U.S.-born non-Hispanic individuals, were generally larger at younger ages, and persisted after stratifying by education.

ConclusionsDifferential COVID-19 mortality was observed in California across racial/ethnic groups and by ethnicity/nativity groups with evidence of greater disparities among younger age groups.

403,Recent changes in COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Healthcare Workers,"IntroductionEarly COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates suggest that up to one-third of HCWs may be vaccine-hesitant. However, it is unclear whether hesitancy among HCWs has improved with time and if there are temporal changes whether these differ by healthcare worker role.

MethodsIn October 2020, a brief survey was sent to all participants in the Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes (HERO) Registry with a yes/no question regarding vaccination under emergency use authorization (EUA): ""If an FDA emergency use-approved vaccine to prevent coronavirus/COVID-19 was available right now at no cost, would you agree to be vaccinated?"" The poll was repeated in December 2020, with the same question sent to all registry participants. Willingness was defined as a ""Yes"" response, and hesitancy was defined as a ""No"" response. Participants were stratified into clinical care roles. Baseline demographics of survey respondents at each timepoint were compared using appropriate univariate statistics (chi-squared and t-tests). Analyses were descriptive, with frequencies and percentages reported for each category.

ResultsOf 4882 HERO active registry participants during September 1 - October 31, 2020, 2070 (42.4%) completed the October survey, and n=1541 (31.6%) completed the December survey. 70.2% and 67.7% who were in clinical care roles, respectively. In October, 54.2% of HCWs in clinical roles said they would take an EUA-approved vaccine, which increased to 76.2% in December. The largest gain in vaccine willingness was observed among physicians, 64.0% of whom said they would take a vaccine in October, compared with 90.5% in December. Nurses were the least likely to report that they would take a vaccine in both October (46.6%) and December (66.9%). We saw no statistically significant differences in age, race/ethnicity, gender, or medical role between time points. When restricting to the 998 participants who participated at both time points, 69% were vaccine-willing at both time points; 15% were hesitant at both time points, 13% who were hesitant in October were willing in December; and 2.9% who were willing in October were hesitant in December.

ConclusionsIn a set of cross-sectional surveys of vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers, willingness improved substantially over 2 calendar months during which the US had a presidential election and two vaccine manufacturers released top-line Phase 3 trial results. While improved willingness was observed in all role categories, nurses reported the most vaccine hesitancy at both time points.",Emily C OBrien; Haolin Xu; Lauren W. Cohen; Elizabeth A.

404,Day by day symptoms following positive and negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in non-hospitalized health-care workers: a 90-day follow-up study,"BackgroundLittle is known about the long-term course of symptoms for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) when accounting for symptoms due to other causes. We aimed to compare symptoms day by day for non-hospitalised individuals who tested positive and negative with polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

MethodsWe followed 210 test-positive and 630 individually matched test-negative health-care workers of the Central Denmark Region up to 90 days after the test, April-June 2020. They daily reported seven COVID-19 related symptoms. Symptom courses were compared graphically and by conditional multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsThirty % of test-positive and close to zero of test-negative participants reported a reduced sense of taste and smell during all 90 days of follow-up (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 86.07, 95% CI 22.86-323). Dyspnoea was reported by an initial 20% of test-positive with a gradual decline to about 5% after 30 days without ever reaching the level of the test-negative participants (aOR 6.88, 95% CI 2.41-19.63). Cough, headache, sore throat, muscle aches, and fever were temporarily more prevalent among the test positive participants, but after 30 days, no increases were seen. Women and participants aged 45 years or older tended to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionPrevalence of long-lasting reduced sense of taste and smell is highly increased after being diagnosed with mild COVID-19. This pattern is also seen for dyspnoea at a low level but not for cough, sore throat, headache, muscle ache or pain, or fever.

406,"State minimum wage, paid sick leave, and food insufficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic","IntroductionPeople in low-income households face a disproportionate burden of health and economic consequences brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, including COVID-19 and food insufficiency. State minimum wage and paid sick leave policies may affect whether people are vulnerable to employment and health shocks to income and affect food insufficiency.

MethodsWe evaluated the relationship between state minimum wage policies and the outcome of household food insufficiency among participants younger than 65 during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from biweekly, state representative Census Pulse surveys conducted between August 19 and December 21, 2020. We conducted analyses in the full population under age 65 years, who are most likely to work, and in households with children. The primary exposure was state minimum wage policies in four categories: less than $8.00, $8.00 to $9.99, $10.00 to $11.99, and $12.00 or more. A secondary exposure was missing work due to COVID-19, interacted with whether participants reported not having paid sick leave. Food insufficiency was defined as sometimes or often not having enough to eat in the past seven days. Very low child food sufficiency was defined as children sometimes or often not eating enough in the past seven days because of inability to afford food. We conducted a multivariable modified Poisson regression analysis to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios and marginal effects. We clustered standard errors by state. To adjust for state health and social programs, we adjusted for health insurance and receipt of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, unemployment insurance, and stimulus payments. We conducted subgroup analyses among populations most likely to be affected by minimum wage policies: Participants who reported any work in the past seven days, who reported <$75,000 in 2019 household income, or who had a high school education or less. We conducted falsification tests among participants less likely to be directly affected by policies, [&ge;]65 years or with >$75,000 in 2019 household income.

ResultsIn states with a minimum wage of less than $8.00, 14.3% of participants under age 65 and 16.6% of participants in households with children reported household food insufficiency, while 10.3% of participants reported very low child food sufficiency. A state minimum wage of $12 or more per hour was associated with a 1.83 percentage point reduction in the proportion of households reporting food insufficiency relative to a minimum wage of less than $8.00 per hour (95% CI: -2.67 to -0.99 percentage points). In households with children, a state minimum wage of $12 or more per hour was associated with a 2.13 percentage point reduction in household food insufficiency (95% CI: -3.25 to -1.00 percentage points) and in very low child food sufficiency (-1.16 percentage points, 95% CI: -1.69 to -0.63 percentage points) relative to a state minimum wage of less than $8.00 per hour. Minimum wages of $8.00 to $9.99 and $10.00 to $11.99 were not associated with changes in child food insufficiency or very low child food sufficiency relative to less than $8.00 per hour. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main results. Estimates were of a lesser magnitude (<0.6 percentage points) in populations that should be less directly affected by state minimum wage policies. Missing work due to COVID-19 without paid sick leave was associated with a 5.72 percentage point increase in the proportion of households reporting food insufficiency (95% CI: 3.59 to 7.85 percentage points).

DiscussionFood insufficiency is high in all households and even more so in households with children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living in a state with at least a $12 minimum wage was associated with a decrease in the proportion of people reporting food insufficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not having paid leave was associated with increases in food insufficiency among people who reported missing work due to COVID-19 illness. Policymakers may wish to consider raising the minimum wage and paid sick leave as approaches to reducing food insufficiency during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",Julia Raifman; Elaine Nsoesie; Lorraine T.

407,Years of Life Lost Associated with COVID-19 Deaths in the United States During the First Year of the Pandemic,"BackgroundYears of Life Lost (YLL) measure the shortfall in life expectancy due to a medical condition and have been used in multiple contexts. Previously it was estimated that there were 1.2 million YLLs associated with COVID-19 deaths in the United States through July 11, 2020. The aim of this study is to update YLL estimates for the first full year of the pandemic.

MethodsWe employed data regarding COVID-19 deaths in the United States through January 31, 2021 by jurisdiction, gender, and age group. We used actuarial life expectancy tables by gender and age to estimate YLLs.

ResultsWe estimated roughly 3.9 million YLLs due to COVID-19 deaths, which corresponds to roughly 9.2 YLLs per death. We observed a large range across states in YLLs per 10,000 capita, with New York City at 298 and Vermont at 12. Nationally, males had a higher number of YLLs per death than females (9.5 versus 8.8), but there was significant variation in gender differences across states.

ConclusionsOur estimates provide further insight into the mortality effects of COVID-19.

408,Genetic variation of IFNL4 is associated with COVID-19,"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, representing a major public health problem. To date no effective treatments have been established. Interferons (IFNs) are being intensively investigated due to their antiviral properties. Among them, Interferon lambda 4 (IFNL4) is known to have antiviral activity against viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, hepatitis C virus (HCV), but also coronaviruses. Importantly, genetic variants of IFNL4 have been associated with spontaneous viral clearance and response to IFNs-based therapies in HCV and other RNA virus infections. However, the presence of IFNL4 variants in COVID-19 is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the rs12979860 polymorphism within IFNL4 was also associated with COVID-19. Our findings show that the presence of the CC allele of rs12979860 was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared to controls without COVID-19 (38% vs 55%, p<0.001). These results were not affected by sex, age, and severity of disease. These findings suggest that the CC allele of rs12979860 may also confer protection against COVID-19.

410,"Delayed rise of oral fluid antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever correlate with longer time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in an longitudinally sampled cohort of COVID-19 outpatients","BackgroundSustained molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) in mild to moderate COVID-19 is common. We sought to identify host and immune determinants of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

MethodsNinety-five outpatients self-collected mid-turbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. Samples were tested for viral RNA, virus culture, and SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus antibodies, and associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsViral RNA clearance, as measured by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, in 507 URT samples occurred a median (IQR) 33.5 (17-63.5) days post-symptom onset. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR positive samples tested. All participants but one with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The mean time to first antibody detection in oral fluid was 8-13 days post-symptom onset. A longer time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies (aHR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.020) and BMI [&ge;] 25kg/m2 (aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.78, p=0.009) were independently associated with a longer time to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA clearance. Fever as one of first three COVID-19 symptoms correlated with shorter time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 2.06, 95% CI 1.02-4.18, p=0.044).

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that delayed rise of oral fluid SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever are independently associated with delayed URT viral RNA clearance.",Annukka A.

411,On the Environmental Determinants of COVID-19 Seasonality,"Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID-19, are thought to spread faster over winter than during summer. It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions were more conducive to the transmission of VRD than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions, and the causal relationship is not well understood. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID-19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease. Here, we suggest that Air Drying Capacity (ADC; an atmospheric state-variable known to control the fate/evolution of the virus-laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID-19 at the seasonal time scale. These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically-based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID-19 prevalence across a broad range of climates (e.g., Germany and India). Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID-19. However, we argue that ADC and UV play a significant role in COVID-19 dynamics at the seasonal scale. These findings could help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming seasons.

Plain Language SummaryThere is growing scientific interest in the potential seasonality of COVID-19 and its links to climate variables. This study aims to determine whether four environmental variables, namely temperature, humidity, Air Drying Capacity (ADC), and ultraviolet radiation (UV), are probable environmental determinants for the observed seasonal dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence, based on extensive country-level data spanning the first year of the pandemic. Although the influence of socio-economic factors may be dominant, we here suggest that ADC and UV are key environmental determinants of COVID-19 and can potentially affect the transmission and seasonality of the disease across a wide range of climates.

Key PointsO_LIThe seasonality of COVID-19 appears to follow seasonality of some environmental variables.
C_LIO_LISeasonality of air drying capacity and ultraviolet radiation consistently match seasonality of COVID-19, across climatic zones.
C_LIO_LISeasonality of air humidity and temperature, match seasonality of COVID-19 in temperate climates, but not in tropical monsoon climates.

412,Towards Understanding the COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate,"An important parameter for COVID-19 is the case fatality rate (CFR). It has been applied to wide applications, including the measure of the severity of the infection, the estimation of the number of infected cases, risk assessment etc. However, there remains a lack of understanding on several aspects of CFR, including population factors that are important to CFR, the apparent discrepancy of CFRs in different countries, and how the age effect comes into play. We analyze the CFRs at two different time snapshots, July 6 and Dec 28, with one during the first wave and the other a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider two important population covariates, age and GDP as a proxy for the quality and abundance of public health. Extensive exploratory data analysis leads to some interesting findings. First, there is a clear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly, the exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the pandemic. Second, the roles played by the age and GDP are a little surprising: during the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their roles have switched during the second wave of the pandemic, which may be partially explained by the delay in time for the quality and abundance of public health and medical research to factor in.",Donghui Yan; Aiyou Chen; Buqing Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252698,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252698,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,True
413,365 days with COVID-19 in Iran: data analysis and epidemic curves,"BackgroundThe first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran were reported on February 19, 2020. This study aimed to analyze the epidemic curves and to investigate the correlation between epidemic parameters and furthermore to analyze the impact of control measures on the spread of COVID-19 in Iran during 365 days of the epidemic.

MethodsWe used data from February 20, 2020, to February 18, 2021, on the number of COVID-19 cases reported by Iranian governments. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to investigate the correlation between different epidemic parameters. The number of daily deaths per daily new cases was averaged to calculate daily death rate and the same method was used to investigate the rate of daily positive tests. Furthermore, we employed two different methods to calculate the effective reproduction number using reported data.

ResultsThe results showed that there was a strong correlation between the number of daily deaths and the number of daily new cases (specially the admitted cases). The results also indicated that the mean of daily death rate of COVID-19 during 365 days was 4.9 percent, and averagely 13.9 percent of daily tests results were positive. Furthermore, epidemic curves showed that implementing strict social distancing measures effectively reduced the number of confirmed cases. The effective reproduction curve indicated that social distancing is still necessary to control the spread of COVID-19 in Iran.

ConclusionsAnalyzing the prevention and control measures indicated that the strict social distancing implemented by the government effectively reduces the number of new cases and deaths. The curve of reproduction number also showed that effective reproduction number is still above one; hence, it is necessary to continue strict social distancing and control travelling to prevent causing another wave of outbreak especially in Persian New Year.",Ebrahim Sahafizadeh; Saeed Talatian Azad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252694,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252694,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,True
414,Experiences of COVID-19 Recovered Patients - A Qualitative Case Study from a Hotspot in Saudi Arabia,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is highly contagious and can have fatal outcomes in the elderly and those with comorbidities. Social distancing is highly recommended by the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the disease. However, it is difficult to maintain social distancing in highly populated areas where people live in close proximity. Such high-risk areas have the potential to become hotspots for the disease spread, should one person therein contract the disease. Nakkasah is one such area in the Makkah city of Saudi Arabia which has been a hotspot in this pandemic. This study aims to qualitatively explore the experiences of COVID-19 recovered patients residing in this area.

MethodsWe employed semi-structured face-to-face interviews with people living in Nakkasah, above 18 years of age, and recovered from COVID-19. An interview guide was developed, validated, piloted, and minor changes were made. Two trained students conducted the interviews in the Arabic language in a semi-private area of the community center. The interviews were audio-recorded, with informed consent from interviewees, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed later.

ResultsEleven eligible COVID-19 recovered people (two female and nine male) agreed to be interviewed, and their verbal informed consent was audio recorded. The mean interview time was 24 minutes. Thematic analysis generated 30 subthemes, which were categorized into seven overarching themes: information about COVID-19; life during COVID-19 illness; spreading of COVID-19; precautionary measures; interventions that helped in recovery; impact of COVID-19 on life; support received during COVID-19 illness.

415,An overview of the National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database: data quality and cohort analysis,"The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID) is a centralised database containing chest X-rays, chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) from patients across the UK, jointly established by NHSX, the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI), Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust (RSNFT) and Faculty. The objective of the initiative is to support a better understanding of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and development of machine learning (ML) technologies that will improve care for patients hospitalised with a severe COVID-19 infection. The NCCID is now accumulating data from 20 NHS Trusts and Health Boards across England and Wales, with a total contribution of approximately 25,000 imaging studies in the training set (at time of writing) and is actively being used as a research tool by several organisations. This paper introduces the training dataset, including a snapshot analysis performed by NHSX covering: the completeness of clinical data, the availability of image data for the various use-cases (diagnosis, prognosis and longitudinal risk) and potential model confounders within the imaging data. The aim is to inform both existing and potential data users of the NCCIDs suitability for developing diagnostic/prognostic models.

416,Atorvastatin effectively inhibits late replicative cycle steps of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) has caused a pandemic of historic proportions and continues to spread worldwide. Currently, there is no effective therapy against this virus. This article evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 and also identified the interaction affinity between Atorvastatin and three SARS-CoV-2 proteins, using in silico structure-based molecular docking approach.

Materials and methodsThe antiviral activity of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by three different treatment strategies using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of Atorvastatin with Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) was evaluated by molecular docking.

ResultsAtorvastatin showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of 79%, 54.8%, 22.6% and 25% at 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 {micro}M, respectively, by pre-post-treatment strategy. In addition, atorvastatin demonstrated an antiviral effect of 26.9% at 31.2 {micro}M by pre-infection treatment. This compound also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in 66.9%, 75%, 27.9% and 29.2% at concentrations of 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 {micro}M, respectively, by post-infection treatment. The interaction of atorvastatin with SARS-CoV-2 Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease yielded a binding affinity of -8.5 Kcal/mol, -6.2 Kcal/mol, and -7.5 Kcal/mol, respectively.

ConclusionOur study demonstrated the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Atorvastatin, mainly against the late steps of the viral replicative cycle. A favorable binding affinity with viral proteins by bioinformatics methods was also shown. Due to its low cost, availability, well-established safety and tolerability, and the extensive clinical experience of atorvastatin, it could prove valuable in reducing morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the largest global public health crisis in a century, with enormous health and socioeconomic challenges. Therefore, it is necessary to search for specific antivirals against its causative agent (SARS-CoV-2). In this sense, the use of existing drugs may represent a useful treatment option in terms of safety, cost-effectiveness, and timeliness. Atorvastatin is widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. This compound modulates the synthesis of cholesterol, a molecule necessary in different stages of the viral replicative cycle. Our study demonstrated the antiviral potential of atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2, using an in vitro model. Furthermore, the ability of Atorvastatin to directly interfere with three viral targets (Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease) was demonstrated by bioinformatic methods. This compound is a well-studied, low-cost, and generally well-tolerated drug, so it could be a promising antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19.",Maria Isabel Zapata-Cardona; Lizdany Flórez-Álvarez; Wildeman Zapata-Builes; Ariadna Guerra-Sandoval; Carlos Guerra-Almonacid; Jaime Hincapié-García; Maria Teresa Rugeles; Juan Carlos Hernández,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433498,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433498,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,False
417,Estimation of secondary household attack rates for emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants detected by genomic surveillance at a community-based testing site in San Francisco,"BackgroundSequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome from patient samples is an important epidemiological tool for monitoring and responding to the pandemic, including the emergence of new mutations in specific communities.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples collected, along with epidemiological metadata, at a walk-up, rapid testing site in the Mission District of San Francisco, California during November 22-December 2, 2020 and January 10-29, 2021. Secondary household attack rates and mean sample viral load were estimated and compared across observed variants.

ResultsA total of 12,124 tests were performed yielding 1,099 positives. From these, 811 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations, defined in part by L452R, S13I, and W152C, comprised 54.9% of the total sequences from January, compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to ""West Coast"" variants were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.357 vs 0.294, RR=1.29; 95% CI:1.01-1.64). The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020. Viral loads were similar among persons infected with West Coast versus non-West Coast strains, as was the proportion of individuals with symptoms (60.9% vs 64.1%).

ConclusionsThe increase in prevalence, relative household attack rates, and reproductive number are consistent with a modest transmissibility increase of the West Coast variants; however, additional laboratory and epidemiological studies are required to better understand differences between these variants.

SummaryWe observed a growing prevalence and elevated attack rate for ""West Coast"" SARS-CoV-2 variants in a community testing setting in San Francisco during January 2021, suggesting its modestly higher transmissibility.","James Peng; Sabrina A, Mann; Anthea M.

418,Recent Gains in Life Expectancy Reversed by the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Increasing life expectancy at birth, a widely-used indicator of population health and mortality, is considered a policy goal in every country. Measures of excess deaths suggest the COVID-19 pandemic substantially increased mortality in 2020 in many countries (Karlinsky and Kobak, 2021). However, because of variations in the age patterns and magnitudes of excess deaths across countries, comparing the mortality impacts of the pandemic is difficult (Aburto et al., 2021; Pifarre i Arolas et al., 2021). Life expectancy overcomes these limitations while providing a clear picture of the toll of the pandemic on mortality (Goldman and Lord, 1986; Aburto et al., 2020). Here we show that the COVID-19 pandemic halted improvements in longevity and progress mortality reductions at older ages in 2020. Life expectancy at birth declined from 2019 to 2020 in 25 out of 27 countries for which high-quality vital statistics are presently available, including most European countries, Chile and the USA. Males in the USA and Bulgaria experienced the largest losses in life expectancy at birth during 2020 (2.1 and 1.6 years respectively), but staggering reductions of more than an entire year were documented in eleven countries for males, and eight among females; a magnitude of loss not witnessed since WW-II in many countries. Reductions were mostly attributable to increased mortality above age 60 and to official COVID-19 deaths.",José Manuel Aburto; Jonas Schöley; Luyin Zhang; Ilya Kashnitsky; Charles Rahal; Trifon Missov; Melinda C Mills; Jennifer Beam Dowd; Ridhi Kashyap,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252772,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21252772,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,True
419,"A novel, multiplexed RT-qPCR assay to distinguish lineage B.1.1.7 from the remaining SARS-CoV-2 lineages","The emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant called lineage B.1.1.7 sparked global alarm due to evidence of increased transmissibility, mortality, and uncertainty about vaccine efficacy, thus accelerating efforts to detect and track the variant. Current approaches to detect lineage B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant. Since many countries lack robust genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect multiple unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7, we sought to develop an RT-qPCR test that can accurately and rapidly differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used bioinformatics, allele-specific PCR, and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to develop a test that differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing. Our room temperature-stable, multiplexed RT-qPCR test consists of two assays that target either the common SARS-CoV-2 spike gene or spike gene deletions specific to lineage B.1.1.7. A simple relative comparison of the Ct values of the two assays permits not only identification of the B.1.1.7 variant but also its differentiation from other variants that harbor only the {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 deletion.The test showed 97% clinical sensitivity at detecting lineage B.1.1.7. This test can easily be implemented in labs to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and is particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.",Viera Kovacova; Kristína Boršová; Evan D Paul; Monika Radvanszka; Roman Hajdu; Viktória Čabanová; Monika Sláviková; Martina Ličková; Ľubomíra Lukáčiková; Andrej Belak; Lucia Roussier; Michaela Kostičová; Anna Líšková; Lucia Maďarová; Mária Štefkovičová; Lenka Reizigová; Elena Nováková; Peter Sabaka; Alena Koščálová; Broňa Brejová; Tomas Vinar; Jozef Nosek; Pavol Cekan; Boris Klempa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251168,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251168,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,True
420,Modeling University Reopening in Low Risk Countries During COVID-19,"The safety of students worldwide remains a key issue during COVID-19. The reopening of universities in high risk countries during Fall 2020 resulted in numerous outbreaks. While regular screening and testing on campus can prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are extremely challenging to implement due to various reasons such as cost and logistics. However, for low risk countries, our study suggests that universities can fully reopen without testing, if students self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival and adopt proper nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We adopt agent-based simulation to model virus transmission on campus and test the effectiveness of several NPIs when school reopens. Assuming one initially infected student, results indicate that transmission between roommates causes the most infections with visitors, ground floors, and elevators, being the next main contributors. Limiting density and/or population are not impactful at flattening the curve. However, adopting masks, minimizing movement, and increasing the frequency of cleaning can effectively minimize infection and prevent outbreak, allowing for classes and activities to resume as normal.",Jing Yang (Sunny) Xi; Wai Kin (Victor) Chan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21250607,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21250607,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,True
421,"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities: a qualitative study on the perspectives of BAME community leaders","ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of BAME community leaders in relation to - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their communities; and BAME communitys perception, understanding and adherence to Government guidelines on COVID-19 public health measures.

DesignA phenomenological approach was adopted using qualitative semi-structured interviews.

SettingsCommunity organisations and places of worships in the West Midlands region of England.

ParticipantsCommunity leaders were recruited through organisations representing BAME communities and religious places of worship.

ResultsA total of 19 participants took part. Participants alluded to historical and structural differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Many struggled with lockdown measures which impeded cultural and religious gatherings that were deemed to be integral to the community. Cultural and social practices led to many suffering on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many communities. Many expressed their communitys reluctance to report symptoms for the fear of financial and physical health implications. They reported increase in hate crime which was deemed to be exacerbated due to perceived insensitive messaging from authority officials and historical structural biases. Access and adherence to government guidelines was an issue for many due to language and digital barriers. Reinforcement from trusted community and religious leaders encouraged adherence. Points of support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford masks and sanitisers.

ConclusionThe study highlights the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic on BAME communities. Government agencies and public health agencies need to integrate with the community, and community leaders to penetrate the key messages and deliver targeted yet sensitive public health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing route cause of disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics.

422,A pharmacophore model for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro small molecule inhibitors and in vitro experimental validation of computationally screened inhibitors,"Among the biomedical efforts in response to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, pharmacological strategies to reduce viral load in patients with severe forms of the disease are being studied intensively. One of the main drug target proteins proposed so far is the SARS-CoV-2 viral protease 3CLpro (also called Mpro), an essential component for viral replication. Ongoing ligand- and receptor-based computational screening efforts would be facilitated by an improved understanding of the electrostatic, hydrophobic and steric features that characterize small molecule inhibitors binding stably to 3CLpro, as well as by an extended collection of known binders.

Here, we present combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, machine learning and in vitro experimental validation analyses which have led to the identification of small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro with micromolar activity, and to a pharmacophore model that describes functional chemical groups associated with the molecular recognition of ligands by the 3CLpro binding pocket. Experimentally validated inhibitors using a ligand activity assay include natural compounds with available prior knowledge on safety and bioavailability properties, such as the natural compound rottlerin (IC50 = 37 M), and synthetic compounds previously not characterized (e.g. compound CID 46897844, IC50 = 31 M). In combination with the developed pharmacophore model, these and other confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors may provide a basis for further similarity-based screening in independent compound databases and structural design optimization efforts, to identify 3CLpro ligands with improved potency and selectivity.

Overall, this study suggests that the integration of virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning can facilitate 3CLpro-targeted small molecule screening investigations. Different receptor-, ligand- and machine learning-based screening strategies provided complementary information, helping to increase the number and diversity of identified active compounds. Finally, the resulting pharmacophore model and experimentally validated small molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro provide resources to support follow-up computational screening efforts for this drug target.",Enrico Glaab; Ganesh Babu Manoharan; Daniel Abankwa,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.433618,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.433618,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,False
423,Blockade of SARS-CoV-2 infection in-vitro by highly potent PI3K-α/mTOR/BRD4 inhibitor,"Pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV hijack the host molecular machinery to establish infection and survival in infected cells. This has led the scientific community to explore the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, establishes productive infection, and causes life-threatening pathophysiology. Very few targeted therapeutics for COVID-19 currently exist, such as remdesivir. Recently, a proteomic approach explored the interactions of 26 of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with cellular targets in human cells and identified 67 interactions as potential targets for drug development. Two of the critical targets, the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs): BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR, are inhibited by the dual inhibitory small molecule SF2523 at nanomolar potency. SF2523 is the only known mTOR PI3K-/(BRD2/BRD4) inhibitor with potential to block two orthogonal pathways necessary for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in human cells. Our results demonstrate that SF2523 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, showing an IC50 value of 1.5 {micro}M, comparable to IC50 value of remdesivir (1.1 {micro}M). Further, we demonstrated that the combination of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir is highly synergistic: it allows for the reduction of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir by 25-fold and 4-fold, respectively, to achieve the same potency observed for a single inhibitor. Because SF2523 inhibits two SARS-CoV-2 driven pathogenesis mechanisms involving BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR signaling, our data suggest that SF2523 alone or in combination with remdesivir could be a novel and efficient therapeutic strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence be beneficial in preventing severe COVID-19 disease evolution.

A number of likely pathogenic autoreactive antibodies have been associated with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet, many additional autoantibodies likely remain unknown. Here we present Molecular Indexing of Proteins by Self Assembly (MIPSA), a technique that produces ORFeome-scale libraries of proteins covalently coupled to uniquely identifying DNA barcodes for analysis by sequencing. We used MIPSA to profile circulating autoantibodies from 55 patients with severe COVID-19 against 11,076 DNA-barcoded proteins of the human ORFeome library. MIPSA identified previously known autoreactivities, and also detected undescribed neutralizing interferon lambda 3 (IFN-{lambda}3) autoantibodies. At-risk individuals with anti-IFN-{lambda}3 antibodies may benefit from interferon supplementation therapies, such as those currently undergoing clinical evaluation.

425,Low-dose lung radiotherapy for COVID-19 lung disease: a pre-clinical efficacy study in a bleomycin model of pneumonitis.,"PurposeLow-dose whole lung radiotherapy (LDLR) has been proposed as a treatment for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical trials are underway. There is an urgent need for preclinical evidence to justify this approach and inform dose, scheduling and mechanisms of action.

Materials and methodsFemale C57BL/6 mice were treated with intranasal bleomycin sulphate (7.5 or 11.25 units/kg, day 0), then exposed to whole lung radiation therapy (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 Gy or sham, day 3). Bodyweight was measured daily and lung tissue harvested for histology and flow cytometry on day 10. Computed tomography (CT) lung imaging was performed pre-radiation (day 3) and pre-endpoint (day 10).

ResultsBleomycin caused pneumonitis of variable severity which correlated with weight loss. LDLR at 1.0 Gy was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of mice recovering to 98% of initial bodyweight and a proportion of these mice exhibited less severe histopathological lung changes. Mice experiencing moderate initial weight loss were more likely to respond to LDLR than those experiencing severe initial weight loss. Additionally, LDLR (1.0 Gy) significantly reduced bleomycin-induced increases in interstitial macrophages, CD103+ dendritic cells and neutrophil-DC hybrids. Overall,bleomycin-treated mice exhibited significantly higher percentages of non-aerated lung in left than right lungs and LDLR (1.0 Gy) prevented further reductions in aerated lung volume in right but not left lungs. LDLR at 0.5 and 1.5 Gy did not modulate bodyweight or flow cytometric readouts of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis.

ConclusionsOur data support the concept that LDLR can ameliorate acute inflammatory lung injury, identify 1.0 Gy as the most effective dose and provide preliminary evidence that it is more effective in the context of moderate than severe pneumonitis. Mechanistically, LDLR at 1.0 Gy significantly suppressed bleomycin-induced accumulation of pulmonary interstitial macrophages, CD103+ dendritic cells and neutrophil-DC hybrids.",Mark R Jackson; Katrina Stevenson; Sandeep K Chahal; Emer Curley; George Finney; Rodrigo Gutierrez-Quintana; Evarest Onwubiko; Angelika F Rupp; Karen Strathdee; Megan KL MacLeod; Charles McSharry; Anthony J Chalmers,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433704,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433704,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,False
426,Altered Sub-Genomic RNA Expression in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Infections,"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 viruses are more transmissible, may lead to greater clinical severity, and result in modest reductions in antibody neutralization. subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) is produced by discontinuous transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and is a crucial step in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Applying our tool (periscope) to ARTIC Network Oxford Nanopore genomic sequencing data from 4400 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples, we show that normalised sgRNA expression profiles are significantly increased in B.1.1.7 infections (n=879). This increase is seen over the previous dominant circulating lineage in the UK, B.1.177 (n=943), which is independent of genomic reads, E gene cycle threshold and days since symptom onset at sampling. A noncanonical sgRNA which could represent ORF9b is found in 98.4% of B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with only 13.8% of other lineages, with a 16-fold increase in median expression. We hypothesise that this is a direct consequence of a triple nucleotide mutation in nucleocapsid (28280:GAT>CAT, D3L) creating a transcription regulatory-like sequence complementary to a region 3 of the genomic leader. These findings provide a unique insight into the biology of B.1.1.7 and support monitoring of sgRNA profiles in sequence data to evaluate emerging potential variants of concern.

428,Identification and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 leader subgenomic mRNA gene junctions in nasopharyngeal samples shows phasic transcription in animal models of COVID-19 and aberrant pattens in humans,"IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 has a complex strategy for the transcription of viral subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), which are targets for nucleic acid diagnostics. Each of these sgRNAs has a unique 5 sequence, the leader-transcriptional regulatory sequence gene junction (leader-TRS-junction), that can be identified using sequencing.

ResultsHigh resolution sequencing has been used to investigate the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the host response in cell culture models and from clinical samples. LeTRS, a bioinformatics tool, was developed to identify leader-TRS-junctions and be used as a proxy to quantify sgmRNAs for understanding virus biology. This was tested on published datasets and clinical samples from patients and longitudinal samples from animal models with COVID-19.

DiscussionLeTRS identified known leader-TRS-junctions and identified novel species that were common across different species. The data indicated multi-phasic abundance of sgmRNAs in two different animal models, with spikes in sgmRNA abundance reflected in human samples, and therefore has implications for transmission models and nucleic acid-based diagnostics.",Rebekah Penrice-Randal; Hannah Goldswain; Tessa Prince; Nadine Randle; Javier Salguero; Julia Tree; Ecaterina Vamos; Charlotte Nelson; James P.

429,Maturation signatures of conventional dendritic cells in COVID-19 reflect direct viral sensing,"Growing evidence suggests that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) undergo aberrant maturation in COVID-19, and this adversely affects T cell activation. Here, we find that cDC2 subtypes show similar infection-induced gene signatures with an increasing gradient of expression of interferon-stimulated genes from mild to severe patients and a down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) molecules and some inflammatory cytokines compared to the baseline level of healthy donors. In vitro, the direct exposure of cDC2s to the virus recapitulates the type of activation observed in vivo. Our findings provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can directly interact with cDC2s and, by down-regulating crucial molecules required for T cell activation, implements an efficient immune escape mechanism.

430,Dissecting CD8+ T cell pathology of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection by single-cell epitope mapping,"The current COVID-19 pandemic represents a global challenge. A better understanding of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is key to unveil the differences in disease severity and to develop future vaccines targeting novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Feature barcode technology combined with CITE-seq antibodies and DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC I Dextramer reagents enabled us to identify relevant SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes and compare epitope-specific CD8+ T cell populations between mild and severe COVID-19. We identified a strong CD8+ T cell response against an S protein-derived epitope. CD8+ effector cells in severe COVID-19 displayed hyperactivation, T cell exhaustion and were missing characteristics of long-lived memory T cells. We identify A*0101 WTAGAAAYY as an immunogenic CD8+ T cell epitope with the ability to drive clonal expansion. We provide an in-depth characterization of the CD8+ T cell-mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 infection which will be relevant for the development of molecular and targeted therapies and potential adjustments of vaccination strategies.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.432690,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.432690,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,False
431,"Comparative analysis of codon usage patterns in SARS-CoV-2, its mutants and other respiratory viruses","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a worldwide human health crisis, causing respiratory illness with a high mortality rate. To investigate the factors governing codon usage bias in all the respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geographical locations (~62K), including two recently emerging strains from the United Kingdom (UK), i.e., VUI202012/01 and South Africa (SA), i.e., 501.Y.V2 codon usage bias (CUBs) analysis was performed. The analysis includes RSCU analysis, GC content calculation, ENC analysis, dinucleotide frequency and neutrality plot analysis. We were motivated to conduct the study to fulfil two primary aims: first, to identify the difference in codon usage bias amongst all SARS-CoV-2 genomes and, secondly, to compare their CUBs properties with other respiratory viruses. A biased nucleotide composition was found as most of the highly preferred codons were A/U-ending in all the respiratory viruses studied here. Compared with the human host, the RSCU analysis led to the identification of 11 over-represented codons and 9 under-represented codons in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Correlation analysis of ENC and GC3s revealed that mutational pressure is the leading force determining the CUBs. The present study results yield a better understanding of codon usage preferences for SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discover the possible evolutionary determinants responsible for the biases found among the respiratory viruses, thus unveils a unique feature of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at comparative CUBs analysis on the worldwide genomes of SARS-CoV-2, including novel emerged strains and other respiratory viruses.",Neetu Tyagi; Rahila Sardar; Dinesh Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433699,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.433699,2021-03-03,2021-03-03,,False
432,"Genomics and epidemiology of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Manaus, Brazil","Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Manaus, Brazil, resurged in late 2020, despite high levels of previous infection there. Through genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021, we identified the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, lineage P.1, that acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around early November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.4-2.2 times more transmissible and 25-61% more likely to evade protective immunity elicited by previous infection with non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.

433,Impact of COVID-19 pre-test probability on positive predictive value of high cycle threshold SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription PCR test results,"BackgroundPerformance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assays are understudied within contexts of low pre-test probability, including screening asymptomatic persons without epidemiological links to confirmed cases, or asymptomatic surveillance testing. SARS-CoV-2 detection without symptoms may represent resolved infection with persistent RNA shedding, presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, or a false positive test. This study assessed clinical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays by retesting positive specimens from five pre-test probability groups ranging from high to low with an alternate assay.

Materials and MethodsA total of 122 rRT-PCR positive specimens collected from unique patients between March and July 2020 were retested using a laboratory-developed nested RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene followed by Sanger sequencing.

ResultsSignificantly less positive results in the lowest pre-test probability group (facilities with institution-wide screening having [&le;] 3 positive asymptomatic cases) were reproduced with the nested RdRp gene RT-PCR assay than in all other groups combined (5/32, 15{middle dot}6% vs 61/90, 68%; p <0{middle dot}0001), and in each subgroup with higher pre-test probability (individual subgroup range 50{middle dot}0% to 85{middle dot}0%).

ConclusionsA higher proportion of false-positive test results are likely with lower pre-test probability. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results should be interpreted within the context of patient history, clinical setting, known exposure, and estimated community disease prevalence. Large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening testing initiatives among low pre-test probability populations should be evaluated thoroughly prior to implementation given the risk of false positives and consequent potential for harm at the individual and population level.",Jonathan B Gubbay; Heather Rilkoff; Heather L.

434,Relation of severe COVID-19 in Scotland to transmission-related factors and risk conditions eligible for shielding support: REACT-SCOT case-control study,"ObjectivesTo investigate:(1) the risk of severe COVID-19 in those eligible for shielding, and (2) the relation of severe COVID-19 to transmission-related factors in those in shielding and the general population.

DesignMatched case-control study (REACT-SCOT).

SettingPopulation of Scotland from 1 March 2020 to 28 January 2021.

ParticipantsAll 160307 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and 1564782 controls matched for age, sex and primary care practice, linked with all 204913 individuals identified as eligible for shielding by Public Health Scotland.

Main outcome measureSevere COVID-19, defined as cases that entered critical care or were fatal.

ResultsWith those without risk conditions as reference category, the univariate rate ratio for severe COVID-19 was 5.3 (95% CI 5.0 to 5.7, p=4 x 10-527) in those with moderate risk conditions and 7.6 (95% CI 7.1 to 8.3, p=1 x 10-527) in those eligible for shielding. The highest rate was in solid organ transplant recipients: rate ratio 13.6 (95% CI 9.6 to 19.2, p=8 x 10-50). In both the shielded and the general population, the risk of severe COVID-19 increased with the number of adults but decreased with the number of school-age children in the household. Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with recent exposure to hospital (defined as 5 to 14 days before presentation date): rate ratio 12.6 (95% CI 11.7 to 13.6, p=2 x 10-989) overall. In a case-crossover analysis with less recent exposure only (15 to 24 days before first testing positive) as reference category, the rate ratio associated with recent exposure only was 6.3 (95% CI 3.6 to 11.1, p=2 x 10-10). Among those eligible for shielding, the population attributable risk fraction (PARF) of severe cases for recent exposure to hospital was 36%. In the general population the PARF for recent exposure to hospital peaked at 46% in May 2020 and again at 64% in December 2020.

ConclusionsThe effectiveness of shielding vulnerable individuals was limited by the inability to control transmission in hospital and from other adults in the household. For solid organ transplant recipients, in whom the efficacy of vaccines is uncertain, these results support a policy of offering vaccination to household contacts. Mitigating the impact of the epidemic requires control of nosocomial transmission.

435,SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Characteristics of COVID-19 Persistence and Reinfection,"BackgroundBoth SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistent infection have been described, but a systematic assessment of mutations is needed. We assessed sequences from published cases of COVID-19 reinfection and persistence, characterizing the hallmarks of reinfecting sequences and the rate of viral evolution in persistent infection.

MethodsA systematic review of PubMed was conducted to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistent infection with available sequences. Amino acid changes in the reinfecting sequence were compared to both the initial and contemporaneous community variants. Time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed to compare intra-host viral evolution in persistent COVID-19 to community-driven evolution.

ResultsFourteen reinfection and five persistent infection cases were identified. Reports of reinfection cases spanned a broad distribution of ages, baseline health status, reinfection severity, and occurred as early as 1.5 months or >8 months after the initial infection. The reinfecting viral sequences had a median of 9 amino acid changes with enrichment of changes in the S, ORF8 and N genes. The number of amino acid changes did not differ by the severity of reinfection and reinfecting variants were similar to the contemporaneous sequences circulating in the community. Patients with persistent COVID-19 demonstrated more rapid accumulation of mutations than seen with community-driven evolution with continued viral changes during convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody treatment.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 reinfection does not require an unusual set of circumstances in the host or virus, while persistent COVID-19 is largely described in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with accelerated viral evolution as measured by clock rates.",Manish Chandra Choudhary; Charles R Crain; Xueting Qiu; William Hanage; Jonathan Z.

436,Upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults,"ObjectivesThere is limited information comparing SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (URT) between children and adults, either presenting with COVID-19 or asymptomatic. Here we conducted a retrospective, single center study involving a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to address this issue.

Patients and MethodsA total of 1,184 consecutive subjects (256 children and 928 adults) testing positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal exudates (NP) were included, of whom 424 (121 children and 303 adults) had COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization and 760 (135 children and 625 adults) were asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing was carried out using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MS, USA). The AMPLIRUN(R) TOTAL SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control (Vircell SA, Granada, Spain) was used for estimating SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads (in copies/mL).

ResultsMedian SARS-COV-2 RNA loads were comparable between adults and children with COVID-19 (7.14 log10 copies/ml vs. 6.98 log10 copies/ml; P=0.094). Median SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in asymptomatic children and adults was similar (6.20 log10 copies/ml vs. 6.48 log10 copies/ml; P=0.97). Children with COVID-19 symptoms displayed SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads comparable to their asymptomatic counterparts (P=0.61). Meanwhile in adults, median SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was significantly higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic subjects (P=<0.001), yet comparable (P=0.61) when the analysis excluded patients sampled within 48 h after symptoms onset.

437,"Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers in the United Kingdom: UK-REACH ethico-legal research, qualitative research on healthcare workers' experiences, and stakeholder engagement protocol","IntroductionAs the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging evidence suggests that individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds may be disproportionately affected. The UK-REACH project has been initiated to understand ethnic differentials in COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK) through five inter-linked work packages. The ethico-legal work package (Work Package 3) aims to understand and address legal, ethical and acceptability issues around big data research; the healthcare workers experiences work package (Work Package 4) is a qualitative study exploring healthcare workers experiences during COVID-19 and; the stakeholder engagement work package (Work Package 5) aims to provide feedback and support with the formulation and dissemination of the project recommendations.

Methods and AnalysisWork Package 3 has two different research strands: (a) desk-based doctrinal research; and (b) empirical qualitative research with key opinion leaders. For the empirical research, in-depth interviews will be conducted digitally and recorded with participants permission. Recordings will be transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis. In Work Package 4, online in-depth interviews and focus groups will be conducted with approximately 150 HCWs, from across the UK, and these will be recorded with participants consent. The recordings will be transcribed, coded and data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Work Package 5 will achieve its objectives through regular group meetings and in-group discussions.

Ethics and DisseminationEthical approval has been received from the London - Brighton & Sussex Research Ethics Committee of the Health Research Authority (Ref No. 20/HRA/4718). Results of the study will be published in open access journals, and disseminated through conference presentations, project website, stakeholder organisations, media and scientific advisory groups.

Registration DetailsRegistered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN11811602).

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYO_LIThe dual approach of doctrinal and empirical research (Work Package 3) on the use of personal data by UK-REACH will give a comprehensive understanding of the ethical and legal implications of the study, and perceptions about its use of data.
C_LIO_LIQualitative research with healthcare workers in the UK on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (Work Package 4) will provide insight into personal behaviour, perceptions of risk and coping mechanisms adopted both inside and outside of the work environment.
C_LIO_LIStakeholder engagement (Work Package 5) from professional regulatory bodies and staff groups is embedded within the UK-REACH study to provide feedback on project activities and support with project recommendations.
C_LIO_LIThe target participants (key opinion leaders) for Work Package 3 empirical study will likely come from predominantly White backgrounds which may limit the breadth of views obtained in interviews. This limitation will be mitigated by active recruitment of opinion leaders from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds and active interaction with Work Package 5.
C_LIO_LIDue to the pandemic restrictions, interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted via online methods as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, posing practical and technological challenges for dynamic interaction with participants.

438,Trajectories of Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics Associated with COVID-19 in Hemodialysis Patients by Survival,"IntroductionThe clinical impact of COVID-19 has not been established in the dialysis population. We evaluated the trajectories of clinical and laboratory parameters in hemodialysis (HD) patients.

MethodsWe used data from adult HD patients treated at an integrated kidney disease company who received a RT-PCR test to investigate suspicion of a SARS-CoV-2 infection between 01 May and 01 Sep 2020. Nonparametric smoothing splines were used to fit data for individual trajectories and estimate the mean change over time in patients testing positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 and those who survived or died within 30 days of first suspicion or positive test date. For each clinical parameter of interest, the difference in average daily changes between COVID-19 positive versus negative group and COVID-19 survivor versus non-survivor group was estimated by fitting a linear mixed effects model based on measurements in the 14 days before (i.e., day-14 to day 0) day 0.

ResultsThere were 12,836 HD patients with a suspicion of COVID-19 who received RT-PCR testing (8,895 SARS-CoV-2 positive). We observed significantly different trends (p<0.05) in pre-HD systolic blood pressure (SBP), pre-HD pulse rate, body temperature, ferritin, lymphocytes, albumin, and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) between COVID-19 positive and negative patient. For COVID-19 positive group, we observed significantly different clinical trends (p<0.05) in pre-HD pulse rate, lymphocytes, albumin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) between survivors and non-survivors. We also observed that, in the group of survivors, most clinical parameters returned to pre-COVID-19 levels within 60-90 days.

ConclusionWe observed unique temporal trends in various clinical and laboratory parameters among HD patients who tested positive versus negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who survived the infection versus those who died.

439,Modeling COVID-19 Nonpharmaceutical Interventions: Exploring periodic NPI strategies,"In April 2020, we developed a COVID-19 transmission model used as part of RANDs web-based COVID-19 decision support tool that compares the effects of different nonphar-maceutical public health interventions (NPIs) on health and economic outcomes. An interdis-ciplinary approach informed the selection and use of multiple NPIs, combining quantitative modeling of the health/economic impacts of interventions with qualitative assessments of other important considerations (e.g., cost, ease of implementation, equity). We previously published a description of our approach as a RAND report describing how the epidemiological model, the economic model, and a systematic assessment of NPIs informed the web-tool. This paper provides further details of our model, describes extensions that we made to our model since April, presents sensitivity analyses, and analyzes periodic NPIs. Our findings suggest that there are opportunities to shape the tradeoffs between economic and health outcomes by carefully evaluating a more comprehensive range of reopening policies.

440,Comparative performance of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antigen tests demonstrates their utility for high sensitivity detection of infectious virus in clinical specimens,"BackgroundRapid antigen lateral flow devices (LFDs) are set to become a cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 mass community testing. However, their reduced sensitivity compared to PCR has raised questions of how well they identify infectious cases. Understanding their capabilities and limitations is therefore essential for successful implementation. To address this, we evaluated six commercial LFDs on the same collection of clinical samples and assessed their correlation with infectious virus culture and cycle threshold (Ct) values.

MethodsA head-to-head comparison of specificities and sensitivities was performed on six commercial rapid antigen tests using combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, and their limits of detection determined using viral plaque forming units (PFU). Three of the LFDs were selected for a further study, correlating antigen test result with RT-PCR Ct values and positive viral culture in Vero-E6 cells. This included sequential swabs and matched serum samples obtained from four infected individuals with varying disease severities. Detection of antibodies was performed using an IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, and neutralising antibodies by infectious virus assay. Finally, the sensitivities of selected rapid antigen LFTs were assessed in swabs with confirmed B.1.1.7 variant, currently the dominant genotype in the UK.

FindingsMost of the rapid antigen LFDs showed a high specificity (>98%), and accurately detected 50 PFU/test (equivalent N1 Ct of 23.7 or RNA copy number of 3x106/ml). Sensitivities of the LFDs performed on clinical samples ranged from 65 to 89%. These sensitivities increased in most tests to over 90% for samples with Cts lower than 25. Positive virus culture was achieved for 57 out of 141 samples, with 80% of the positive cultures from swabs with Cts lower than 23. Importantly, sensitivity of the LFDs increased to over 95% when compared with the detection of infectious virus alone, irrespective of Ct. Longitudinal studies of PCR-positive samples showed that most of the tests identified all infectious samples as positive, but differences in test sensitivities can lead to missed cases in the absence of repeated testing. Finally, test performance was not impacted when re-assessed against swabs positive for the dominant UK variant B.1.1.7.

InterpretationIn this comprehensive comparison of antigen LFD and virus infectivity, we demonstrate a clear relationship between Ct values, quantitative culture of infectious virus and antigen LFD positivity in clinical samples. Our data support regular testing of target groups using LFDs to supplement the current PCR testing capacity, to rapidly identify infected individuals in situations where they would otherwise go undetected.

In the United States, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were first administered to the public starting in December 2020, and no lactating women were included in the initial trials of safety/efficacy. Research on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in lactating women and the potential transmission of passive immunity to the infant through breast milk is needed to guide patients, clinicians and policy makers during the worldwide effort to curb the spread of this virus.

ObjectiveTo determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobins are found in breast milk post-vaccination, and to characterize the time course and types of immunoglobulins present.

DesignProspective cohort study

SettingProvidence Portland Medical Center, Oregon, USA

ParticipantsSix lactating women who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine between December 2020 and January 2021. Breast milk samples were collected pre-vaccination and at 11 additional timepoints, with last sample at 14 days post 2nd dose of vaccine.

442,Introductions and evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Japan,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Japan on January 15th, 2020, soon after the pandemic originated in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, Japan experienced three distinct waves of the outbreak in the span of a year and has been attributed to new exogenous strains and evolving existing strains. Japan engaged very early on in tracking different COVID-19 sub-strains and have sequenced approximately 5% of all confirmed cases. While Japan has enforced stringent airport surveillance on cross-border travelers and returnees, some carriers appear to have advanced through the quarantine stations undetected. In this study, 17112 genomes sampled in Japan were analyzed to understand the strains, heterogeneity and temporal evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 strains. We identified 11 discrete strains with a substantial number of cases with most strains possessing the spike (S) D614G and nucleocapsid (N) 203_204delinsKR mutations. Besides these variants, ORF1ab P3371S, A4815V, S1361P, and N P151L were also detected in nearly half the samples constituting the most common strain in Japan. 115 distinct strains have been introduced into Japan and 12 of them were introduced after strict quarantine policy was implemented. In particular, the B.1.1.7 strain, that emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in September 2020, has been circulating in Japan since late 2020 after eluding cross-border quarantine stations. Similarly, the B.1.351 strain dubbed the South African variant, P.1 Brazilian strain and R.1 strain with the spike E484K mutation have been detected in Japan. At least four exogenous B.1.1.7 sub-strains have been independently introduced in Japan as of late January 2021, and these strains carry mutations that give selective advantage including N501Y, H69_V70del, and E484K that confer increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy to vaccines and possible increased virulence. It is imperative that the quarantine policy be revised, cross-border surveillance reinforced, and new public health measures implemented to mitigate further transmission of this deadly disease and to identify strains that may engender resistance to vaccines.",Reitaro Tokumasu; Dilhan Weeraratne; Jane Snowdon; Laxmi Parida; Michiharu Kudo; Takahiko Koyama,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252555,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252555,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
443,Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients in two successive pandemic waves,"RationaleThe progress of COVID-19 from moderate to severe may be precipitous, while the heterogenous characteristics of the disease pose challenges to the management of these patients.

ObjectivesTo characterize the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 during two successive waves.

MethodsWe leveraged the multi-center SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19 (SPARCOL) study and collected data from consecutive patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit from April 1st to November 30th, 2020.

Measurements and Main ResultsOf 252 patients, 81 (32%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Of them, 17 (20.9%) were intubated during the first wave, while 64 (79%) during the second wave. The most prominent difference between the two waves was the overall survival (first wave 58.9% vs. second wave 15.6%, adjusted p-value=0.006). This difference is reflected in the prolonged hospitalization during the first wave. The mean ICU length of stay (19.1 vs. 11.7 days, p=0.022), hospital length of stay (28.5 vs. 17.1 days, p=0.012), and days on ventilator (16.7 vs. 11.5, p=0.13) were higher during the first wave. A significant difference between the two waves was the development of bradycardia. In the first wave, 2 (11.7%) patients developed sinus bradycardia only after admission to the intensive care unit, while in the second wave, 63 (98.4%) patients developed sinus bradycardia during hospitalization.

ConclusionsSurvival of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower during the second wave. The majority of these patients developed sinus bradycardia during hospitalization.",Athanasios Chalkias; Ioannis Pantazopoulos; Nikolaos Papagiannakis; Anargyros Skoulakis; Eleni Laou; Konstantina Kolonia; Nicoletta Ntalarizou; Dimitrios Ragias; Christos Kampolis; Luis Garcia de Guadiana Romualdo; Konstantinos Tourlakopoulos; Athanasios Pagonis; Salim S Hayek; Jesper Eugen-Olsen; Konstantinos Gourgoulianis; Eleni Arnaoutoglou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21251848,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21251848,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
444,Utility of a Clinical Scoring System for Point of Care Triaging in COVID-19 Pneumonia,"BackgroundSurges in COVID-19 disease cases can rapidly overwhelm healthcare resources; triaging to appropriate levels of care can assist in resource planning. At the beginning of the pandemic, we developed a simple triage tool, the Temple COVID-19 Pneumonia Triage Tool (TemCOV) based on a combination of clinical and radiographic features that are readily available on presentation to categorize and predict illness severity.

MethodsWe prospectively examined 579 sequential cases admitted to Temple University Hospital who were assigned severity categories on admission. Our primary outcome was to compare the performance of TemCOV in predicting patients who have the highest likely of admission to the ICU at 24 and at 72 hours to other standard triage tools: the National Early Warning System (NEWS), the Modified Early Warning System (MEWS) and the CURB65 score. Additional endpoints included need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 72 hours, total hospital admission charges, and mortality.

Results26% of patients fell within our highest risk Category 4 and were more likely to require ICU admission at 24 hours (OR 11.51) and 72 hours (OR 8.6). Additionally they had the highest likelihood of needing IMV (OR 29.47) and in-hospital mortality (OR 2.37)., TemCOV performed similar to MEWS in predicting ICU admission at 24 hours (receive operator characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) 0.77 vs. 0.74, p=0.21) but better than NEWS2 and CURB65 (ROC AUC 0.77 vs. 0.69 and 0.77 vs. 0.64, respectively, p<0.01). While all severity scores had a weak correlation to hospital charges, the TemCOV performed the best among all severity scores measured (r=0.18); median hospital charges for Category 4 patients was $170,468 ($96,972-$487,556).

ConclusionTemCOV is a simple triage score that can be used upon hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 that predicts the need for hospital resources such as ICU bed capacity, invasive mechanical ventilation and personnel staffing.",Andrew J Gangemi; Rohit Gupta; Gustavo Fernandez-Romero; Huaqing Zhao; Maulin Patel; Junad Chowdhury; Massa Zantah; Matthew Zheng; Osheen Abramian; Stephen Codella; Linda Vien; Eduardo Dominguez-Castillo; Timothy Buckey; Charles Earley; Jourdan Frankovich; Mali Jurkowski; Zachary Jurkowski; Nanzhou Guo; Paige Stanley; Brenton Halsey; Jasleen Kahlon; Navjot Kaur; Roman Prosniak; Maruti Kumaran; Chandra Dass; David Fleece; Michael R Jacobs; Gerard J Criner; - Temple University COVID-19 Research Group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252256,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252256,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
445,Seasonal patterns COVID-19 and Flu Like Illnesses comparable,"IntroductionDuring the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality, such as other respiratory viral infections since time immemorial, including earlier respiratory pandemics. It has already been observed that the COVID-19 community outbreaks appear to have a similar pattern as other influenza like illnesses (ILI). One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19.

MethodsWe gather and calculated the average ILI annual time series based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands. And, compared this with two independent COVID-19 time series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands, plotted on a logarithmic infection scale. We tested our hypothesis by calculating correlation coefficients and, as a sensitivity analysis, by performing univariate regression analysis.

ResultsThe COVID-19 time series strongly and highly significantly correlates with the ILI time series r(45) = 0.75 (p < 0.00001) and (r(45) = 0.798, p < 0.00001). Also the univariate regression analyses that we performed as a sensitivity analysis are all highly significant: respectively F(1, 43) = 61.45, p < 0.0001, and F(1, 43) = 81.18, p < 0.0001 and the correlations (r2) are moderate to strong.

ConclusionsGiven the strong, and highly significant, correlations between the ILI and COVID-19 time series, we conclude that COVID-19 behaves as seasonal as ILI in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Moreover, the COVID-19 peaks are all during flu season, and lows are all in the opposing period as expected. Furthermore, the COVID-19 time series satisfies the two characteristics of earlier pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season.",Martijn J Hoogeveen; Ellen K Hoogeveen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252625,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252625,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
446,Unmasking the Current Scenario of Indian Biomedical Devices Industry: Ventilators being the Heart of the Discussion,"BackgroundThe Indian Biomedical Device Industry has been growing at an unprecedented rate, but several hindrances need to be acknowledged in offering access to quality, budget-friendly medical devices in India. This article explores the current loopholes of the Indian biomedical device industry along with the proposal of various innovative solutions, with emphasis on ventilators.

MethodsAn online survey with the help of Google forms was conducted from 1st November to 25th December 2020, addressing the problems of the Indian medical device industry (MDI) along with probable solutions. The survey also provides a glimpse into the complications aroused from the frequent use of ventilators during COVID-19 outburst, along with possible measures.

ResultsAccording to the survey, 51.6%, 46.5%, 55.7%, and 47.5% of respondents have agreed to  Stringent laws and implementation,  Safety testing and strict regulations,  Unfavorable duty structure, and  Reducing tax rate on domestic manufacturers, as a possible solution to advance the implementation of ISO 13485 and ISO 10651, implementation of ISO 14971, the probable cause of limitations of Indian MDI, possible measure to overcome limitations of Indian MDI, respectively. 46.7%, 47.5%, 46.2%, and 44.6% of respondents have agreed to  Surgical decompression,  Nebulized and broad-spectrum antibiotics,  PEEP, and  Adopting lung protective ventilation strategies as possible solutions to treat various ventilator complications, respectively.

ConclusionThe study briefs about the peoples perception of the Indian MDI as well as on the ventilator complications.

447,"Sequence Analysis of 20,453 SARS-CoV-2 Genomes from the Houston Metropolitan Area Identifies the Emergence and Widespread Distribution of Multiple Isolates of All Major Variants of Concern","[Abstract]Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been international concern about the emergence of virus variants with mutations that increase transmissibility, enhance escape from the human immune response, or otherwise alter biologically important phenotypes. In late 2020, several ""variants of concern"" emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California ""variants of interest"" (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility capacity. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Based on our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 virus specimens from COVID-19 patients dating from March 2020, we report identification of all important SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States to have all variants documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates worldwide, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence and frequency of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination. This information is critical for medical and public health efforts to effectively address and mitigate this global crisis.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

448,"The prevalence, incidence and risk factors of mental health problems and mental health services use before and 9 months after the COVID-19 outbreak among the general Dutch population. A 3-wave prospective study.","ObjectivesGain insight in the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence, the incidence and risk factors of mental health problems among the Dutch general population and different age groups in November-December 2020, compared to the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors in the same period in 2018 and 2019. More specifically, the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of anxiety and depression symptoms, sleep problems, fatigue, disabilities due to health problems, use of medicines for sleep problems, medicines for anxiety and depression, and mental health services use.

MethodsWe extracted data from the LISS (Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences) panel that is based a probability sample of the Dutch population of 16 years and older by Statistics Netherlands. We used three waves of the longitudinal Health module held in November-December 2018 (T1), November-December 2019 (T2) and November-December 2020 (T3), and selected respondents who were 18 years and older at T1. Data were weighted using 16 demographics profiles of the Dutch adult population (Nstudy sample=4,064). The course of mental health problems was examined with repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses, and the differences in incidence with multivariate logistic regression analyses. In both types of analyses, we controlled for sex, age, marital status, employment status, education level and physical disease.

ResultsThe repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses among the total study sample did not reveal a significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, sleep problems, fatigue, disabilities due to health problems, use of medicines for sleep problems, medicines for anxiety and depression, and mental health services use in November- December 2020, compared to November-December 2018 and 2019 (that is, T3 did not differ from T1 and T2). Among the four different age categories (18-34, 35-49, 50-64, and 65 years old and older respondents), 50-64 years respondents had a significantly lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms at T3 than at T1 and T2, while T1 and T2 did not differ. A similar pattern among 65+ respondents was found for mental health services use. We found no indications that the incidence of examined health problems at T2 (no problem at T1, problem at T2) and T3 (no problem at T2, problem at T3) differed. Risk factors for mental health problems at T2 were mostly similar to risk factors at T3; sex and age were less associated with sleep problems at T3, compared to T2 .

ConclusionsThe prevalence, incidence and risk factors of examined mental health problems examined nine months after the COVID-19 outbreak appear to be very stable across the end of 2018, 2019 and 2020 among the Dutch adult population and different age categories, suggesting that the Dutch adult population (20 years and older) in general is rather resilient given all disruptions due to this pandemic.",Peter G van der Velden; Miquelle Marchand; Marcel Das; Ruud Muffels; Mark Bosmans,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21251952,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21251952,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
449,"Modelled Optimization of SARS-Cov-2 Vaccine Distribution: an Evaluation of Second Dose Deferral Spacing of 6, 12, and 24 weeks","BackgroundMultiple recent studies have shown strong first dose vaccine efficacy for both Moderna mRNA-1273 and Pfizer/BioNTech BNT 162b2, which has stimulated discussion of maximizing initial population immunity during a time of vaccine shortage by using a deferred second dose strategy for these vaccines.

MethodsOur model examines the size of the effect of spacing of the second dose with 6, 12, and 24 week deferred spacing regimens relative to 3 week spacing.

ResultsDeferring the second dose from 3 weeks to 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks shows progressive benefit to population immunity for any given time period, even with significant one dose efficacy decay. The benefits are influenced by vaccine supply per capita.

ConclusionThe longer the second dose is deferred the larger the benefit in initial population immunity, provided one dose efficacy does not significantly wane. Monitoring one dose efficacy duration from the UK or Quebec minimizes this risk, as the gathered data will help ensure the second dose is given at an optimal time. How this information is implemented should vary depending on the population and whether the goal is to optimally protect high risk groups or to increase total population immunity as quickly as possible. Benefits to deferring the second dose are influenced by the length of deferral, one dose efficacy, and vaccine supply per capita. The time to herd immunity could be shortened by 4 weeks with the implementation of a 12 week spacing regimen or 10 weeks with a 24 week spacing regimen.",Graham Jurgens; Kyle Lackner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252638,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252638,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
450,A new accessible adaptable COVID-19 model,"ObjectivesSophisticated epidemic models have been created to help governments and large healthcare organisations plan the necessary resources to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst helpful, current modelling systems are not widely accessible or easily adapted to different populations and circumstances. Our objective was to develop a widely applicable, easily accessible, adaptable model for projecting new COVID-19 infections and deaths that requires minimal expertise or resources to use. The model should be adaptable to different populations and able to accommodate social and pharmaceutical interventions as well as changes in the disease.

DesignA Susceptible, Infected and Removed (SIR) infectious disease model was created using widely available Microsoft Excel(C) software. The model is deterministic, generating projections based on the available data and assumptions made. It uses a process of Monitored Forecasting through Visual Matching of predicated vs observed curves to improve accuracy and facilitate adaptability. A review of the COVID-19 literature was performed in order to produce an initial set of adjustable parameters on which to base the output of the model.

SettingThis model can be adapted to different regions or countries for which the requisite input data (population size and number of deaths due to the disease) are available. This model has been successfully used with data from England, Sudan and Saudi Arabia. Data from NHS England were used for producing the illustrative results presented here. The model is a generic infectious disease forecast model which may be adapted to other epidemics.

InterventionGovernments, public health organisations, pharmaceutical companies and other public institutions may introduce interventions that affect disease transmission or severity. Other unknown factors such as new variants of the infective agent may do the same. The effects of changes in disease transmission are identified by the model when predicted and observed curves deviate. By aligning the curves an evaluation of the effect of the changes can be made.

Outcome MeasuresThe model graphically demonstrates projections for daily deaths, cumulative deaths, case mix (asymptomatic, symptomatic and severe infections requiring admission), hospital admissions and bed occupancy (ICU, general medical and total).

ResultsThe model successfully produced projections for the outcome measures using NHS England data. Users can adapt and continuously update the model correcting its projections as further local data becomes available. The Microsoft Excel platform allows the model to be used without expensive health information systems or computing infrastructure.

ConclusionWe present an SIR epidemic model that projects COVID-19 disease progression, is widely accessible, adaptable to different populations and environments as the disease progresses and is likely to be of benefit for identifying changing population healthcare needs.",Michael G Baker; Maximilian de Courten; David A Sidloff; Alexander DL Baker; Walid S El Sayes; Faisal A Alaklobi; Abdulrahman S Alqahtani; Edward Fraser; Charles R Cohen; Isam SM Osman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252633,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252633,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
451,Shifting research priorities in maternal and child health in the COVID-19 pandemic era in India: a renewed focus on systems strengthening,"BackgroundThe remarkable progress seen in maternal and child health (MCH) in India over the past two decades has been impacted by setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to undertake a rapid assessment to identify key priorities for public health research in MCH in India within the context and aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA web-based survey was developed to identify top research priorities in MCH. It consisted of 26 questions on six broad domains: vaccine preventable diseases, outbreak preparedness, primary healthcare integration, maternal health, neonatal health, and infectious diseases. Key stakeholders were invited to participate between September and November 2020. Participants assigned importance on a 5-point Likert scale, and assigned overall ranks to each sub-domain research priority. Descriptive statistics were used to examine Likert scale responses, and a ranking analysis was done to obtain an ""average ranking score"" and identify the top research priority under each domain.

ResultsAmongst the 84 respondents, 37% were public-health researchers, 25% healthcare providers, 20% academic faculty and 13% were policy makers. Across the six domains, most respondents considered conducting research on systems strengthening as extremely important. The highest ranked research priorities were strengthening the public sector workforce (vaccine preventable diseases), enhancing public-health surveillance networks (outbreak preparedness), nutrition support through community workers (primary care integration), encouraging at least 4-8 antenatal visits (maternal health), neonatal resuscitation to reduce birth asphyxia (neonatal health) and pediatric and maternal screening and treatment of tuberculosis (infectious diseases). Common themes identified through open-ended questions were also systems strengthening priorities across domains.

ConclusionsThe overall focus for research priorities in MCH in India during the COVID-19 pandemic is on strengthening existing services and service delivery, rather than novel research.

452,"Early effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector vaccine on symptomatic disease, hospitalisations and mortality in older adults in England","ObjectivesTo estimate the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine and Astrazeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine against Confirmed COVID-19, hospitalisations and deaths. To estimate effectiveness on the UK variant of concern.

DesignTest negative case control design

SettingCommunity COVID-19 PCR testing in England

ParticipantsAll adults in England aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million). All COVID-19 testing in the community among eligible individuals who reported symptoms between 8th December 2020 and 19th February 2021 was included in the analysis.

InterventionsOne and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. One dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine.

Main outcome measuresSymptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19.

ResultsIndividuals aged >=80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 prior to 4th January, had a higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore estimated relative to the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 59-78%) from 28-34 days, then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccine effectiveness of 89% (95%CI: 85-93%) was seen.

Individuals aged >=70 years vaccinated from 4th January had a similar underlying risk of COVID-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (95%CI 51-69%) from 28-34 days after vaccination then plateaued. With the ChAdOx1 vaccine, vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching an effectiveness of 60% (95%CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95%CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards.

On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of BNT162b2 had an additional 43% (95%CI 33-52%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation and an additional 51% (95%CI 37-62%) lower risk of death. Cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of ChAdOx1 had an additional 37% (95% CI 3-59%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation. There was insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality due to the later rollout of this vaccine. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, this indicates that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation and a single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death with COVID-19.

ConclusionVaccination with either a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. Both vaccines show similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease but second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England.

453,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among workers of the public higher education institutions of Porto, Portugal","ObjectivesTo assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies among workers of the three public higher education institutions of Porto, Portugal, up to July 2020.

MethodsA rapid point of care test for specific IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 was offered to all workers. Testing was performed to and a questionnaire was completed by 4592 workers on a voluntary basis. We computed the apparent IgM, IgG, and combined IgM or IgG prevalence, along with the true prevalence and 95% credible intervals (95% CI) using Bayesian inference.

ResultsWe found an apparent prevalence of 3.1% for IgM, 1.0% for IgG, and 3.9% for either antibody class. The estimated true prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI 0.1-4.3) for IgM, 0.6% (95% CI 0.0-1.3) for IgG and 2.5% (95% CI 0.1-5.3) for IgM or IgG. A SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis was reported by 21 (0.5%) workers, and of these, 90.5% had a reactive IgG result. Seroprevalence was higher among those reporting known contacts with confirmed cases, having been quarantined, having a previous molecular negative test, or having had symptoms.

ConclusionsThe seroprevalence among workers from the three public higher education institutions of Porto after the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was relatively low.

454,SARS-CoV-2 infection in households with and without young children: Nationwide cohort study,"BackgroundInfections with seasonally spreading human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are common among young children during winter months in the northern hemisphere, with immunological response lasting around a year. However, it is not clear whether recent household exposure to HCoVs reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsIn a nationwide cohort study we followed all adults in Denmark aged 18 to 60 years from February 27 to November 15, 2020. Hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection by number of young children aged ten months to five years living in the household were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for adult age, gender, and other potential confounders. In sensitivity analyses we investigated the effect of age of children in the household, number of children living outside of the household, and number of other adult household-members.

ResultsAmong 449,915 adults in Denmark living in households with young children, 5,761 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while among 2,629,821 adults without young children in their household, 33,788 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.09). Sensitivity analyses of age of children in the household, number of children living outside of the household, and number of additional adult household members found increasing number of children, and especially increasing number of older children, to substantially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsLiving in a household with young children was not associated with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby suggesting no strong preventive effect of recent exposure to HCoVs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Anders Husby; Giulia Corn; Tyra Grove Krause,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21250921,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21250921,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
455,Vaccine hesitancy and reasons for refusing the COVID-19 vaccination among the U.S. public: A cross-sectional survey,"ImportanceAlthough widespread vaccination will be the most important cornerstone of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical question remains as to how much of the United States population will accept it.

ObjectiveDetermine: 1) rate of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the United States public, 2) patient characteristics associated with hesitancy, 3) reasons for hesitancy, 4) healthcare sites where vaccine acceptors would prefer to be vaccinated.

Design43-question cross-sectional survey conducted November 17-18, 2020, distributed on Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online labor marketplace where individuals receive a nominal fee (here, $1.80) for anonymously completing tasks.

Eligible ParticipantsUnited States residents 18-88 years of age, excluding healthcare workers. A total 1,756 volunteer respondents completed the survey (median age 38 years, 53% female).

Main Outcome MeasureMultivariable logistic regression modeled the primary outcome of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (defined as non-acceptance or being unsure about acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine) with respondent characteristics.

ResultsA total 663 respondents (37.8%) were COVID-19 vaccine hesitant (374 [21.3%] non-acceptors and 289 [16.5%] unsure about accepting). Vaccine hesitancy was associated with not receiving influenza vaccination in the past 5 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.26-5.07, p<0.01), female gender (OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.70-2.65, p<0.01), Black race (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.05-2.26, p=0.03), having a high school education or less (OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.03-2.07, p=0.03), and Republican party affiliation (OR 2.41, 95%CI 1.88-3.10, p<0.01). Primary reasons for hesitancy were concerns about side effects, need for more information, and doubts about vaccine efficacy. Preferred sites for vaccination for acceptors were primary doctors offices/clinics, pharmacies, and dedicated vaccination locations.

ConclusionsIn this recent national survey, over one-third of respondents were COVID-19 vaccine hesitant. To increase vaccine acceptance, public health interventions should target vaccine hesitant populations with messaging that addresses their concerns about safety and efficacy.",Ali S Raja; Joshua D Niforatos; Nancy Anaya; Joseph Graterol; Robert M Rodriquez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252610,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252610,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
456,Optimal mobility restriction minimizing COVID-19 and excess suicide deaths in Japan,"BackgroundStrict countermeasures for COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdowns and voluntary restrictions against going out might have reduced mortality because of COVID-19 directly, but might have raised suicide rates.

ObjectWe examined best policies for minimizing overall mortality attributable to COVID-19 directly, and excess mortality by suicide because of COVID-19.

MethodWe regressed the estimated excess mortality attributable to suicide deaths against mobility-restrictive measures. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 directly was estimated through association between the effective reproduction number and mobility. We sought the best mobility restriction for minimizing overall deaths.

ResultsSignificant association was found between mobility and suicide, but the data were very few. Results showed the best mobility level as 65.5, which represents a 34.5% reduction in mobility from the normal level.

457,The impact of COVID-19 on primary health care and antibiotic prescribing in rural China: qualitative study,"IntroductionPrimary health care (PHC) system is designated to be responsible for epidemic control and prevention during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, while COVID-19 suspected cases in PHC are required to be transferred to specialist fever clinics at higher level hospitals. This study aims to understand to impact of COVID-19 on PHC delivery and antibiotic prescribing at community level in the rural areas of central China.

MethodsQualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 PHC practitioners and seven patients recruited from two township health centres (THCs) and nine village clinics (VCs) in two rural residential areas of Anhui province. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.

ResultsPractitioners and patients views and perspectives on COVID-19 impacts on PHC services and antibiotic prescribing are organised into four broad themes: switch from PHC to epidemic prevention and control, concerns and challenges faced by those delivering PHC, diminished PHC, and COVID-19 as a different class of illness.

ConclusionThe COVID-19 epidemic has had a considerable impact on the roles of rural PHC clinics in China that shifted to public health from principal medical, and highlighted the difficulties in rural PHC including inadequately trained practitioners, additional work and financial pressure, particularly in VCs. Antibiotic prescribing practices for non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infections remained unchanged since the knowledge of COVID-19 was not seen as relevant to practitioners antibiotic treatment practices, although overall rates were reduced because fewer patients were attending rural PHC clinics. Since COVID-19 epidemic control work has been designated as a long-term task in China, rural PHC clinics now face the challenge of how to balance their principal clinical and public health roles and, in the case of the VCs, remain financially viable.",Tingting Zhang; Xingrong Shen; Rong Liu; Linhai Zhao; Debin Wang; Helen Lambert; Christie Cabral,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252602,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252602,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
458,The Risks and Benefits of Providing HIV Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions including to health services. In the early response to the pandemic many countries restricted population movements and some health services were suspended or limited. In late 2020 and early 2021 some countries re-imposed restrictions. Health authorities need to balance the potential harms of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to contacts associated with health services against the benefits of those services, including fewer new HIV infections and deaths. This paper examines these trade-offs for select HIV services.

MethodsWe used four HIV simulation models (Goals, HIV Synthesis, Optima HIV and EMOD) to estimate the benefits of continuing HIV services in terms of fewer new HIV infections and deaths. We used three COVID-19 transmission models (Covasim, Cooper/Smith and a simple contact model) to estimate the additional deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health workers and clients. We examined four HIV services: voluntary medical male circumcision, HIV diagnostic testing, viral load testing and programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We compared COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021 with HIV deaths occurring now and over the next 50 years discounted to present value. The models were applied to countries with a range of HIV and COVID-19 epidemics.

ResultsMaintaining these HIV services could lead to additional COVID-19 deaths of 0.002 to 0.15 per 10,000 clients. HIV-related deaths averted are estimated to be much larger, 19 - 146 discounted deaths per 10,000 clients.

DiscussionWhile there is some additional short-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with providing HIV services, the risk of additional COVID-19 deaths is at least 100 times less than the HIV deaths averted by those services. Ministries of Health need to take into account many factors in deciding when and how to offer essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work shows that the benefits of continuing key HIV services are far larger than the risks of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",John Stover; Sherrie L Kelly; Edinah Mudimu; Dylan Green; Tyler Smith; Issac Taramusi; Loveleen Bansi-Matharu; Rowan Martin-Hughes; Andrew N Phillips; Anna Bershteyn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252663,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252663,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
459,Effect Monitoring and Insights from Vaccination program of Healthcare Workforce from a tertiary level hospital in India against SARS-CoV-2.,"The Oxford-Astra Zeneca COVID 19 vaccine (AZD1222 or ChAdOx1) is an important part of the global vaccine roll-out against SARS-CoV-2, and a locally manufactured version (Covishield by Serum Institute, Pune, India) is the most commonly used vaccine in India. The vaccination program started in January 2021 and here we report effectiveness of the first dose of Covishield in generating antibody response and its kinetics. We further report differences in the quantitative antibody response amongst individuals who had pre-existing antibodies to SARS CoV2 and those who did not. In a group of 135 healthcare workers administered Covishield, we measured antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 directed against the spike protein (S-antigen) using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S quantitative antibody detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) at days 0, 7, 14, and 28. In 44 subjects (32.5%) who had already developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at day 0 (before immunization), it was observed that antibody response was significantly higher at each time point, with the maximum increase seen between days 0 and 7. In contrast the sero-negative group (n=91) started developing antibody response only after 14 days or later. Three sero-negative individuals did not develop any antibody response even at day 28 of vaccination. It is noted that median antibody response at 28 days in seronegative subjects was similar to that of seropositive subjects at baseline (day 0) and was on a rising trajectory. Our data suggests that ChAdOx1 is highly immunogenic, particularly so where previous SARS CoV2 antibody-response is established. Given the high background seropositivity in India, this may be useful in determining optimal timing of the second dose during mass immunization within the constraints of vaccine supply and administration.",Rajat Ujjainiya; Akansha Tyagi; Viren Sardana; Salwa Naushin; Nitin Bhatheja; Kartik Kumar; Joydeb Barman; Satyartha Prakash; Rintu Kutum; Menka Loomba; Yukti Khanna; Chestha Walecha; Rizwan Ahmed; Ashutosh Yadav; Archana Bajaj; Gaurav Malik; Sahar Qureshi; Swati Waghdhare; Samreen Siddiqui; Kamal Krishan Trehan; Manju Mani; Rajiv Dang; Poonam Das; Pankaj Dougall; Monica Mahajan; Sandeep Buddhiraja; Anurag Agrawal; Debasis Dash; Sujeet Jha; Shantanu Sengupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252621,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252621,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
460,"Novel clinical subphenotypes in COVID-19: derivation, validation, prediction, temporal patterns, and interaction with social determinants of health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is heterogeneous and our understanding of the biological mechanisms of host response to the novel viral infection remains limited. Identification of meaningful clinical subphenotypes may benefit pathophysiological study, clinical practice, and clinical trials. Here, our aim was to derive and validate COVID-19 subphenotypes using machine learning and routinely collected clinical data, assess temporal patterns of these subphenotypes during the pandemic course, and examine their interaction with social determinants of health (SDoH). We retrospectively analyzed 14418 COVID-19 patients in five major medical centers in New York City (NYC), between March 1 and June 12, 2020. Using clustering analysis, four biologically distinct subphenotypes were derived in the development cohort (N = 8199). Importantly, the identified subphenotypes were highly predictive of clinical outcomes (especially 60-day mortality). Sensitivity analyses in the development cohort, and re-derivation and prediction in the internal (N = 3519) and external (N = 3519) validation cohorts confirmed the reproducibility and usability of the subphenotypes. Further analyses showed varying subphenotype prevalence across the peak of the outbreak in NYC. We also found that SDoH specifically influenced mortality outcome in Subphenotype IV, which is associated with older age, worse clinical manifestation, and high comorbidity burden. Our findings may lead to a better understanding of how COVID-19 causes disease in different populations and potentially benefit clinical trial development. The temporal patterns and SDoH implications of the subphenotypes may add new insights to health policy to reduce social disparity in the pandemic.",Chang Su; Yongkang Zhang; James H Flory; Mark G Weiner; Rainu Kaushal; Edward J Schenck; Fei Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252645,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252645,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
461,Distinct systemic and mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV-2,"Coordinated local mucosal and systemic immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection protect against COVID-19 pathologies or fail leading to severe clinical outcomes. To understand this process, we performed an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies, cytokines, viral load and 16S bacterial communities in paired nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples from a cohort of clinically distinct COVID-19 patients during acute infection. Plasma viral load was associated with systemic inflammatory cytokines that were elevated in severe COVID-19, and also with spike-specific neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, nasopharyngeal viral load correlated with SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses but inversely with interferon responses, the latter associating with protective microbial communities. Potential pathogenic microrganisms, often implicated in secondary respiratory infections, were associated with mucosal inflammation and elevated in severe COVID-19. Our results demonstrate distinct tissue compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses and highlight a role for the nasopharyngeal microbiome in regulating local and systemic immunity that determines COVID-19 clinical outcomes.",Nikaia Smith; Pedro Goncalves; Bruno Charbit; Ludivine Grzelak; Maxime Beretta; Cyril Planchais; Timothee Bruel; Vincent Rouilly; Vincent Bondet; jerome hadjadj; Nader Yatim; Helene Pere; Sarah Merkling; Solen Kerneis; Frederic Rieux-Leucat; Benjamin Terrier; Olivier Schwartz; Hugo Mouquet; Darragh Duffy; James Di Santo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21251633,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21251633,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
462,COVID-19 Related Chemosensory Changes in Individuals with Self-Reported Obesity,"Background/objectivesIndividuals with obesity show alterations in smell and taste abilities. Smell and taste loss are also the most prominent neurological symptoms of COVID-19, yet how chemosensory ability present in individuals with obesity with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis is unknown.

Subjects/MethodsIn this secondary analysis of a cross-sectional global dataset, we compared self-reported chemosensory ability in participants with a respiratory illness reporting a positive (C19+; n = 5156) or a negative (C19-; n = 659) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome, who also self-reported to be obese (C19+; n = 433, C19-; n = 86) or non-obese.

ResultsCompared to the C19- group, C19+ exhibited a greater decline in smell, taste, and chemesthesis during illness, though these symptoms did not differ between participants with obesity and without obesity. In 68% of participants who reported recovery from respiratory illness symptoms (n=3431 C19+ and n= 539 C19-), post-recovery chemosensory perception did not differ in C19+ and C19- diagnosis, and by self-reported obesity. Finally, we found that all chemosensory and other symptoms combined predicted the C19+ diagnosis in participants with obesity with a moderately good estimate (63% accuracy). However, in C19+ participants with obesity, we observed a greater relative prevalence of non-chemosensory symptoms, including respiratory as respiratory and GI symptoms.

ConclusionsWe conclude that despite a presumed lower sensitivity to chemosensory stimuli, COVID-19 respondents with obesity experience a similar self-reported chemosensory loss as those without obesity, and in both groups self-reported chemosensory symptoms are similarly predictive of COVID-19.",Surabhi Bhutani; Geraldine Coppin; Maria Geraldine Veldhuizen; Valentina Parma; Paule Valery Joseph,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252536,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252536,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
463,Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and increasing viral variants in children and young adults with impaired humoral immunity,"BackgroundThere is increasing concern that persistent infection of SARS-CoV-2 within immunocompromised hosts could serve as a reservoir for mutation accumulation and subsequent emergence of novel strains with the potential to evade immune responses.

MethodsWe describe three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were persistently positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viral viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape.

FindingsWe found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape.

InterpretationOur results highlight the need to reassess infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients. Routine surveillance of mutations and evaluation of their potential impact on viral transmission and immune escape should be considered.

464,Impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers at a cancer care centre,"BackgroundThe services of front-line health care workers (HCWs) have been paramount in the management of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Health care professionals have been at high occupational risk of getting disease and even dying of the disease, however; they have been the subject of very limited studies in terms of COVID-19. The objectives of this study are to examine the incidence and the impact of COVID-19 infection among HCWs in terms of recovery, productivity, quality of life (QOL) and post-COVID complications.

Materials and MethodsThis was a retrospective, questionnaire based study including demographic details, workplace characteristics, symptoms, source/ spread of infection, details of recovery and the consequences of COVID-19 comprising impaired productivity/ QOL, post-COVID-19 complications and others. The data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS software (Version 23, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results and ConclusionsOut of a total of 1482 employees, 18.3% (271) were laboratory confirmed to have contracted novel contagion during the study period of 5 months. The median age at diagnosis was 29 (range, 21-62) years. Front-line workers and female workers were the most infected personnel with COVID-19. Flu-like symptoms were the most frequently experienced symptoms. The median time for recovery was 20 (range, 2-150) days. The relationship between pre-existing comorbidities and age was highly significant. The QOL and productivity were associated with pre-existing comorbidities, severity of the disease, time for recovery and post-COVID syndrome. More than a half (51.8%) of all HCWs had suffered from post-COVID complications. There was no fatality reported due to COVID-19. The post-COVID complications were related to pre-existing comorbidities, severity of disease, time for recovery and status of recovery.

465,High-content screening of coronavirus genes for innate immune suppression revealsenhanced potency of SARS-CoV-2 proteins,"Suppression of the host intracellular innate immune system is an essential aspect of viral replication. Here, we developed a suite of medium-throughput high-content cell-based assays to reveal the effect of individual coronavirus proteins on antiviral innate immune pathways. Using these assays, we screened the 196 protein products of seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1 and MERS). This includes a previously unidentified gene in SARS-CoV-2 encoded within the Spike gene. We observe immune-suppressing activity in both known host-suppressing genes (e.g., NSP1, Orf6, NSP3, and NSP5) as well as other coronavirus genes, including the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 protein. Moreover, the genes encoded by SARS-CoV-2 are generally more potent immune suppressors than their homologues from the other coronaviruses. This suite of pathway-based and mechanism-agnostic assays could serve as the basis for rapid in vitro prediction of the pathogenicity of novel viruses based on provision of sequence information alone.",Erika J Olson; David M Brown; Timothy Z Chang; Lin Ding; Tai L Ng; H.

466,"High resolution profiling of MHC-II peptide presentation capacity, by Mammalian Epitope Display, reveals SARS-CoV-2 targets for CD4 T cells and mechanisms of immune-escape","Understanding the mechanisms of immune evasion is critical for formulating an effective response to global threats like SARS-CoV2. We have fully decoded the immune synapses for multiple TCRs from acute patients, including cognate peptides and the presenting HLA alleles. Furthermore, using a newly developed mammalian epitope display platform (MEDi), we determined that several mutations present in viral isolates currently expanding across the globe, resulted in reduced presentation by multiple HLA class II alleles, while some increased presentation, suggesting immune evasion based on shifting MHC-II peptide presentation landscapes. In support, we found that one of the mutations present in B1.1.7 viral strain could cause escape from CD4 T cell recognition in this way. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms more broadly, we used MEDi to generate a comprehensive analysis of the presentability of all SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the context of multiple common HLA class II molecules. Unlike other strategies, our approach is sensitive and scalable, providing an unbiased and affordable high-resolution map of peptide presentation capacity for any MHC-II allele.

467,Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and AS03 Adjuvant Induces Rapid Anamnestic Antibodies in the Lung and Protects Against Virus Challenge in Nonhuman Primates,"Adjuvanted soluble protein vaccines have been used extensively in humans for protection against various viral infections based on their robust induction of antibody responses. Here, soluble prefusion-stabilized spike trimers (preS dTM) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were formulated with the adjuvant AS03 and administered twice to nonhuman primates (NHP). Binding and functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that NHP developed AS03-dependent multi-functional humoral responses that targeted multiple spike domains and bound to a variety of antibody FC receptors mediating effector functions in vitro. Pseudovirus and live virus neutralizing IC50 titers were on average greater than 1000 and significantly higher than a panel of human convalescent sera. NHP were challenged intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose (3x106 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate). Two days post-challenge, vaccinated NHP showed rapid control of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Notably, vaccinated NHP also had increased spike-specific IgG antibody responses in the lung as early as 2 days post challenge. Moreover, vaccine-induced IgG mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge following passive transfer to hamsters. These data show that antibodies induced by the AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM vaccine are sufficient to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 and support the evaluation of this vaccine in human clinical trials.",Joseph R.

Here we describe a fragment-based method for the combinatorial design of antibody binding loops and their grafting onto antibody scaffolds. We designed and tested six single-domain antibodies targeting different epitopes on three antigens, including the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

470,Safety and Immunogenicity Evaluation of Inactivated whole-virus-SARS-COV-2 In Mice As Emerging Vaccine Development In Egypt,"The current worldwide pandemic COVID-19 is causing severe human health problems, with high numbers of mortality rates and huge economic burdens that require an urgent demand for safe, and effective and vaccine development. Our study was the first trail to development and evaluation of safety and immune response to inactivated whole SARS-COV-2 virus vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide. We used characterized SARS-COV-2 strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolates (SARS-CoV-2/human/EGY/Egy-SERVAC/2020) with accession numbers; MT981440; MT981439; MT981441; MT974071; MT974069 and MW250352 at GenBank that isolated from Egyptian patients SARS-CoV-2-positive. Development of the vaccine was carried out in a BSL - 3 facilities and the immunogenicity was determined in mice at two doses (55{micro}g and 100{micro}g per dose). All vaccinated mice were received a booster dose 14 days post first immunization. Our results demonstrated distinct cytopathic effect on the vero cell monolayers induced through SARS-COV-2 propagation and the viral particles were identified as Coronaviridae by transmission electron microscopy. SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR performed on the cell culture. Immunogenicity of the developed vaccine indicated the high antigen-binding and neutralizing antibody titers, regardless the dose concentration, with excellent safety profiles.However, no deaths or clinical symptoms in mice groups. The efficacy of the inactivated vaccine formulation was tested by wild virus challenge the vaccinated mice and detection of viral replication in lung tissues. Vaccinated mice recorded complete protection from challenge infection three weeks post second dose. SARS-COV-2 replication was not observed in the lungs of mice following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, regardless of the level of serum neutralizing antibodies.

472,Investigation of ventilation conditions associated with CO2 concentration changes in ultrasonographic exam room from the perspective of COVID-19 infection control,"ObjectivesVentilation is an important factor in preventing COVID-19 infection. To clarify the state of ventilation in ultrasonic exam rooms, as an index of ventilation rate, the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in our exam rooms was measured.

MethodsWe measured the CO2 concentration in each exam room before the examination and 0-15 minutes after end of the exam.

The subjects were 70 cases (abdomen: 24, breast: 16, neck: 16, and musculoskeletal: 14). In infant cases, one parent accompanied the patient during the examination.

ResultsThe highest CO2 concentration was 2261 ppm, observed after the breast examination. In all cases, the CO2 concentration in the exam room was highest immediately after the examination or two minutes after. Almost all cases had recovered to within 120% of the pre-examination CO2 concentrations within 15 minutes after the examination. The average CO2 concentration after ultrasonography was significantly higher for breast examinations than others.

ConclusionsEven in a hospital with modern ventilation equipment, the CO2 concentration in the ultrasound room was high after the exam and it takes 15 minutes to recover to the pre-exam state. Care must be taken to ensure adequate ventilation in ultrasonographic facilities.",Roka Namoto Matsubayashi; Shino Harada; Mitsuhiro Tominaga,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252598,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252598,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
473,Does Telemedicine Reduce health disparities? Longitudinal Evidence during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US,"ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic could be a significant health issue for the elderly population and those with pre-excising chronic condition. In response to the pandemic health care services have increased the use of telehealth medicine. The propose of this study is to examine factors associated with access to telemedicine before and after COVID-19 based on sociodemographic factors and type of chronic disease.

MethodWe have used data from the Research and Development Survey (RANDS) at two different time points Data collection for the first wave occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020 (n= 6786), second wave was between August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020 (n=5972). Three questions have been asked from the participant: 1) did the provider offer telemedicine before the pandemic? 2) does the provider offer telemedicine during the pandemic? And 3) have the participants schedule telemedicine appointments?

ResultIn both waves, 62 % of the participants reported providers did not have telemedicine services prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found a 22% increase in offering telemedicine in six first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. The finding shows almost no change in providing telemedicine between June and August. The data indicates just a 0.5% and 0.1% increase in accessing telemedicine, and scheduling in August than June, respectively. Patients older than 65 had higher access to telemedicine and had higher scheduling frequencies than other age groups, while they had the lowest access prior to the COVID-19. Blacks had the highest access to telemedicine services than other races (40%). Additionally, females, higher education, and living in metropolitan areas were associated with higher access and scheduling during the pandemic. There was a variation of access and scheduling in different chronic diseases, however, providers offered more remote services for those who diagnosed by diabetes.

ConclusionThe aim of telemedicine is to reduce disparities in healthcare access. The findings of this study show telemedicine has reduced racial disparities and provided greater accessibility for older groups. However, spatial and educational disparities are still noticeable. Research is necessary to examine how healthcare must address the socioeconomic heterogeneity in telemedicine by avoiding further disparities.",Ali Roghani; Samin Panahi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252330,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252330,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,True
474,High Initial Titres of Anti-Spike Antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 Infection is Associated with Faster Decay Rates at Four Months Follow-Up,"BackgroundDynamics of humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens following infection suggests an initial decay of antibody followed by subsequent stabilization. We aim to understand the longitudinal humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) protein and to evaluate their correlation to clinical symptoms among healthcare workers (HCW).

MethodsIn this cross-sectional longitudinal cohort study done in two phases over four months, HCW underwent serial qualitative serology testing for anti-N antibody, quantitative MSH-ELISA to detect Receptor Binding Domain and full-length S reactive antibodies and completed online surveys about COVID-19 related symptoms and healthcare/community exposure.

ResultsAnti-N antibody positivity was 27% and anti-S positivity was 28% in Phase 1. In Phase 2 anti-S titres were higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic positive subjects in Phase 1. Marginally higher titers were seen in asymptomatic compared to the symptomatic positive subgroup in Phase 2. A positive correlation was noted between age, number and duration of symptoms, and Phase 1 anti-S antibody titre. A strong correlation was observed between Phase 1 titers and decay of anti-S antibody titres between the two phases. Significant correlation with rate of decay was also noted with fever, GI symptoms, and total number and duration of COVID-19 symptoms.

ConclusionsHigher initial anti-S antibody titres were associated with larger number and longer duration of symptoms as well as faster decay during the two time points.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the decay rate of neutralizing antibodies among SARS-CoV-2 infected healthcare workers?

FindingsIn this cohort study that included 178 healthcare workers, over a 4-month period following the COVID-19 pandemic, participants had an initial rise in anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike (S) antibodies, which was followed by decay and stabilization of the titres. Significant correlation with rate of decay was noted with the symptomatic participants.

475,Cytoplasmic domain and enzymatic activity of ACE2 is not required for PI4KB dependent endocytosis entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic poses a global health emergency. Cellular entry of the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by its spike protein interacting with cellular receptor- human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we used lentivirus based pseudotypes bearing spike protein to demonstrate that entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphoinositides play essential role during this process. In addition, we showed that the intracellular domain and the catalytic activity of ACE2 is not required for efficient virus entry.

476,Performance evaluation of the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay,"BackgroundThe Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) has been developed for the in vitro quantitative detection of antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. We evaluated the performance of this assay using samples from seven sites in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

MethodsAnonymized frozen, residual serum, or plasma samples from blood donation centers or routine diagnostic testing were used for this study. For specificity and sensitivity analyses, presumed negative samples collected before October 2019 and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed single or sequential samples were tested, respectively. The performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay was also compared with other commercial immunoassays.

ResultsThe overall specificity (n=7880 pre-pandemic samples) and sensitivity (n=240 PCR-positive samples [[&ge;]14 days post-PCR]) for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay were 99.95% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 99.87-99.99) and 97.92% (95% CI: 95.21- 99.32), respectively. Compared with seven other immunoassays, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay had comparable or greater specificity and sensitivity. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay had significantly higher specificity compared with the LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, ADVIA Centaur(R) SARS-CoV-2 Total, ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG, iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays, and significantly higher sensitivity ([&ge;]14 days post-PCR) compared with the ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG, iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, and EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays.

477,Perturbation of ACE2 structural ensembles by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding,"The human ACE2 enzyme serves as a critical first recognition point of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the extracellular domain of ACE2 interacts directly with the S1 tailspike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virion through a broad protein-protein interface. Although this interaction has been characterized by X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM, these structures do not reveal significant differences in ACE2 structure upon S1 protein binding. In this work, using several all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show persistent differences in ACE2 structure upon binding. These differences are determined with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) machine learning method and validated using independent training and testing datasets, including long trajectories generated by D. E. Shaw Research on the Anton 2 supercomputer. In addition, long trajectories for 78 potent ACE2-binding compounds, also generated by D. E. Shaw Research, were projected onto the LDA classification vector in order to determine whether the ligand-bound ACE2 structures were compatible with S1 protein binding. This allows us to predict which compounds are ""apo-like"" vs ""complex-like"", as well as to pinpoint long-range ligand-induced allosteric changes of ACE2 structure.",Arzu Uyar; Alex Dickson,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.433608,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.433608,2021-03-02,2021-03-02,,False
478,COVID-19 International Border Surveillance Cohort Study at Toronto's Pearson Airport,"ObjectivesThe primary objective was to estimate the positivity rate of air travelers coming to Toronto, Canada in September and October, 2020, at arrival, day 7 and day 14. Secondary objectives were to estimate degree of risk based on country of origin; to assess knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 control measures; and subjective well-being during the quarantine period.

DesignProspective cohort of arriving international travelers.

SettingToronto Pearson Airport Terminal 1, Toronto, Canada.

ParticipantsPassengers arriving on international flights. Inclusion criteria were those aged 18 or older who had a final destination within 100 km of the airport; spoke English or French; and provided consent. Excluded were those taking a connecting flight; who had no internet access; who exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival; or who were exempted from quarantine.

Main outcome measuresPositive for SARS-CoV-2 virus on RT-PCR with self-administered nasal-oral swab, and general well-being using the WHO-5 index.

ResultsOf 16,361 passengers enrolled, 248 (1{middle dot}5%, 95% CI 1.3%,1.5%) tested positive. Of these, 167 (67%) were identified on arrival, 67 (27%) on day 7, and 14 (6%) on day 14. The positivity rate increased from 1% in September to 2% in October. Average well-being score declined from 19.8 (out of a maximum of 25) to 15.5 between arrival and day 7 (p<0.001).

ConclusionsA single arrival test will pick up two-thirds of individuals who will become positive, with most of the rest detected on the second test at day 7. These results support strategies identified through mathematical models that a reduced quarantine combined with testing can be as effective as a 14 day quarantine.

479,The negative consequences of failing to communicate uncertainties during a pandemic:The case of COVID-19 vaccines,"Uncertainties pervade our health choices, particularly in the context of a novel pandemic. Despite this, rather little is known about when and how to effectively communicate these uncertainties. The focus in the medical literature so far has been on how patients respond to mentions of uncertainty relating to diagnosis or treatment, showing that these can have detrimental effects on trust and satisfaction. On the other hand, how patients are affected by these communications over time, particularly in the face of conflicting information, has received little attention. This is particularly important in the context a novel pandemic where uncertainty is rife and information changes over time. To fill this gap, we conducted an online study with UK participants on hypothetical communications relating to COVID-19 vaccines. Participants first read a vaccine announcement, which either communicated with certainty or uncertainty, and then received information which conflicted with the announcement. Those who were exposed to the certain announcement reported a greater loss of trust and vaccination intention than those who were exposed to the uncertain announcement. This shows that communicating with unwarranted certainty can backfire in the long-term, whereas communicating uncertainties can protect people from the negative impact of exposure to conflicting information.",Eleonore Batteux; Bilovich Avri; Samuel G.

480,Covid-19 lockdown: Ethnic differences in childrens self-reported physical activity and the importance of leaving the home environment. A longitudinal and cross-sectional,"BackgroundIn England, the onset of COVID-19 and a rapidly increasing infection rate resulted in a lockdown (March-June 2020) which placed strict restrictions on movement of the public, including children. Using data collected from children living in a multi-ethnic city with high levels of deprivation, this study aimed to: (1) report childrens self-reported physical activity (PA) during the first COVID-19 UK lockdown and identify associated factors; (2) examine changes of childrens self-reported PA prior to and during the first UK lockdown.

MethodsThis study is part of the Born in Bradford (BiB) COVID-19 Research Study. PA (amended Youth Activity Profile), sleep, sedentary behaviours, daily frequency/time/destination/activity when leaving the home, were self-reported by 949 children (9-13 years). A sub-sample (n=634) also self-reported PA (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children) pre-pandemic (2017-February 2020). Univariate analysis assessed differences in PA between sex and ethnicity groups; multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with childrens PA. Differences in childrens levels of being sufficiently active were examined using the McNemar test examined change in PA prior to and during the lockdown, and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors explaining change.

ResultsDuring the pandemic, White British (WB) children were more sufficiently active (34.1%) compared to Pakistani Heritage children (PH) (22.8%) or  Other ethnicity children (O) (22.8%). WB children reported leaving the home more frequently and for longer periods than PH and O children. Modifiable variables related to being sufficiently active were frequency, duration, type of activity, and destination away from the home environment. There was a large reduction in children being sufficiently active during the first COVID-19 lockdown (28.9%) compared to pre-pandemic (69.4%).

ConclusionsPromoting safe extended periods of PA everyday outdoors is important for all children, in particular for children from ethnic minority groups. Childrens PA during the first COVID-19 UK lockdown has drastically reduced from before.

481,Opening schools and trends in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in European countries,"BackgroundIt is important to understand the role of schools in the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, bearing in mind that children and adolescents can spread the infection within families, even when their own symptoms are mild. The aim of this study was to examine the trends of contagion before and after schools reopened across 27 countries in the European Union.

MethodsAll data on the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 in each European country were collected from 20 days before schools reopened to 45 days afterwards. The Joinpoint regression method was used to detect single change points on the trend of contagion. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used for model selection purposes.

ResultsWe calculated 27 linear regression models for the daily case numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 27 countries from 20 days before schools reopened to 45 days afterwards. A significant increase in the number of daily infections was seen for 21 countries after a change point in the linear regression lines. The change points in different countries varied, ranging from 10 to 42 days after schools reopened, with the majority occurring beyond the 21st day.

ConclusionThis study analysed the trend of SARS-CoV-2 transmission before and after schools reopened in Europe. We observed a significant increase in the number of new daily cases in most countries. This issue poses a public health problem that needs to be taken into account in deciding strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19.",Alessandra Buja; Matteo Paganini; Vittorio Cristofori; Tatjana Baldovin; Riccardo Fusinato; Giovanna Boccuzzo; Silvia Cocchio; Silvia Coretti; Vincenzo Rebba; Maria Parpinel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252504,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252504,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
482,Surgical activity in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide observational cohort study,"ObjectivesTo report the volume of surgical activity and the number of cancelled surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design and settingAnalysis of electronic health record data from the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales.

MethodsWe used hospital episode statistics for all adult patients undergoing surgery between 1st January 2020 and 31st December 2020. We identified surgical procedures using a previously published list of procedure codes. Procedures were stratified by urgency of surgery as defined by NHS England. We calculated the deficit of surgical activity by comparing the expected number of procedures from the years 2016-2019 with the actual number of procedures in 2020. We estimated the cumulative number of cancelled procedures by 31st December 2021 according patterns of activity in 2020.

ResultsThe total number of surgical procedures carried out in England and Wales in 2020 was 3,102,674 compared to the predicted number of 4,671,338. This represents a 33.6% reduction in the national volume of surgical activity. There were 763,730 emergency surgical procedures (13.4% reduction), compared to 2,338,944 elective surgical procedures (38.6% reduction). The cumulative number of cancelled or postponed procedures was 1,568,664. We estimate that this will increase to 2,358,420 by 31st December 2021.

ConclusionsThe volume of surgical activity in England and Wales was reduced by 33.6% in 2020, resulting in over 1,568,664 cancelled operations. This deficit will continue to grow in 2021.

483,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive function in Japanese community-dwelling older adults in a class for preventing cognitive decline,"We examined the effects of lifestyle and thoughts on cognitive function and change in cognitive function due to restrictions in daily life during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive decline. This was a retrospective case-control study. The participants were 88 older adults with mild cognitive decline who participated in a class designed to help prevent cognitive decline. The class was suspended from early-March to end of May 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and resumed in June 2020. We collected demographic and cognitive function test data (Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale [TDAS]) before and after class suspension and questionnaire data on their lifestyle and thoughts during the suspension. Change in TDAS scores from before and after the suspension was used to divide the participants into decline (2 or more points worsening) and non-decline (all other participants) groups, with 16 (18.2%) and 72 (81.8%) participants in each group, respectively. A logistic regression model showed that the odds ratio (OR) for cognitive decline was lower in participants whose responses were ""engaged in hobbies"" (OR = 0.07, p = 0.015), ""worked on a worksheet about cognitive training provided by the town hall"" (OR = 0.19, p = 0.026), and ""had conversations over the phone"" (OR = 0.28, p = 0.0495). There was a significant improvement in TDAS scores after class was resumed (p < 0.01). A proactive approach to intellectual activities and social ties may be important for the prevention of cognitive decline during periods of restrictions due to COVID-19. We found that cognitive function test scores before class suspension significantly improved after resuming classes.

They often have atypical presentations of the disease without respiratory symptoms, which makes early diagnosis clinically challenging. We aimed to compare the baseline characteristics, presentation, and disease course of older and younger patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

MethodsThe charts of 429 consecutive patients hospitalized in Montreal, Canada, with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline health, presentation, in-hospital complications, and outcomes were recorded. Desegregation by age was performed to compare older ([&ge;]70) versus younger (<70) individuals.

ResultsOlder patients presented with more comorbidities compared to younger patients as captured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (mean 6 vs 2), including higher rates of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, chronic obstructive pulmonary, and chronic kidney disease. Older patients were less likely than younger patients to present with cough (27% vs 47%) or dyspnea (33% vs 48%). Fifty-two (52%) had no respiratory symptoms on presentation compared to 32% in the younger group (p<0.001); however, they were more likely to present with geriatric syndromes such as delirium (29% vs 7%), functional decline (14% vs 0.6%), or falls (15% vs 5%). Twelve (12%) of older patients presented with a geriatric syndrome as their sole symptom compared to 3% in the younger group (p=0.002). Older adults were more likely to develop acute kidney injury (35% vs 22%), malnutrition (9% vs 4%), delirium (29% vs 17%) and hypernatremia (32% vs 17%). They had higher in-hospital mortality (33% vs 13%, p<0.001).

DiscussionOlder adults presenting to hospital with COVID-19 commonly have no respiratory symptoms and can present with only a geriatric syndrome. A new geriatric syndrome in an older person should trigger isolation and evaluation for COVID-19. Furthermore, older adults are particularly vulnerable to complications related to dehydration, warranting early initiation of multidisciplinary care.",Sandrine Couture; Marc-Antoine Lepage; Claire Godard-Sebillotte; Nadia Sourial; Catherine Talbot-Hamon; Richard Kremer; Ami Grunbaum,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252596,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252596,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
485,Factors Associated with Serious Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan,"ImportanceThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have a negative impact on mental health of the population, leading to higher suicide rates, in many countries. However, little is known about risk factors associated with worsened mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo investigate the factors associated with serious psychological distress (SPD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA cross-sectional study using a large-scale internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan.

ExposuresDemographics (age, gender, marital status, family composition, and caregiving burden), socio-economic status (income level, employment type, educational attainment), the experience of domestic violence (DV), the state of emergency, fear of COVID-19, and stigma related to COVID-19.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresPrevalence of SPD, defined as Kessler 6 scale score [&ge;]13.

ResultsAmong 25,482 individuals included in this study, 2,556 (10%) met the criteria of SPD. Overall, women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.59; 95%CI, 1.17-2.16; P=0.003), ages 15-29 (aOR compared with ages 45-59, 2.35; 95%CI, 1.64-3.38; P<0.001), low income (aOR compared with intermediate income, 1.70; 95%CI, 1.16-2.49; P=0.007), providing caregiving to family members (aOR, 5.48; 95%CI, 3.51-8.56; P<0.001), experiencing DV (aOR, 5.72; 95%CI, 3.81-8.59; P<0.001), and fear of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.55-2.48; P<0.001) were associated with a higher rate of SPD. Among women aged 15-29 years, who experienced the highest rate of SPD, caregiving, DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were associated with a higher rate of SPD; whereas economic situation (income level and employment type) and social isolation (marital status) were not associated with the prevalence of SPD.

Conclusions and RelevanceEconomic situation, caregiving burden, DV, and fear of COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among young women--who have a higher risk of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan--similar factors, except economic situation, were associated with a higher rate of SPD.

486,Prioritizing the first doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to save the elderly: the case study of Italy,"Many countries are currently facing high mortality caused by the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 among the elderly not yet vaccinated. Vaccine shortage poses relevant challenges to health authorities, called to act in a timely manner, and with scarcity of vaccine, and data. We have developed a model for estimating the impact of vaccination on the mortality of the elderly following a schedule of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that prioritize first dose administration, as alternative to the standard schedule of two doses administered 3 to 4 weeks apart. We studied the Italian scenario, considering it representative of other Countries facing similar conditions in terms of virus circulation, mortality, and vaccine shortage, in the period from February, 10 to April, 14 2021. Under different conditions of quantity of vaccine administration, the schedule prioritizing first doses showed always significant increase of protected individuals, and a decrease of deaths, up to 19.8% less than the standard schedule. These findings support the vaccination option of prioritizing first dose in the elderly until vaccine supplies are adequate.",Giuseppe Pontrelli; Giulio Cimini; Marco Roversi; Andrea Gabrielli; Gaetano Salina; Stefania Bernardi; Francesca Rocchi; Alessandra Simonetti; Carlo Giaquinto; Paolo Rossi; Francesco Sylos Labini,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252538,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252538,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
487,"Povidone iodine, hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine mouthwashes reduce SARS-CoV2 burden in whole mouth fluid and respiratory droplets","SARS-CoV2 is transmitted primarily through oral mouth secretions and respiratory droplets. Commercial mouthwashes, povidone iodine (PI), hydrogen peroxide (HP) and chlorhexidine (CHX) have been tested in cell culture and RT-PCR studies for their efficacy to reduce SARS-CoV2 burden. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV2 burden in whole mouth fluid (WMF) and respiratory droplets (RD) samples before and after the use of PI, HP or CHX mouthwashes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using RT-PCR and rapid antigen test (RAT). Thirty-six SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR-positive in-patients were randomly assigned to one of the four groups: 20 and 60 minutes after 1% w/v PI or 1.5% HP; 90 and 180 minutes after 1.5% HP or 0.2% w/v CHX. WMF and RD samples were collected concurrently at baseline and after the two different time points. RD (92%) showed a higher reduction in SARS-CoV2 burden than WMF samples (50%; p=0.008). SARS-CoV2 burden was statistically lower at both 20 minutes (p=0.02) and 60 minutes (p=0.03) with PI; at 20 minutes with HP (p=0.0001); and 90 minutes with CHX (p=0.04). The overall and individual mean logarithmic reductions in the WMF and RD samples were greater than 1.0 at 20, 60 and 90 minutes after PI, HP or CHX. RAT-positive patients at 90 minutes post-treatment (n=3) demonstrated a one log increase in virus copies. Among the three RAT-negative post-treatment patients, SARS-CoV2 burden declined by one log in two while the third patient had a slight increase in RNA copies. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that the mouthwashes, PI, HP and CHX can reduce the SARS-CoV2 burden in the concurrently collected RD and WMF samples. RAT is more appropriate than RT-PCR to evaluate the efficacy of the mouthwashes.",Bagavad Gita Jayaraman; Gunaseelan Rajan; Priya Kannian; Chandra Lavanya; Krittika Ravichandran; Nagalingeswaran Kumarasamy; Kannan Ranganathan; Veeraraghavan Ashwini; Pasuvaraj Mahanathi; Stephen J Challacombe; Jennifer Webster-Cyriaque; Newell W Johnson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252488,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252488,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
488,REACT-2 Round 5: increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies demonstrate impact of the second wave and of vaccine roll-out in England,"BackgroundEngland has experienced high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting in particular minority ethnic groups and more deprived communities. A vaccination programme began in England in December 2020, with priority given to administering the first dose to the largest number of older individuals, healthcare and care home workers.

MethodsA cross-sectional community survey in England undertaken between 26 January and 8 February 2021 as the fifth round of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) programme. Participants completed questionnaires, including demographic details and clinical and COVID-19 vaccination histories, and self-administered a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There were sufficient numbers of participants to analyse antibody positivity after 21 days from vaccination with the PfizerBioNTech but not the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine which was introduced slightly later.

ResultsThe survey comprised 172,099 people, with valid IgG antibody results from 155,172. The overall prevalence of antibodies (weighted to be representative of the population of England and adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity) in England was 13.9% (95% CI 13.7, 14.1) overall, 37.9% (37.2, 38.7) in vaccinated and 9.8% (9.6, 10.0) in unvaccinated people. The prevalence of antibodies (weighted) in unvaccinated people was highest in London at 16.9% (16.3, 17.5), and higher in people of Black (22.4%, 20.8, 24.1) and Asian (20.0%, 19.0, 21.0) ethnicity compared to white (8.5%, 8.3, 8.7) people. The uptake of vaccination by age was highest in those aged 80 years or older (93.5%). Vaccine confidence was high with 92.0% (91.9, 92.1) of people saying that they had accepted or intended to accept the offer. Vaccine confidence varied by age and ethnicity, with lower confidence in young people and those of Black ethnicity. Particular concerns were identified around pregnancy, fertility and allergies. In 971 individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the proportion testing positive was high across all age groups. Following a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after 21 days or more, 84.1% (82.2, 85.9) of people under 60 years tested positive (unadjusted) with a decreasing trend with increasing age, but high responses to a single dose in those with confirmed or suspected prior COVID at 90.1% (87.2, 92.4) across all age groups.

ConclusionsThere is uneven distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population with a higher burden in key workers and some minority ethnic groups, similar to the pattern in the first wave. Confidence in the vaccine programme is high overall although it was lower in some of the higher prevalence groups which suggests the need for improved communication about specific perceived risks. Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or a single dose following previous infection, confers high levels of antibody positivity across all ages. Further work is needed to understand the relationship between antibody positivity, clinical outcomes such as hospitalisation, and transmission.",Helen Ward Professor; Graham Cooke Professor; Matthew Whitaker Mr; Rozlyn Redd Dr; Oliver Eales Mr; Jonathan Brown Mr; Katharine Collet Ms; Emily Cooper Ms; Daunt Anna Dr; Jones Kathryn Dr; Moshe Maya Ms; Michelle Willicombe Dr; Sophie Day Professor; Christina Atchison Dr; Ara Darzi Professor; Christl A Donnelly Professor; Steven Riley Professor; Deborah Ashby Professor; Wendy S Barclay Professor; Paul Elliott Professor,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252512,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252512,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
489,Long-Term SARS-CoV-2-Specific Immune and Inflammatory Responses Across a Clinically Diverse Cohort of Individuals Recovering from COVID-19,"A detailed understanding of long-term SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses and their relationship to humoral immunity and markers of inflammation in diverse groups of individuals representing the spectrum of COVID-19 illness and recovery is urgently needed. Data are also lacking as to whether and how adaptive immune and inflammatory responses differ in individuals that experience persistent symptomatic sequelae months following acute infection compared to those with complete, rapid recovery. We measured SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, soluble markers of inflammation, and antibody levels and neutralization capacity longitudinally up to 9 months following infection in a diverse group of 70 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The participants had varying degrees of initial disease severity and were enrolled in the northern California Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort. Adaptive T cell responses remained remarkably stable in all participants across disease severity during the entire study interval. Whereas the magnitude of the early CD4+ T cell immune response is determined by the severity of initial infection (participants requiring hospitalization or intensive care), pre-existing lung disease was significantly associated with higher long-term SARS-CoV2-specific CD8+ T cell responses, independent of initial disease severity or age. Neutralizing antibody levels were strongly correlated with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T but not CD8+ T cell responses. Importantly, we did not identify substantial differences in long-term virus-specific T cell or antibody responses between participants with and without COVID-19-related symptoms that persist months after initial infection.",Michael J Peluso; Amelia N.

490,The accuracy of novel antigen rapid diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2: a living systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are increasingly being integrated in testing strategies around the world. Studies of the Ag-RDTs have shown variable performance. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the clinical accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of commercially available Ag-RDTs.

MethodsWe registered the review on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020225140). We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, medRvix and bioRvix, FINDdx) for publications up until December 11th, 2020. Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed and when more than four studies were available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity in comparison to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. We assessed heterogeneity by subgroup analyses ((1) performed con-form with manufacturers instructions for use (IFU) or not, (2) symptomatic vs. asymptomatic, (3) duration of symptoms less than seven days vs. more than seven days, (4) Ct-value <25 vs. <30 vs. [&ge;]30, (5) by sample type)) and with meta-regression. We assessed study quality and risk of bias using the QUADAS 2 assessment tool.

ResultsFrom a total of 11,715 articles, we extracted 98 analytical and clinical data sets. 74 clinical accuracy data sets were evaluated that included 31,202 samples. Across all meta-analyzed samples, the pooled Ag-RDT sensitivity was 73.8% (CI 68.6 to 78.5). If analysis was restricted to studies that followed the Ag-RDT manufacturers instructions using fresh upper respiratory swab samples, the sensitivity increased to 79.1% (95%CI 75.0 to 82.8). The SD Biosensor Standard Q and Abbott Panbio showed the highest sensitivity with 81.7% and 72.7%, respectively. The best Ag-RDT performance was found with nasopharyngeal sampling (77.3%, CI 72.0 to 81.9) in comparison to other sample types (e.g., anterior nasal or mid turbinate 63.5%, CI 49.5 to 75.5). Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in higher sensitivity (87.5%, CI 86.0 to 89.1) compared to testing after one week (64.1%, CI 54.4 to 73.8). The tests performed markedly better on samples with lower Ct-values, i.e., <30 (87.9%, CI 86.7 to 88.8), in comparison to those with Ct [&ge;] 30 (47.8%, CI 41.1 to 54.5). Bias concerns were raised across all data sets, and financial support from the manufacturer was re-ported in 28.2% of data sets.

ConclusionAs Ag-RDTs detect most cases within the first week of symptom onset and those with high viral load, they can have high utility for screening purposes in the early phase of disease, and thus can be a valuable tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Standardization of conduct and reporting of clinical accuracy studies would improve comparability and use of data.

SummaryIn this living systematic review we analyzed 98 data sets for performance of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs compared to RT-PCR. Best-performing tests achieved a sensitivity of 81.7%. Highest sensitivity was found in patients within seven days of symptom onset when NP swabs were utilized.",Lukas E Bruemmer; Stephan Katzenschlager; Mary Gaeddert; Christian Erdmann; Stephani Schmitz; Marc Bota; Maurizio Grilli; Jan Larmann; Markus A Weigand; Nira Pollock; Sergio Carmona; Stefano Ongarello; Jilian Sacks; Claudia M Denkinger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252546,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252546,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
491,FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES AND SARS-COV-2-MULTI-POPULATION MODELING WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF DISPARITY BY RACE/ETHNICITY USING ENSEMBLE DATA ASSIMILATION,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic has imposed many strenuous effects on the global economy, community, and medical infrastructure. Since the out- break, researchers and policymakers have scrambled to develop ways to identify how COVID-19 will affect specific sub-populations so that good public health decisions can be made. To this end, we adapt the work of Evensen et al [1] which introduces a SEIR model that incorporates an age-stratified contact matrix, a time dependent effective reproduction number R, and uses ensemble data assimilation to estimate model parameters. The adaptation is an extension of Evensens modeling framework, in which we model sub-populations with varying risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in a particular state, each with a characteristic age-stratified contact matrix. In this work, we will focus on 9 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia. We estimate the effective reproductive number as a function of time for our different sub-populations and then divide them into two groups: frontline communities (FLCs) and the complement (NFLCs). Our model will account for mixing both within populations (intra-population mixing) and between populations (inter-population mixing). Our data is conditioned on the daily numbers of accumulated deaths for each sub-population. We aim to test and demonstrate methodologies that can be used to assess critical metrics of the pandemics evolution which are difficult to directly measure. The output may ultimately be of use to measure the success or failures of the pandemic response and provide experts and policymakers a tool to create better plans for a future outbreak or pandemic. We consider the results of this work to be a reanalysis of pandemic evolution across differently affected sub-populations which may also be used to improve modeling and forecasts.",Emmanuel Fleurantin; Christian Sampson; Daniel Mase; Justin Bennett; Tayler Fernandes Nunez; Sophia Marx; Geir Evensen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252589,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252589,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
492,Estimating the burden of post-COVID-19 syndrome in a population-based cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals: Implications for healthcare service planning,"ObjectiveTo assess the prevalence of impaired health status and physical and mental health symptoms among individuals at least six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to characterise their healthcare utilisation.

DesignPopulation-based prospective cohort study.

SettingZurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort, Zurich, Switzerland.

Participants431 adults from the general population with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to health authorities between 27 February 2020 and 05 August 2020.

Main outcome measuresWe assessed the proportion of individuals reporting not having fully recovered since SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportion reporting fatigue (assessed by Fatigue Assessment Scale), dyspnoea (assessed by mMRC dyspnoea scale) or depression (assessed by DASS-21) at six to eight months after diagnosis. We further evaluated the proportion of individuals with at least one healthcare contact since their acute illness. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the main outcomes.

ResultsSymptoms were present in 385 (89%) participants at diagnosis and 81 (19%) were initially hospitalised. At six to eight months, 111 (26%) reported not having fully recovered. 233 (55%) participants reported symptoms of fatigue, 96 (25%) had at least grade 1 dyspnoea, and 111 (26%) had DASS-21 scores indicating symptoms of depression. 170 (40%) participants reported at least one general practitioner visit related to COVID-19 after acute illness, and 10% (8/81) of initially hospitalised individuals were rehospitalised. Individuals that have not fully recovered or suffer from fatigue, dyspnoea or depression were more likely to have further healthcare contacts. However, a third of individuals (37/111) that have not fully recovered did not seek further care.

ConclusionIn our population-based study, a relevant proportion of individuals suffered from longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of individuals affected by post-COVID-19 syndrome is to be expected, and that a wide range of additional healthcare services and integrative approaches will be required to support the recovery of these individuals. Thus, the timely planning of resources and services for post-COVID-19 care will be necessary alongside public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.

MethodsWe developed an agent-based model of infection dynamics and preventive mitigation strategies such as distancing, health behaviors, surveillance and symptomatic testing, daily symptom and exposure screening, quarantine policies, and vaccination. The model parameters can be updated as the science evolves and are adjustable via an online user interface, enabling users to explore the effects of interventions on outcomes of interest to states and localities, under a variety of plausible epidemiological and policy assumptions.

ResultsUnder default assumptions, secondary infection rates and school attendance are substantially affected by surveillance testing protocols, vaccination rates, class sizes, and effectiveness of safety education.

ConclusionsOur model helps policymakers consider how mitigation options and the dynamics of school infection risks affect outcomes of interest. The models parameters can be immediately updated in response to changes in epidemiological conditions, science of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, testing and vaccination resources, and reliability of mitigation strategies.",Douglas Ezra Morrison; Roch Nianogo; Vladimir Manuel; Onyebuchi A Arah; Nathaniel Anderson; Tony Kuo; Moira Inkelas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252535,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252535,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
494,Evaluating the trade-off between transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 by mathematical modeling,"BackgroundAt the beginning of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 spread to all continents, and since then, mutations have appeared in different regions of the world. The appearance of more virulent mutations leads to asseverate that they are also more transmissible. We analyzed the lower and higher virulent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics to establish a relationship between transmissibility and virulence based on a mathematical model.

MethodsA compartmental mathematical model based on the CoViD-19 natural history encompassing the age-dependent fatality was applied to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and virulence. The transmissibility was measured by the basic reproduction number R0 and the virulence by the proportion of asymptomatic individuals. The model parameters were fitted considering the observed data from Sao Paulo State.

ResultsThe numbers of severe CoViD-19 and deaths are three times higher, but R0 is 25% lower in more virulent SARS-CoV-2 transmission than in a less virulent one. However, the number of more virulent SARS-CoV-2 transmitting individuals is 25% lower, mainly due to symptomatic individuals isolation, explaining the increased transmission in lower virulence.

ConclusionsThe quarantine study in Sao Paulo State showed that the more virulent SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a higher number of fatalities but less transmissible than the less virulent one. One possible explanation for the number of deaths surpassing that predicted by the low virulent SARS-CoV-2 infection could be the transmission of more virulent variant(s).",Hyun Mo Yang; Luis Pedro Pedro Lombardi Junior; Ariana Campos Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252592,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252592,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
495,A rigorous evaluation of optimal peptide targets for MS-based clinical diagnostics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has had a profound, lasting impact on the worlds population. A key aspect to providing care for those with COVID-19 and checking its further spread is early and accurate diagnosis of infection, which has been generally done via methods for amplifying and detecting viral RNA molecules. Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc. In this study we have compiled a list of 639 peptides identified from Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) samples, including from in vitro and clinical sources. These datasets were rigorously analyzed using automated, Galaxy-based workflows containing tools such as PepQuery, BLAST-P, and the Multi-omic Visualization Platform as well as the open-source tools MetaTryp and Proteomics Data Viewer (PDV). Using PepQuery for confirming peptide spectrum matches, we were able to narrow down the 639 peptide possibilities to 87 peptides which were most robustly detected and specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The specificity of these sequences to coronavirus taxa was confirmed using Unipept and BLAST-P. Applying stringent statistical scoring thresholds, combined with manual verification of peptide spectrum match quality, 4 peptides derived from the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and membrane protein were found to be most robustly detected across all cell culture and clinical samples, including those collected non-invasively. We propose that these peptides would be of the most value for clinical proteomics applications seeking to detect COVID-19 from a variety of sample types. We also contend that samples taken from the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity have the highest potential for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from easily collected patient samples using mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays.",Andrew T Rajczewski; Subina Mehta; Dinh Duy An Ngyuen; Björn Andreas Grüning; James E Johnson; Thomas F McGowan; Timothy Griffin; Pratik Jagtap,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251427,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251427,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
496,Mice immunized with the vaccine candidate HexaPro spike produce neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"Updated and revised versions of COVID-19 vaccines are vital due to genetic variations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. Furthermore, vaccines that are safe, cost-effective, and logistically friendly are critically needed for global equity, especially for middle to low income countries. Recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been reported with the use of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the prefusion spike trimers (S-2P). Recently, a new version of prefusion spike trimers, so called ""HexaPro"", has been shown for its physical property to possess two RBD in the ""up"" conformation, as opposed to just one exposed RBD found in S-2P. Importantly, this HexaPro spike antigen is more stable than S-2P, raising its feasibility for global logistics and supply chain. Here, we report that the spike protein HexaPro offers a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Mice immunized by the recombinant HexaPro adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide using a prime-boost regimen produced high-titer neutralizing antibodies for up to 56 days after initial immunization against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the level of neutralization activity is comparable to that of convalescence sera.

497,Ultrapotent miniproteins targeting the receptor-binding domain protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in mice,"Despite the introduction of public health measures and spike protein-based vaccines to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths continue to rise. Previously, we used a structural design approach to develop picomolar range miniproteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. Here, we investigated the capacity of modified versions of one lead binder, LCB1, to protect against SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung disease in human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice. Systemic administration of LCB1-Fc reduced viral burden, diminished immune cell infiltration and inflammation, and completely prevented lung disease and pathology. A single intranasal dose of LCB1v1.3 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung even when given as many as five days before or two days after virus inoculation. Importantly, LCB1v1.3 protected in vivo against a historical strain (WA1/2020), an emerging B.1.1.7 strain, and a strain encoding key E484K and N501Y spike protein substitutions. These data support development of LCB1v1.3 for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433110,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433110,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,False
498,Effect of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on vascular permeability,"SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to severe disease associated with cytokine storm, vascular dysfunction, coagulation, and progressive lung damage. It affects several vital organs, seemingly through a pathological effect on endothelial cells. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 29 proteins, whose contribution to the disease manifestations, and especially endothelial complications, is unknown. We cloned and expressed 26 of these proteins in human cells and characterized the endothelial response to overexpression of each, individually. Whereas most proteins induced significant changes in endothelial permeability, nsp2, nsp5_c145a (catalytic dead mutant of nsp5) and nsp7 also reduced CD31, and increased von Willebrand factor expression and IL-6, suggesting endothelial dysfunction. Using propagation-based analysis of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we predicted the endothelial proteins affected by the viral proteins that potentially mediate these effects. We further applied our PPI model to identify the role of each SARS-CoV-2 protein in other tissues affected by COVID-19. Overall, this work identifies the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that might be most detrimental in terms of endothelial dysfunction, thereby shedding light on vascular aspects of COVID-19.",Rossana Rauti; Meishar Shahoha; Yael Leichtmann-Bardoogo; Rami Nasser; Rina Tamir; Victoria Miller; Tal Babich; Kfir Shaked; Avner Ehrlich; Konstantinos Ioannidis; Yaakov Nahmias; Roded Sharan; Uri Ashery; Ben Meir Maoz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.433186,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.433186,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,False
499,"Physical Activity Patterns Among Patients with Intracardiac Remote Monitoring Devices Before, During, and After COVID-19-related Public Health Restrictions","Nationwide public health restrictions due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have disrupted peoples routine physical activities, yet little objective information is available on the extent to which physical activity has changed among patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases. Using remote monitoring data of 9,924 patients with pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) living in New York City and Minneapolis/Saint Paul, we assessed physical activity patterns among these patients in 2019 and 2020 from January through October. We found marked declines in physical activity among patients with implantable cardiac devices during COVID-19-related restrictions and the reduction was consistent across age and sex subgroups. Moreover, physical activity among these vulnerable patients did not return to pre-restrictions levels several months after COVID-19 restrictions were eased. Our findings highlight the need to consider the unintended consequences of mitigation strategies and develop approaches to encourage safe physical activity during the pandemic.",Yuan Lu; Karthik Murugiah; Paul Jones; Daisy Massey; Shiwani Mahajan; Cesar Caraballo; Ahmed Rezwan; Eric Bader; Harlan Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252558,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252558,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True

Using remote monitoring data of 4,029 patients with implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) living in New York City and Minneapolis/Saint Paul, we assessed changes in markers of cardiac status among these patients and compared thoracic impedance and arrhythmia burden in 2019 and 2020 from January through August. We found no change in several key disease decompensation markers among patients with implanted ICD devices during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that the decrease in cardiovascular hospitalizations in this period is not reflective of a true population-level improvement in cardiovascular health.",Yuan Lu; Karthik Murugiah; Paul Jones; Cesar Caraballo; Shiwani Mahajan; Daisy Massey; Ahmed Rezwan; Eric Bader; Harlan Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252559,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252559,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
501,"Risk factors for illness severity among pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection - Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network, 20 state, local, and territorial health departments, March 29, 2020 -January 8, 2021","BackgroundPregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk for severe illness compared with nonpregnant women. Data to assess risk factors for illness severity among pregnant women with COVID-19 are limited. This study aimed to determine risk factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsPregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by molecular testing were reported during March 29, 2020-January 8, 2021 through the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). Criteria for illness severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate-to-severe, or critical) were adapted from National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization criteria. Crude and adjusted risk ratios for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness were calculated for selected demographic and clinical characteristics.

ResultsAmong 5,963 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness was associated with age 30-39 years, Black/Non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, healthcare occupation, pre-pregnancy obesity, chronic lung disease, chronic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and pregestational diabetes mellitus. Risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness increased with the number of underlying medical or pregnancy-related conditions.

ConclusionsPregnant women with moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness were more likely to be older and have underlying medical conditions compared to pregnant women with asymptomatic infection or mild COVID-19 illness. This information might help pregnant women understand their risk for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness and inform targeted public health messaging.

SummaryAmong pregnant women with COVID-19, older age and underlying medical conditions were risk factors for increased illness severity. These findings can be used to inform pregnant women about their risk for severe COVID-19 illness and public health messaging.",Romeo R Galang; Suzanne M Newton; Kate R Woodworth; Isabel Griffin; Titilope Oduyebo; Christina L Sancken; Emily O'Malley Olsen; Kathy Aveni; Heather Wingate; Hanna Shephard; Chris Fussman; Zahra S Alaali; Samantha Siebman; Umme-Aiman Halai; Camille Delgado Lopez; Jerusha Barton; Mamie Lush; Paul H Patrick; Levi Schlosser; Ayomide Sokale; Ifrah Chaudhary; Bethany Reynolds; Similoluwa Sowunmi; Nicole Gaarenstroom; Jennifer S Read; Sarah Chicchelly; Leah de Wilde; Eduardo Azziz-Baumgartner; Aron J Hall; Van T Tong; Sascha Ellington; Suzanne M Gilboa; - CDC COVID-19 Response Pregnancy and Infant Linked Outcomes Team,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252169,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252169,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,True
502,In vitro screening of herbal medicinal products for their supportive curing potential in the context of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundHerbal medicinal products have a long-standing history of use in the therapy of common respiratory infections. In the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have the potential for symptom relief in non-severe or moderate disease cases. Here we describe the results derived by in vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i) interfere with the binding of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, ii) modulate the release of the human defensin HBD1 and cathelicidin LL-37 from human A549 lung cells upon Spike S1 protein stimulation and iii) modulate the release of IFN-{gamma} from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The investigated extracts were: Sinupret extract (SINx), Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TE), Bronchipret thyme-primrose (BRO TP), Imupret (IMU), and Tonsipret (TOP).

MethodsThe inhibitory effect of the herbal medicinal products on the binding interaction of Spike S1 protein and the human ACE2 receptor was measured by ELISA. The effects on intracellular IFN-{gamma} expression in stimulated human PBMCs were measured by flow cytometry. Regulation on HBD1 and LL-37 expression and secretion was assessed in 25d long-term cultured human lung A549 epithelial cells by RT-PCR and ELISA.

ResultsIMU and BRO TE concentration-dependently inhibited the interaction between spike protein and the ACE2 Receptor. However, this effect was only observed in the cell-free assay at a concentration range which was later on determined as cytotoxic to human PBMC. SINx, TOP and BRO TP significantly upregulated the intracellular expression of antiviral IFN{gamma} from stimulated PBMC. Co-treatment of A549 cells with IMU or BRO TP together with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significantly upregulated mRNA expression (IMU) and release (IMU and BRO TP) of HBD1 and LL-37 (BRO TP).

ConclusionsThe in vitro screening results provide first evidence for an immune activating potential of some of the tested herbal medicinal extracts in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Whether these could be helpful in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 invasion or supportive in recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection needs deeper understanding of the observations.",Hoai Tran; Philipp Peterburs; Jan Seibel; Dimitri Abramov-Sommariva; Evelyn Lamy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433344,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433344,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,False
503,Reduced antibody cross-reactivity following infection with B.1.1.7 than with parental SARS-CoV-2 strains,"We examined the immunogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant B.1.1.7 that arose in the United Kingdom and spread globally. Antibodies elicited by B.1.1.7 infection exhibited significantly reduced recognition and neutralisation of parental strains or of the South Africa B.1.351 variant, than of the infecting variant. The drop in cross-reactivity was more pronounced following B.1.1.7 than parental strain infection, indicating asymmetric heterotypic immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Nikhil Faulkner; Kevin Ng; Mary Wu; Ruth Harvey; Saira Hussain; Maria Greco; William Bolland; Scott Warchal; Marios Margaritis; Stavroula Paraskevopoulou; Judith Heaney; Hannah Rickman; Catherine Houlihan; Moria Spyer; Daniel Frampton; Matthew Byott; Tulio de Oliveira; Alex Sigal; Svend Kjaer; Charles Swanton; Sonia Gandhi; Rupert Beale; Steve Gamblin; John Mccauley; Rodney Daniels; Michael Howell; David Bauer; Eleni Nastouli; George Kassiotis,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433314,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433314,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,False
504,Negligible impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactivity in COVID-19 exposed donors and vaccinees.,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants highlighted the need to better understand adaptive immune responses to this virus. It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Alison Tarke; John Sidney; Nils Methot; Yun Zhang; Jennifer M Dan; Benjamin Goodwin; Paul Rubiro; Aaron Sutherland; Ricardo da Silva Antunes; April Fraizer; Stephen A.

505,Systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection of an ACE2-negative human airway cell,"Established in vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited and include cell lines of non-human origin and those engineered to overexpress ACE2, the cognate host cell receptor. We identified human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of ACE2. Infection of H522 cells required the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, though in contrast to ACE2-dependent models, spike alone was not sufficient for H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type-I interferon signaling. Focused chemical screens point to important roles for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosomal cathepsins in SARS-CoV-2 infection of H522 cells. These findings imply the utilization of an alternative SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor which may impact tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently human disease pathogenesis.",Maritza Puray-Chavez; Kyle M Lapak; Travis P.

506,The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase RNF5 Facilitates SARS-CoV-2 Membrane Protein-Mediated Virion Release,"As enveloped virus, SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein (M) mediates viral release from cellular membranes, but the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virions release remain poorly understood. Here, we performed RNAi screening and identified the E3 ligase RNF5 which mediates ubiquitination of SARS-CoV-2 M at residue K15 to enhance the interaction of viral envelope (E) with M. M-E complex ensures the uniform size of viral particles for viral maturation and mediates viral release. Moreover, overexpression of M induces complete autophagy which is dependent on RNF5-mediated ubiquitin modification. M inhibits the activity of lysosome protease, and uses autolysosomes for virion release. Consequently, all these results demonstrate that RNF5 mediates ubiquitin modification of SARS-CoV-2 M to stabilize the M-E complex and induce autophagy for virion release.",Zhen Yuan; Binbin Ding,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.433287,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.433287,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,False

In the present study we provide a comprehensive comparison between the quality of the assemblies obtained from different sequencing protocols.

508,Day-night and seasonal variation of human gene expression across tissues,"Circadian and circannual cycles trigger physiological changes whose reflection on human transcriptomes remains largely uncharted. We used the time and season of death of 932 individuals from GTEx to jointly investigate transcriptomic changes associated with those cycles across multiple tissues. For most tissues, we found little overlap between genes changing expression during day-night and among seasons. Although all tissues remodeled their transcriptomes, brain and gonadal tissues exhibited the highest seasonality, whereas those in the thoracic cavity showed stronger day-night regulation. Core clock genes displayed marked day-night differences across multiple tissues, which were largely conserved in baboon and mouse, but adapted to their nocturnal or diurnal habits. Seasonal variation of expression affected multiple pathways and were enriched among genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, they unveiled cytoarchitectural changes in brain subregions. Altogether, our results provide the first combined atlas of how transcriptomes from human tissues adapt to major cycling environmental conditions.",Valentin Wucher; Reza Sodaei; Raziel Amador; Manuel Irimia; Roderic Guigo,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.433266,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.433266,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,False
509,Structural O-Glycoform Heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor-Binding Domain Revealed by Native Top-Down Mass Spectrometry,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes an extensively glycosylated surface spike (S) protein to mediate host cell entry and the S protein glycosylation is strongly implicated in altering viral binding/function and infectivity. However, the structures and relative abundance of the new O-glycans found on the S protein regional-binding domain (S-RBD) remain cryptic because of the challenges in intact glycoform analysis. Here, we report the complete structural characterization of intact O-glycan proteoforms using native top-down mass spectrometry (MS). By combining trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), which can separate the protein conformers of S-RBD and analyze their gas phase structural variants, with ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS analysis, the O-glycoforms of the S-RBD are comprehensively characterized, so that seven O-glycoforms and their relative molecular abundance are structurally elucidated for the first time. These findings demonstrate that native top-down MS can provide a high-resolution proteoform-resolved mapping of diverse O-glycoforms of the S glycoprotein, which lays a strong molecular foundation to uncover the functional roles of their O-glycans. This proteoform-resolved approach can be applied to reveal the structural O-glycoform heterogeneity of emergent SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD variants, as well as other O-glycoproteins in general.",David S Roberts; Morgan W Mann; Jake A Melby; Eli J Larson; Yanlong Zhu; Allan R Brasier; Song Jin; Ying Ge,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.433291,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.433291,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,,False
