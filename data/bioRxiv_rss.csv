0,Evaluation of a fully automated high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex qPCR assay with build-in screening functionality for DelHV69/70- and N501Y variants such as B.1.1.7,"Background: New SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility, like B.1.1.7 from England or B1.351 from South Africa, have caused considerable concern worldwide. In order to contain the spread of these lineages, it is of utmost importance to have rapid, sensitive and high-throughput detection methods at hand. Methods: Analytical sensitivity was assessed for both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 lineage by serial dilution. A total of 141 clinical samples were subjected to the test and results compared to a commercial manual typing-PCR assay and NGS. Results: The multiplex assay is highly sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, with an LoD of 25.82 cp/ml (CI: 11.61 - 57.48). LoDs are slightly higher for the HV68/70 deletion (111.36 cp/ml; CI: 78.16 - 158.67) and the N501Y SNP (2548.04 cp/ml, CI: 1592.58 - 4076.73). A total of 141 clinical samples were tested with the assay, including 16 samples containing SARS-CoV-2 of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Three non-B.1.1.7 samples contained a HV69/70 deletion. All were correctly identified by the multiplex assay. Conclusion: We describe here a highly sensitive, fully automated multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of del-HV69/70 and N501Y that can distinguish between lineages B.1.1.7 and B1.351. The assay allows for high-throughput screening for relevant variants in clinical samples prior to sequencing.",Dominik Nörz; Moritz Grunwald; Flaminia Olearo; Nicole Fischer; Martin Aepfelbacher; Susanne Pfefferle; Marc Lütgehetmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251614,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251614,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
1,"Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genetic structure and infection clusters in a large German city based on integrated genomic surveillance, outbreak analysis, and contact tracing","Viral genome sequencing can address key questions about SARS-CoV-2 evolution and viral transmission. Here, we present an integrated system of genomic surveillance in the German city of Dusseldorf, combining a) viral surveillance sequencing, b) genetically based identification of infection clusters in the population, c) analysis of hospital outbreaks, d) integration of public health authority contact tracing data, and e) a user-friendly dashboard application as a central data analysis platform. The generated surveillance sequencing data (n = 320 SARS-CoV-2 genomes) showed that the development of the local viral population structure from August to December 2020 was consistent with European trends, with the notable absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants 20I/501Y.V1/B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 until the end of the local sampling period. Against a background of local surveillance and other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 data, four putative SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at Dusseldorf University Hospital between October and December 2020 (n = 44 viral genomes) were investigated and confirmed as clonal, contributing to the development of improved infection control and prevention measures. An analysis of the generated surveillance sequencing data with respect to infection clusters in the population based on a greedy clustering algorithm identified five candidate clusters, all of which were subsequently confirmed by the integration of public health authority contact tracing data and shown to be represent transmission settings of particular relevance (schools, care homes). A joint analysis of outbreak and surveillance data identified a potential transmission of an outbreak strain from the local population into the hospital and back; and an in-depth analysis of one population infection cluster combining genetic with contact tracing data enabled the identification of a previously unrecognized population transmission chain involving a martial arts gym. Based on these results and a real-time sequencing experiment in which we demonstrated the feasibility of achieving sample-to-turnaround times of <30 hours with the Oxford Nanopore technology, we discuss the potential benefits of routine ultra-fast sequencing of all detected infections for contact tracing, infection cluster detection, and, ultimately, improved management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Andreas Walker; Torsten Houwaart; Patrick Finzer; Lutz Ehlkes; Alona Tyshaieva; Maximilian Damagnez; Daniel Strelow; Ashley Duplessis; Jessica Nicolai; Tobias Wienemann; Teresa Tamayo; Malte Kohns Vasconcelos; Lisanna Hülse; Katrin Hoffmann; Nadine Lübke; Sandra Hauka; Marcel Andree; Martin P Däumer; Alexander Thielen; Susanne Kolbe-Busch; Klaus Göbels; Rainer Zotz; Klaus Pfeffer; Jörg Timm; Alexander T Dilthey; - German COVID-19 OMICS Initiative (DeCOI),https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251678,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251678,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
2,Optimal Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccines in the Philippines,"Vaccine allocation is a national concern especially for countries such as the Philippines that have limited resources in acquiring COVID-19 vaccines. As such, certain groups are suggested to be prioritized for vaccination to protect the most vulnerable before vaccinating others. Our model suggests an allocation of vaccines such that COVID-19 deaths are minimized while the prioritization framework is satisfied. Results of the model show that a vaccine coverage of at least 50 to 70% of the population can be enough for a community with limited supplies, and an increase in vaccine supply is beneficial if initial coverage is less than the specified target range. Also, among the vaccines considered in the study, the one with 89.9% effectiveness and has a 183 Philippine peso (Php) price per dose projected the least number of deaths. Compared to other model variations and common allocation approaches, the model has achieved both an optimal and equitable allocation. This will be helpful for policymakers in determining a vaccine distribution for a resource-constrained community.",Christian Alvin H Buhat; Destiny SM Lutero; Yancee H Olave; Kemuel M Quindala; Mary Grace P Recreo; Dylan Antonio SJ Talabis Jr.; Monica C Torres; Jerrold M Tubay; Jomar F Rabajante,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251640,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251640,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
3,"A disproportionate epidemic: COVID-19 cases and deaths among essential workers in Toronto, Canada","Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of non-essential businesses have been central to COVID-19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases (N=74,477) and deaths (N=2319), and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths. Taken together, results signal the need for active intervention strategies to complement restrictive measures to optimize both the equity and effectiveness of COVID-19 responses.",Amrita Rao; Huiting Ma; Gary Moloney; Jeff Kwong; Peter Juni; Beate Sander; Rafal Kustra; Stefan D Baral; Sharmistha Mishra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251572,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
4,COVID-19 Associated Stroke--A Single Centre Experience,"Background and Purpose: Various neurological complications have been reported in association with COVID-19. We report our experience of COVID-19 with stroke at a single center over a period of eight months spanning 1 March to 31 October 2020. Methods: We recruited all patients admitted to Internal Medicine with an acute stroke, who also tested positive for COVID-19 on RTPCR. We included all stroke cases in our analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality, and separately analyzed arterial infarcts for vascular territory of ischemic strokes. Results: There were 62 stroke cases among 3923 COVID-19 admissions (incidence 1.6%). Data was available for 58 patients {mean age 52.6 years; age range 17 - 91; F/M=20/38; 24% (14/58) aged [&le;] 40; 51% (30/58) hypertensive; 36% (21/58) diabetic; 41% (24/58) with O2 saturation <95% at admission; 32/58 (55.17 %) in-hospital mortality}. Among 58 strokes, there were 44 arterial infarcts, seven bleeds, three arterial infarcts with associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two combined infarct and bleed, and two of indeterminate type. Among the total 49 infarcts, Carotid territory was the commonest affected (36/49; 73.5%), followed by vertebrobasilar (7/49; 14.3%) and both (6/49; 12.2%). Concordant arterial block was seen in 61% (19 of 31 infarcts with angiography done). 'Early stroke' (within 48 hours of respiratory symptoms) was seen in 82.7% (48/58) patients. Patients with poor saturation at admission were older (58 vs 49 years) and had more comorbidities and higher mortality (79% vs 38%). Mortality was similar in young strokes and older patients, although the latter required more intense respiratory support. Logistic regression analysis showed that low GCS and requirement for increasing intensity of respiratory support predicted in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: We had a 1.6% incidence of COVID-19 related stroke of which the majority were carotid territory infarcts. In-hospital mortality was 55.17%, predicted by low GCS at admission.",Uma Sundar; Niteen Karnik; Amita Mukhopadhyay; Pramod Darole; Shaonak Kolte; Ashank Bansal; Yojana Gokhale; Dnaneshwar Asole; Anagha Joshi; Sangeeta Pednekar; Swati Chavan; Trupti Trivedi; Namita Padwal; Lalana Kalekar; Charulata Londhe; Rupal Padhiyar; Dharmendra Pandey; Dhirendra Yadav; Sonal Honrao; Prerana Bhavsar; Priyanshu Shah; Satish Gosavi; Aniket Wadal; Awesh Shingare; Mayuri Trivedi; Gauri Pathak Oak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21249420,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21249420,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
5,Excess Mortality in Suicide caused by COVID-19 in Japan,"Background: Countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdown and voluntary restrictions against going out adversely affect human stress and economic activity. Particularly, this stress might lead to suicide. Object: We examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19. Method: We applied the NIID model to suicide deaths from October 2009 through September, 2020 for the whole of Japan for both genders. Effects of the great earthquake that struck in eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 were incorporated into the estimation model. Results: Significant excess mortality in suicide was found in July, August and September in 2020 for both genders. It was greater among females than among males. In total, 810 excess cases of mortality were identified. Discussion and Conclusion: Excess mortality during the two months was 1.4 times greater than the number of COVID-19 deaths confirmed by PCR testing. Countermeasures against COVID-19 should be chosen carefully in light of suicide effects.",Junko Kurita; Yoshiyuki Sugishita; Tamie Sugawara; Yasushi Ohkusa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251670,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251670,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
6,Development and validation of a dynamic 48-hour in-hospital prognostic risk stratification for COVID-19 in a UK teaching hospital: a retrospective cohort study,"We propose a prognostic dynamic risk stratification for 48-hour in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, using demographics and routinely-collected observations and laboratory tests: age, Clinical Frailty Scale score, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, white cell count, acidosis (pH < 7.35) and Interleukin-6. We train and validate the model using data from a UK teaching hospital, adopting a landmarking approach that accounts for competing risks and informative missingness. Internal validation of the model on the first wave of patients presenting between March 1 and September 12, 2020 achieves an AUROC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93). Temporal validation on patients presenting between September 13, 2020 and January 1, 2021 gives an AUROC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.95). The resulting mortality stratification tool has the potential to provide physicians with an assessment of a patient's evolving prognosis throughout the course of active hospital treatment.",Martin Wiegand; Sarah L Cowan; Claire S Waddington; David J Halsall; Victoria L Keevil; Brian D M Tom; Vince Taylor; Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas; Jacobus Preller; Robert JB Goudie,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251150,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251150,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
7,"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey Among District Residents Presenting for Serologic Testing at Three Community Based Test Sites in Washington, DC, July to August, 2020","Background The District of Columbia (DC), a major metropolitan area, continues to see community transmission of SARS CoV 2. While serologic testing does not indicate current SARS CoV 2 infection, it can indicate prior infection and help inform local policy and health guidance. The DC Department of Health (DC Health) conducted a community based survey to estimate DC SARS CoV 2 seroprevalence and identify seropositivity associated factors. Methods A mixed-methods cross-sectional serology survey was conducted among a convenience sample of DC residents during July 27 through August 21, 2020. Free serology testing was offered at three public test sites. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire on household and demographic characteristics, COVID like illness (CLI) since January 1, 2020, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 exposures. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to describe the sample population and assess factors associated with seropositivity. Results Among a sample of 671 participants, 51 individuals were seropositive, yielding an estimated seroprevalence of 7.6%. More than half (56.9%) of the seropositive participants reported no prior CLI; nearly half (47.1%) had no prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. Race/ethnicity, prior SARS-CoV-2 testing, prior CLI, employment status, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were associated with seropositivity (P<0.05). Among those reporting prior CLI, loss of taste or smell, duration of CLI, fewer days between CLI and serology test, or prior viral test were associated with seropositivity (P[&le;]0.006). Conclusions These findings indicate many seropositive individuals reported no symptoms consistent with CLI since January or any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. This underscores the potential for cases to go undetected in the community and suggests wider-spread transmission than previously reported in DC.",Adrienne Sherman; Jacqueline Reuben; Naomi S David; Delores P Quasie-Woods; Jayleen K.

8,Mapping of SARS-CoV-2 Brain Invasion and Histopathology in COVID-19 Disease,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) causes acute respiratory distress, termed COVID-19 disease, with substantial morbidity and mortality. As SCV2 is related to previously-studied coronaviruses that have been shown to have the capability for brain invasion, it seems likely that SCV2 may be able to do so as well. To date, although there have been many clinical and autopsy-based reports that describe a broad range of SCV2-associated neurological conditions, it is unclear what fraction of these have been due to direct CNS invasion versus indirect effects caused by systemic reactions to critical illness. Still critically lacking is a comprehensive tissue-based survey of the CNS presence and specific neuropathology of SCV2 in humans. We conducted an extensive neuroanatomical survey of RT-PCR-detected SCV2 in 16 brain regions from 20 subjects who died of COVID-19 disease. Targeted areas were those with cranial nerve nuclei, including the olfactory bulb, medullary dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the pontine trigeminal nerve nuclei, as well as areas possibly exposed to hematogenous entry, including the choroid plexus, leptomeninges, median eminence of the hypothalamus and area postrema of the medulla. Subjects ranged in age from 38 to 97 (mean 77) with 9 females and 11 males. Most subjects had typical age-related neuropathological findings. Two subjects had severe neuropathology, one with a large acute cerebral infarction and one with hemorrhagic encephalitis, that was unequivocally related to their COVID-19 disease while most of the 18 other subjects had non-specific histopathology including focal B-amyloid precursor protein white matter immunoreactivity and sparse perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing. Four subjects (20%) had SCV2 RNA in one or more brain regions including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, entorhinal area, temporal and frontal neocortex, dorsal medulla and leptomeninges. The subject with encephalitis was SCV2-positive in a histopathologically-affected area, the entorhinal cortex, while the subject with the large acute cerebral infarct was SCV2-negative in all brain regions. Like other human coronaviruses, SCV2 can inflict acute neuropathology in susceptible patients. Much remains to be understood, including what viral and host factors influence SCV2 brain invasion and whether it is cleared from the brain subsequent to the acute illness.",Geidy E Serrano; Jessica E.

9,FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective per real-world evidence synthesized across a multi-state health system,"Large Phase 3 clinical trials of the two FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), have demonstrated efficacies of 94.1% (n = 30,420, 95% CI: 89.3-96.8) and 95% (n = 43,448, 95% CI: 90.3-97.6) in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, respectively. Given the ongoing vaccine rollout to healthcare personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, here we provide a preliminary assessment of real-world vaccination efficacy in 62,138 individuals from the Mayo Clinic and associated health system (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin) between December 1st 2020 and February 8th 2021. Our retrospective analysis contrasts 31,069 individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who are propensity-matched based on demographics, location (zip code), and number of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and were at risk for infection at least 36 days after their first dose. Administration of two COVID-19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. Furthermore, vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than propensity-matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk: 0.4; p-value: 0.007).

10,Circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity,"Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS- CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild- type pseudovirus, 5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.",Wilfredo F.

11,Artificial Intelligence Applications for COVID-19 in Intensive Care and Emergency Settings: A Systematic Review,"Background: Little is known about the role of artificial intelligence (AI) as a decisive technology in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current evidence on AI applications for COVID-19 in intensive care and emergency settings, focusing on methods, reporting standards, and clinical utility. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases from inception to 1 October 2020, without language restrictions. We included peer-reviewed original studies that applied AI for COVID-19 patients, healthcare workers, or health systems in intensive care, emergency or prehospital settings. We assessed predictive modelling studies using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) and a modified TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) statement for AI. We critically appraised the methodology and key findings of all other studies. Results: Of fourteen eligible studies, eleven developed prognostic or diagnostic AI predictive models, all of which were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Common pitfalls included inadequate sample sizes, poor handling of missing data, failure to account for censored participants, and weak validation of models. Studies had low adherence to reporting guidelines, with particularly poor reporting on model calibration and blinding of outcome and predictor assessment. Of the remaining three studies, two evaluated the prognostic utility of deep learning-based lung segmentation software and one studied an AI-based system for resource optimisation in the ICU. These studies had similar issues in methodology, validation, and reporting.

12,Quantification of the tradeoff between test sensitivity and test frequency in COVID-19 epidemic - a multi-scale modeling approach,"Control strategies that employ real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic are inefficient in fighting the epidemic due to high cost, delays in obtaining results, and the need of specialized personnel and equipment for laboratory processing. Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 57% to as low as 1.5% half a year into the outbreak and to 3.2% three years into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.",Jonathan E Forde; Stanca M.

13,Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a distinct nasal cytokine profile,"Understanding the host viral interaction at the nasal mucosa, the primary site of SARSCoV2 infection, may provide important insights into COVID19 pathogenesis. Here, we studied nasal and systemic immune parameters in comprehensively characterised patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID19, and healthy community controls. PCR confirmed COVID19 participants were more likely to receive dexamethasone and a betalactam antibiotic, and more likely to survive to hospital discharge than PCR negative/IgG+ and PCR negative/IgG- participants. PCR negative/IgG+ participants exhibited a nasal and systemic cytokine signature analogous to PCR confirmed COVID19 participants, but had an increased propensity for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation. The nasal immune signature in PCR negative/IgG+ and PCR confirmed COVID19 participants was distinct and predominated by chemokines and neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that severe COVID19 is associated with inflammatory chemokine and neutrophil predominance in the nasal mucosa, and that PCR negative/IgG+ individuals with high COVID19 clinical suspicion have inflammatory profiles analogous to PCR confirmed disease.",Ben Morton; Kayla Barnes; Catherine Anscombe; Khuzwayo Jere; Comfort Brown; James Nyirenda; Tamara Phiri; Ndaziona Peter Banda; Charlotte Van der veer; Kwazizira Samson Mndolo; Kelvin Mponda; Jamie Rylance; Chimota Phiri; Jane Mallewa; Mulinda Nyirenda; Grace Katha; Paul Kambiya; James Jafali; Henry Mwandumba; Stephen Gordon; Jenifer Cornick; Kondwani Charles Jambo; - Blantyre COVID-19 consortium,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251753,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251753,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
14,Epidemiology of COVID-19 infection amongst workers in Primary Healthcare in Qatar,"Background: COVID-19 transmission was significant amongst Healthcare workers worldwide. Aim: This study aims to estimate the risk of exposure for COVID-19 across Primary Healthcare workers in the State of Qatar. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted to study the burden of COVID-19 among staff working at PHCC during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1 to October 31, 2020. Results: 1,048 (87.4%)of the infected HCWs belonged to the age group below 45 years, and 488 (40.7%) HCWs were females. 450 (37.5%) were HCWs clinical staff working in one of the 27 PHCC HCs; Despite the increased patient footfall and risk environment, the COVID HCs had an attack rate of 10.1%, which is not significantly different from the average attack rate of 8.9% among staff located in other HCs (p-value =0.26).

15,"Moderators of changes in smoking, drinking, and quitting behaviour associated with the first Covid-19 lockdown in England","Aim: To estimate changes in smoking, drinking, and quitting behaviour from before to during the first Covid-19 lockdown in England, and whether changes differed by age, sex, or social grade. Design: Representative cross-sectional surveys of adults, collected monthly between August 2018 and July 2020. Setting: England. Participants: 36,980 adults ([&ge;]18y). Measurements: Independent variables were survey month (pre-lockdown: August-February vs. lockdown months: April-July) and year (pandemic: 2019/20 vs. comparator: 2018/19). Smoking outcomes were smoking prevalence, cessation, quit attempts, quit success, and use of evidence-based or remote cessation support. Drinking outcomes were high-risk drinking prevalence, alcohol reduction attempts, and use of evidence-based or remote support. Moderators were age, sex, and occupational social grade (ABC1=more advantaged/C2DE=less advantaged). Findings: Relative to changes over the same time period in 2018/19, lockdown was associated with significant increases in smoking prevalence (+24.7% in 2019/20 vs. 0.0% in 2018/19, ORadj=1.35[95%CI=1.12-1.63]) and quit attempts (+39.9% vs. -22.2%, ORadj=2.48[1.76-3.50]) among 18-34 year-olds, but not older groups. Increases in cessation (+156.4% vs. -12.5%, ORadj=3.08[1.86-5.09]) and the success rate of quit attempts (+99.2% vs. +0.8%, ORadj=2.29[1.31-3.98]) were also observed, and did not differ significantly by age, sex, or social grade. Lockdown was associated with a significant increase in high-risk drinking prevalence across all sociodemographic groups (+39.5% vs. -7.8%, ORadj=1.80[1.64-1.98]), with particularly high increases among women (ORadj=2.17[1.87-2.53]) and social grades C2DE (ORadj=2.34[2.00-2.74]). Alcohol reduction attempts increased significantly among high-risk drinkers from social grades ABC1 (ORadj=2.31[1.78-3.00]) but not C2DE (ORadj=1.25[0.83-1.88]), with larger increases among those aged 18-34 (ORadj=2.56[1.72-3.81]) and [&ge;]60 (ORadj=1.43[1.05-1.95]) than 35-59 (ORadj=2.51[1.51-4.18]). There were few significant changes in use of support for smoking cessation or alcohol reduction, although samples were small. Conclusions: In England, the first Covid-19 lockdown was associated with increased smoking prevalence among younger adults, and increased high-risk drinking prevalence among all adults. Smoking cessation activity also increased: more younger smokers made quit attempts during lockdown and more smokers quit successfully. Socioeconomic disparities in drinking behaviour were evident: high-risk drinking increased by more among women and those from less advantaged social grades (C2DE) but the rate of reduction attempts increased only among the more advantaged social grades (ABC1).",Sarah E Jackson; Emma Beard; Colin Angus; Matt Field; Jamie Brown,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251766,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251766,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True
16,"Epidemiological, Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Severe Condition and ICU Admission of COVID-19 Patients of Early Stage in China: A review","Objective: Some retrospective studies reporting epidemiological, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients of early stage were published. We aim to provide an overview of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients, and identification, treatment of early stage, especially for the patients with poor prognosis. Data Sources: PubMed, CNKI and Google Scholar. Study Selection: We searched for published retrospective studies that described epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients in China by April 14th, 2020 with search terms. Some studies were excluded according to criteria. Finally, 53 studies were included. Data Extraction: Characteristics of the COVID-19 patients available from included articles were extracted, reorganized and recorded into electronic data forms. Data Synthesis: Characteristics of patients in the included studies were summarized and analyzed for median-interquartile ranges and univariable odds ratio. Conclusion: This study summarized, analyzed and compared epidemiological, clinical characteristics and estimated univariable risk factors among confirmed COVID-19 patients either in former epicenter, in severe condition, with ICU admission or not of early stage. Higher proportions of patients were found to have older age and more comorbidities, typical characteristics on admission and complications either in former epicenter, with severe condition or ICU admission. No evidence showed that patients who were male or had smoking history had higher susceptibility, but they were significant risk factors for severe condition.

17,Interrogating structural inequalities in COVID-19 Mortality in England and Wales,"Background Numerous observational studies have highlighted structural inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in the UK. Such studies often fail to consider the complex spatial nature of such inequalities in their analysis, leading to the potential for bias and an inability to reach conclusions about the most appropriate structural levels for policy intervention. Methods We use publicly available population data on COVID-19 related- and all-cause mortality between March and July 2020 in England and Wales to investigate the spatial scale of such inequalities. We propose a multiscale approach to simultaneously consider four spatial scales at which processes driving inequality may act and apportion inequality between these. Results Adjusting for population age structure, number of care homes and residing in the North we find highest regional inequality in March and June/July. We find finer-grained within-region increased steadily from March until July. The importance of spatial context increases over the study period. No analogous pattern is visible for non-COVID mortality. Higher relative deprivation is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality at all stages of the pandemic but does not explain structural inequalities. Conclusions Results support initial stochastic viral introduction in the South, with initially high inequality decreasing before the establishment of regional trends by June and July, prior to reported regionality of the 'second-wave'. We outline how this framework can help identify structural factors driving such processes, and offer suggestions for a long-term, locally-targeted model of pandemic relief in tandem with regional support to buffer the social context of the area.",Gareth J Griffith; George Davey Smith; David Manley; Laura D Howe; Gwilym Owen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251771,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251771,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True
18,"Are we back to normal yet? The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health with a specific focus on schizotypal traits in the general population of Germany and the UK, comparing responses from April/May vs. September/October","Studies reported a strong impact on mental health during the first wave of the COVID 19 pandemic in March to June, 2020. In this study, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on mental health in general and on schizoptypal traits specifically in general population samples of the UK (N 1st timepoint=239 , N 2nd timepoint= 126) and Germany (N 1st timepoint= 543, N 2nd timepoint=401) over two timepoints, April/May and September/October 2020. We were able to show that whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cutoff for further psychological investigation declined from the first to the second timepoint in both countries, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were increased at the second timepoint. We investigated potential predictors, using regression models. For schizotypy, we detected a doubling or more of the estimated impact from the first to the second timepoint, including stronger perceived loneliness, increased use of drugs, stronger financial burden, and decreased regular exercise and sleep. These effects predicted GSI, however with a lower increase of impact from the first to the second timepoint. We furthermore found that living in the UK was a predictor for higher schizotypal scores or GSI. However, the results are highly comparable between the two countries. In conclusion, this study shows that while the general psychological impact decreases, potentially showing a normative response to an exceptional situation; schizotypy scores increase, revealing a stronger impact of loneliness, drug use, and financial burden. This development might create an increased risk for developing psychosis in some individuals. The development of the general psychological and schizotypy scores over time requires further attention and investigation.",Sarah Daimer; Lorenz Mihatsch; Lisa Ronan; Graham K Murray; Franziska Knolle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251726,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251726,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True
19,Impacts of COVID-19 on long-term health and health care use,"Aim: To explore impacts of mild and severe COVID-19 on acute and long-term utilization of primary care, inpatient- and outpatient specialist health care. Methods: In all persons tested for the SARS-CoV-2 in Norway March 1st to November 1st 2020 (N=1 257 831), we used a difference-in-differences design to contrast the monthly health care use before and after testing, across patients with negative test (no COVID-19) and 1) positive test, not hospitalized (mild COVID-19) and 2) positive test, hospitalized (severe COVID-19). We studied all-cause- and cause-specific health care use for digestive, circulatory, respiratory, endocrine/metabolic/nutritional, genitourinary, eye/ear, musculoskeletal, mental, skin, blood and general/unspecified conditions. Results: Mild COVID-19 impacted on primary care due to respiratory conditions at 0-3 months after having tested positive (786% increase). Severe COVID-19 impacted on visits due to respiratory- (337-3316% increase), circulatory- (166-205% increase), endocrine/metabolic/nutritional- (168-791% increase) as well as visits due to general/unspecified conditions (48-431% increase) in outpatient and inpatient specialist care 0-3 months after being tested. Severe COVID-19 also impacted on outpatient specialist care after 4-6 months, for respiratory and circulatory conditions (199-246% increase) and general/unspecified conditions (40% increase). Conclusion: Our findings imply that mild COVID-19 dos not persist to cause a need for health care beyond two months after having tested positive. Health care contacts increased the most in specialist care for those who had undergone severe COVID-19, both at 0-3 and at 4-6 months.

20,Use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy among Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: A Single-Center Experience,"ABSTRACT: COVID-19 Disease has strained our healthcare system. Convalescent plasma has been used to treat emerging infectious diseases - Influenza A/B, SARS-CoV, Ebola virus and now SARS-CoV 2. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the outcome and clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma transfusion at Cardinal Santos Medical Center. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analytical study of 75 patients who received convalescent plasma. RESULTS: Median time from admission to CP transfusion was 3 days. Majority of patients received additional therapies including dexamethasone (100%); Remdesivir (95%); antibiotics (100%), tocilizumab (65%); hemoperfusion (88%) or combination of these. Among the survivors, the median LOS was 15 days while non-survivors have a median LOS of 6 days. One patient (1.33%) had mild transfusion reaction. Four patients (5.33%) developed DVT despite anti-coagulation. There was improvement in the inflammatory markers (LDH pvalue 0.04, CRP pvalue 0.00, Ferritin pvalue 0.0001). There was improvement in the pulmonary parameters - increase in mean PaO2, mean SaO2, and mean PFR; and decrease in mean FiO2 and mean RR post-treatment. Median LOS is 14 days for the CP group vs 11 days for the non-CP group. Mortality rate among the CP group is 25.33% while the non-CP group was 26.67%. LOS and mortality rate did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in mortality and length of hospital stay in patients given CP vs controls.

21,The efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials,"The novel coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, critically impacting public health systems. Several already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported following the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid hub/PubMed, Scopus, ISI web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg's test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P=0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in the Favipiravir group than in the control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P=0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P=0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between the two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting.",Soheil Hassanpour; Morteza Arab-Zozani; Bahman Amani; Forough Heidarzad; Mohammad Fathalipour; Rudolph Martinez-de-Hoyo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251693,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251693,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True

This protocol is one of the safest, cheapest, and most reproducible approaches for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Furthermore, the RNA obtained using this protocol, minus the pasteurization step, can be sequenced both using a targeted approach sequencing specific regions or the whole genome. The protocol was adopted by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in August 2020 to support their efforts in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater in all five boroughs of the city. Owing to a pasteurization step, it is safe for use in a BSL1+ facility. This step increases the genetic signal of the virus while making the protocol safe for the personnel involved.

23,Overall burden and characteristics of COVID-19 in the United States during 2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health systems and economies throughout the world during 2020 and was particularly devastating for the United States. Many of epidemiological features that produced observed rates of morbidity and mortality have not been thoroughly assessed. Here we use a data-driven model-inference approach to simulate the pandemic at county-scale in the United States during 2020 and estimate critical, time-varying epidemiological properties underpinning the dynamics of the virus. The pandemic in the US during 2020 was characterized by an overall ascertainment rate of 21.6% (95% credible interval (CI):18.9-25.5%). Population susceptibility at year end was 68.8% (63.4-75.3%), indicating roughly one third of the US population had been infected. Community infectious rates, the percentage of people harboring a contagious infection, rose above 0.8% (0.6-1.0%) before the end of the year, and were as high as 2.4% in some major metropolitan areas. In contrast, the infection fatality rate fell to 0.3% by year end; however, community control of transmission, estimated from trends of the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, slackened during successive pandemic waves. In the coming months, as vaccines are distributed and administered and new more transmissible virus variants emerge and spread, greater use of non-pharmaceutical interventions will be needed.",Sen Pei; Teresa K.

27,Should We Delay the Second COVID-19 Vaccine Dose?,"Due to the shortage in COVID-19 vaccine supplies and the alarming sanitary situation engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have opted to delay the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for some period of time, aiming at getting the first dose of the vaccine to a large number of the population, before proceeding with the second doses. This strategy has sparked some heated debates world-wide for its pros and cons, and no clear consensus is reached among experts. Without taking side in this matter, we tried to answer the following question, from a pure mathematical perspective: should we delay the second dose of the vaccine or not?. We show that the answer to this question depends tightly on the efficacy of the first and the second COVID-19 vaccine doses. In particular, if the first dose is more than 50% efficient, the optimal procedure to maximize the number of effectively vaccinated sub-population is to delay the second vaccine as much as possible (the maximum period between the two doses prescribed by the clinical recommendations). On the other hand, if the efficacy of the first dose is less than 50% and the efficacy of the second dose exceeds a certain threshold, then it would be optimal to administer the second dose as quickly as possible (while respecting the minimum period between the two does as prescribed by the clinical recommendations). We provide explicitly the expression of this threshold as a function of the efficacy of first dose.",Intissar Harizi; Soulaimane Berkane; Abdelhamid Tayebi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251652,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251652,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True

29,E484K mutation in SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhances binding affinity with hACE2 but reduces interactions with neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies: Binding free energy calculation studies,"The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 100 million infections and over 2 million deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody drugs design.",Wei Bu Wang; Yu Liang; Yu Qin Jin; Jing Zhang; Ji Guo Su; Qi Ming Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431566,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431566,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
30,Association of CXCR6 with COVID-19 severity: Delineating the host genetic factors in transcriptomic regulation,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that mainly affects the host respiratory system with ~80% asymptomatic or mild cases and ~5% severe cases. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic loci associated with the severe COVID-19 symptoms. Delineating the genetic variants and genes is important for better understanding its biological mechanisms. Methods: We implemented integrative approaches, including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and colocalization analysis, to interpret the genetic risks using two independent GWAS datasets in lung and immune cells. We further performed single cell transcriptomic analysis on a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) dataset from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. Results: We discovered and replicated the genetically regulated expression of CXCR6 and CCR9 genes. These two genes have a protective effect on the lung and a risk effect on whole blood, respectively. The colocalization analysis of GWAS and cis-expression quantitative trait loci highlighted the regulatory effect on CXCR6 expression in lung and immune cells. In the lung resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells, we found a 3.32-fold decrease of cell proportion and lower expression of CXCR6 in the severe than moderate patients using the BALF transcriptomic dataset. Conclusion: CXCR6 from the 3p21.31 locus is associated with severe COVID-19. CXCR6 tends to have a lower expression in lung TRM cells of severe patients, which aligns with the protective effect of CXCR6 from TWAS analysis. We illustrate one potential mechanism of host genetic factor impacting the severity of COVID-19 through regulating the expression of CXCR6 and TRM cell proportion.

31,A measles-vectored COVID-19 vaccine induces long-term immunity and protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice,"In light of the expanding SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, developing efficient vaccines that can provide sufficient coverage for the world population is a global health priority. The measles virus (MV)-vectored vaccine is an attractive candidate given the measles vaccine's extensive safety history, well-established manufacturing process, and induction of strong, long-lasting immunity. We developed an MV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using either the full-length spike (S) or S2 subunit as the antigen. While the S2 antigen failed to induce neutralizing antibodies, the prefusion-stabilized, full-length S (MV-ATU2-SF-2P-dER) construct proved to be an attractive vaccine candidate, eliciting strong Th1-dominant T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses against the S antigen while minimizing reactivity to the vector itself. Neutralizing antibody titers remained high three months after homologous prime-boost immunization, and infectious virus was undetectable in all animals after challenge with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Phanramphoei Namprachan Frantz; Aleksandr Barinov; Claude Ruffié; Chantal Combredet; Valérie Najburg; Samaporn Teeravechyan; Anan Jongkaewwattana; Matthieu Prot; Laurine Conquet; Xavier Montagutelli; Priyanka Fernandes; Hélène Strick-Marchand; James Di Santo; Etienne Simon-Loriere; Christiane Gerke; Frédéric Tangy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431630,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431630,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
32,A selective sweep in the Spike gene has driven SARS-CoV-2 human adaptation,"While SARS-CoV-2 likely has animal origins, the viral genetic changes necessary to adapt this animal-derived ancestral virus to humans are largely unknown, mainly due to low levels of sequence polymorphism and the notorious difficulties in experimental manipulations of coronavirus genomes. We scanned more than 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for selective sweep signatures and found that a distinct footprint of positive selection is located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the Receptor-Binding Domain of the Spike protein, which likely played a critical role in overcoming species barriers and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans. Structural analysis indicated that the substitution of threonine with alanine in SARS-CoV-2 concomitantly removes a predicted glycosylation site at N370, resulting in more favorable binding predictions to human ACE2, the cellular receptor. Using a novel bacteria-free cloning system for manipulating RNA virus genomes, we experimentally validated that this SARS-CoV-2-unique substitution significantly increases replication in human cells relative to its putative ancestral variant. Notably, this mutation's impact on virus replication in human cells was much more significant than that of the Spike D614G mutant, which has been widely reported to have been selected for during human-to-human transmission.",Lin Kang; Guijuan He; Amanda K.

33,Delayed induction of type I and III interferons and nasal epithelial cell permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2,"The nasal epithelium is a plausible entry point for SARS-CoV-2, a site of pathogenesis and transmission, and may initiate the host response to SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral interferon responses are critical to outcome of SARS-CoV-2. Yet little is known about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity in this tissue. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics to a primary cell model of human primary nasal epithelium differentiated at air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated widespread tropism for nasal epithelial cell types. The host response was dominated by type I and III IFNs and interferon-stimulated gene products. Nevertheless, this response was notably delayed in onset compared to viral gene expression, and thus failed to impact substantially on SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, when provided prior to infection, recombinant IFN{beta} or IFN{lambda}1 induced an efficient antiviral state that potently restricted SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, preserving epithelial barrier integrity. These data suggest nasal delivery of recombinant IFNs to be a potential chemoprophylactic strategy.",Catherine F Hatton; Rachel A Botting; Maria Emilia Duenas; Iram J Haq; Bernard Verdon; Benjamin J Thompson; Jarmila Stremenova Spegarova; Florian Gothe; Emily A Stephenson; Aaron I Gardner; Sandra Murphy; Jonathan Scott; James P Garnett; Sean Carrie; Rafiqul Hussain; Jonathan Coxhead; Tracey Davey; John Simpson; Muzlifah Haniffa; Sophie Hambleton; Malcolm Brodlie; Chris Ward; Matthias Trost; Gary Reynolds; Christopher J A Duncan,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431591,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431591,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
34,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induces neutralizing antibodies against pandemic and pre-emergent SARS-related coronaviruses in monkeys,"Betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, and now the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs circulating in animals have the potential to prevent future betaCoV pandemics. Here, we show that immunization of macaques with a multimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) nanoparticle adjuvanted with 3M-052-Alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, batCoVs and the UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus. Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization titer of 47,216, and robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric RBD protein also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-neutralizing antibodies, albeit at lower titers. These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may provide some protection from future zoonotic betaCoV outbreaks, and provide a platform for further development of pan-betaCoV nanoparticle vaccines.",Kevin O Saunders; Esther Lee; Robert Parks; David R Martinez; Dapeng Li; Haiyan Chen; Robert J Edwards; Sophie M.

35,Structural and functional ramifications of antigenic drift in recent SARS-CoV-2 variants,"The protective efficacy of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited during natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and by vaccination based on its spike protein has been compromised with emergence of the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Residues E484 and K417 in the receptor-binding site (RBS) are both mutated in lineages first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (B.1.1.28.1). The nAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 patients are preferentially encoded by certain heavy-chain germline genes and the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2) can each bind the RBS in two different binding modes. However, their binding and neutralization are abrogated by either the E484K or K417N mutation, whereas nAbs to the cross-reactive CR3022 and S309 sites are largely unaffected. This structural and functional analysis illustrates why mutations at E484 and K417 adversely affect major classes of nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 with consequences for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.",Meng Yuan; Deli Huang; Chang-Chun D.

36,A rigorous framework for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutational ensemble from genomic and structural features,"The recent release of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from several countries has provided clues into the potential antigenic drift of the coronavirus population. In particular, the genomic instability observed in the spike protein necessitates immediate action and further exploration in the context of viral-host interactions. Here we dynamically track 3,11,795 genome sequences of spike protein, which comprises 2,584 protein mutations. We reveal mutational genomic ensemble at different timing and geographies, that evolves on four distinct residues. In addition to the well-established N501 mutational cluster, we detect the presence of three novel clusters, namely A222, N439, and S477. The robust examination of structural features from 44 known cryo-EM structures showed that the virus is deploying many mutations within these clusters on structurally heterogeneous regions. One such dominant variant D614G was also simulated using molecular dynamics simulations and, as compared to wild-type, we found higher stability with human ACE2 receptor. There is also a significant overlap of mutational clusters on known epitopes, indicating putative interference with antibody binding. Thus, we propose that the resulting coaxility of mutational clusters is the most efficient feature of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and provides precise mutant combinations that can enable future vaccine re-positioning.",Saman Fatihi; Surabhi Rathore; Ankit Pathak; Deepanshi Gahlot; Mitali Mukerji; Nidhi Jatana; Lipi Thukral,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431625,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431625,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
37,"Multiple Sites on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein are Susceptible to Proteolysis by Cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V","SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID-19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated.",Keval Bollavaram; Tiffanie Leeman; Akhil Kulkarni; Sophia Upshaw; Maggie Lee; Jiabei Yang; Hannah Song; Manu O Platt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431617,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431617,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
38,How the replication and transcription complex of SARS-CoV-2 functions in leader-to-body fusion,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although unprecedented efforts are underway to develop therapeutic strategies against this disease, scientists have acquired only a little knowledge regarding the structures and functions of the CoV replication and transcription complex (RTC) and 16 non-structural proteins, named NSP1-16. Results: In the present study, we determined the theoretical arrangement of NSP12-16 in the global RTC structure. This arrangement answered how the CoV RTC functions in the ""leader-to-body fusion"" process. More importantly, our results revealed the associations between multiple functions of the RTC, including RNA synthesis, NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation, and CoV replication and transcription at the molecular level. As the most important finding, transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) hairpins were reported for the first time to help understand the multiple functions of CoV RTCs and the strong recombination abilities of CoVs. Conclusions: TRS hairpins can be used to identify recombination regions in CoV genomes. We provide a systematic understanding of the structures and functions of the RTC, leading to the eventual determination of the global CoV RTC structure. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, providing a basis for future studies. Future drug design targeting SARS-CoV-2 needs to consider protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in the RTC, particularly the complex structure of NSP15 and NSP16 with the TRS hairpin.",Xin Li; Qiang Zhao; Jia Chang; Guangyou Duan; Jinlong Bei; Tung On Yau; Jianyi Yang; Jishou Ruan; Bingjun He; Gao Shan,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431652,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431652,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False

A previously developed thermodynamic model of protein conformations predicted that SARS CoV-2 is very close to a thermodynamic critical point, which makes it highly infectious but also easily displaced by a spike-based vaccine because there is a tradeoff between transmissibility and robustness. The model identified a small cluster of four key mutations of SARS CoV-2 that promotes much stronger viral attachment and viral spreading. Here we apply the model to two new strains (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) and predict, using no free parameters, how the new mutations can further enhance infectiousness.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431437,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431437,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
40,Traditional use of Cissampelos pareira L. for hormone disorder and fever provides molecular links of ESR1 modulation to viral inhibition,"In traditional systems, a single herbal formulation is often used in the treatment of diverse diseases, including some that are newly emergent and prevalent today. We provide here a multi-omics framework to probe the molecular basis of a multicomponent example herb, Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) used in the treatment of hormonal disorders and fever in Ayurveda. Cipa treated MCF7 cells exhibit downregulation of signatures of estrogen response. 38 constituent molecules in Cipa potentially bind ({triangleup}G< -7.5) with ER at the same site as estrogen. Cipa transcriptome signatures in the connectivity map exhibit positive scores with protein translation inhibitors and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response. This includes the knockdown signature of RPL7, a coactivator of ESRI with a connectivity score > 99.69. This axis was found to be upregulated in the COVID-19 patient transcriptome. The antiviral activity through ESR1 modulation was validated in the DENV-2 infection model. We further observed 98% inhibition of SARs-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. A few of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. This study provides a novel framework for querying the molecular links of multicomponent Ayurveda formulations and explains their use in the treatment of disparate diseases.

The structures of immunogens to elicit most potent neutralization antibodies are still under investigation. Here we tested the immunogenicity of the trimeric, full length Spike protein with 2 proline mutations to preserve its prefusion conformation. Recombinant trimeric Spike protein expressed by CHO cells was used with polyI:C (PIKA) adjuvant to immunize mice by 0-7-14 day schedule. The results showed that Spike-specific antibody was induced at day 21 with titer of more than 50,000 in average as measured by direct binding to Spike protein. The titer of neutralization reached more than 1000 in average when tested by a pseudo-virus system, using monoclonal antibodies (40592-MM57 and 40591-MM43) with neutralizing IC50 at 1 microgram/ml as standards. Protein/peptide array showed that the antibodies induced by trimeric S protein vaccine bind similarly to natural infection with the receptor binding domain (RBD) as major immunodominant region. No linear epitopes were found in RBD, although several linear epitopes were found in C-terminal domain right after RBD, and heptad repeat regions.

42,Community end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial findings of a UK primary care survey,"BackgroundThousands of people in the UK have required end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary healthcare teams (general practice and community nursing services) have provided the majority of this care, alongside specialist colleagues. There is a need to learn from this experience in order to inform future service delivery and planning.

AimTo understand the views of general practitioners and community nurses providing end-of-life care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design and SettingA web-based, UK-wide questionnaire survey circulated via professional general practice and community nursing networks during September and October 2020.

MethodResponses were analysed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsValid responses were received from 559 individuals (387 community nurses, 156 General Practitioners (GPs) and 16 unspecified role), from all regions of the UK. The majority reported increased involvement in providing community end-of-life care. Contrasting and potentially conflicting roles emerged between GPs and community nurses. There was increased use of remote consultations, particularly by GPs. Community nurses took greater responsibility in most aspects of end-of-life care practice, particularly face-to-face care, but reported feeling isolated. For some GPs and community nurses, there has been considerable emotional distress.

ConclusionPrimary healthcare services are playing a critical role in meeting increased need for end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have adapted rapidly, but the significant emotional impact, especially for community nurses, needs addressing alongside rebuilding trusting and supportive team dynamics.

43,Workplace measures against COVID-19 during the winter third wave in Japan: company size-based differences,"ObjectivesLittle is known about workplace measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan after the first state of emergency period, especially in micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti-COVID-19 measures in Japanese enterprises, considering company size.

MethodsThis study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the p-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes.

ResultsFor the 27,036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working and restricting eating and drinking at personal workspaces were implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 15% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all p-values < .001).

ConclusionsWe found that various responses to COVID-19 had been taken in workplaces. However, some measures, including remote working, were still not well implemented, especially in smaller enterprises.

44,An alternative approach for bioanalytical assay development for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2,"Wastewater-based epidemiology could be applied to track down SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at high spatio-temporal resolution and could potentially be used as an early-warning for emergence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the general population. Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in monitoring the spread of the virus in the population and controlling possible outbreaks. However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW).

Unlike predecessors, method development of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads (in combination with seeding IWW with a surrogate coronavirus). This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,...). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering pore sizes did not improve our limit of detection and quantification. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E_Sarbeco-gene.

This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. Interestingly, qPCR results were comparable with dPCR results suggesting that qPCR is a valid method. In this study, dPCR was also used as a proxy to assess the precision of qPCR. In this light, dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/{micro}L), indicating that variability in bioanalytical assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be substantial.

On average, the N2-gene showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 {degrees}C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene in IWW.

Although WBE can already aid in filling some knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, future WBE studies should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with regards to methodological limitations.

45,"Responsive caregiving, opportunities for early learning, and children's safety and security during COVID-19: A rapid review","IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life and programs and services that promote and protect early childhood development. Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting childrens development.

MethodologyThis rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and childrens safety and security.

ResultsThere are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education.

ConclusionThe findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for action-oriented implementation studies - those that go beyond identifying trends and begin to pinpoint ""what works"" to effectively promote and protect nurturing care during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSThe most fundamental promotive experiences in the early years of life to reach optimal development come from nurturing care and protection received from parents, family, and community, which have lifelong benefits including improved health and wellbeing. Health and other emergencies are detrimental to the provision of nurturing care.

What are the new findings?Findings from this rapid review reveal numerous areas of concern, including families reporting mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. As with other features of this pandemic, not all families are affected equally: financially vulnerable families are much more likely to experience negative ramifications. The pandemic is also disproportionately affecting parents and other caregivers with young children, particularly mothers, those with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and those caring for children with disabilities.

46,Fear and death anxiety among Latin American doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Introduction: A patient s death elicits various feelings arise in doctors such as impotence and guilt that could trigger physical or psychological symptoms. Despite its impact, few studies have explored anxiety and fear of death among physicians. Objective: To evaluate perceptions and responses to one s mortality among Latin American physicians treating COVID-19 patients. Methodology: This cross-sectional study utilized the Collet-Lester Modified Fear of Death Scale and the Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) to collect data from physicians in Latin America. Results: 219 doctors from Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Bolivia filled out the online questionnaire. Fear of death among the sample population ranged from 56.2% to 90%. Furthermore, the prevalence of ""High Anxiety"" was 80.8%. A statistically significant association was found between fear according to age and time of graduation (p = 0.010 and p = 0.020, respectively). No differences were found by gender, age, and country of origin or practice. Conclusion: Physicians experience feelings of helplessness and guilt upon the death of a patient and those feelings can trigger physical or psychological symptoms. For these states of fear and anxiety about death, more frequent in times of pandemic, doctors must be prepared, and institutions must provide them with the necessary means to help them overcome these difficult times.",Sonia Indacochea; Jenny Raquel Torres-Malca; Victor Juan Vera-Ponce; Miguel A.

47,A multi-centre service evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation of newly diagnosed cancers and type 1 diabetes in children in the UK,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in patterns of presentation to Emergency Departments (ED). Child health professionals were concerned that this could contribute to the delayed diagnosis of life-threatening conditions, including childhood cancer (CC) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Our multicentre, UK-based service evaluation assessed diagnostic intervals and disease severity for these conditions.

MethodsWe collected presentation route, timing and disease severity for children with newly diagnosed CC in three principal treatment centres, and T1DM in four centres between 1st January - 31st July 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We assessed the impact of lockdown on total diagnostic interval (TDI), patient interval (PI), system interval (SI) and disease severity.

FindingsFor CCs and T1DM, the route to diagnosis and severity of illness at presentation were unchanged across all time periods. Diagnostic intervals for CCs during lockdown were comparable to that in 2019 (TDI 4.6, PI 1.1 and SI 2.1 weeks), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 2.7 weeks). Diagnostic intervals for T1DM during lockdown were similar to that in 2019 (TDI 16 vs 15 and PI 14 vs 14 days), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 21 days).

InterpretationThere is no evidence of diagnostic delay or increased illness severity for CC or T1DM, during the first phase of the pandemic across the participating centres. This provides reassuring data for children and families with these life-changing conditions.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThis project was initiated after the first national lockdown in March 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. At the design stage, Medline was searched (with no language limit), using the keywords ((Cancer) OR (neoplasm) OR (Type 1 diabetes mellitus)) AND ((Covid-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2) OR (Pandemics)) AND ((Emergency department attendances) OR (diabetes ketoacidosis) OR (Delayed diagnosis) OR (interval) OR (wait)) to identify publications reporting the impact of the pandemic and public health measures on both overall and paediatric healthcare services. Significant changes in service utilisation in the UK were reported following the commencement of the first lockdown, including a 49% reduction in emergency department attendances in the week following the lockdown; and two adult studies reported that referral via the urgent two-week wait cancer referral diagnoses decreased by 84% from Mar-May and 60% in June 2020. As for Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), a 30 patient UK-study reported an increase in newly diagnosed T1DM during the first six weeks of lockdown. Increased proportions of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation were also reported in an Italian survey involving 53 paediatric diabetes centres. Through the search we identified a need for multi-centre, more thorough assessment on referral pathways, time taken from symptom onset to diagnosis, and its association with severity at presentation for children diagnosed with life-changing conditions during the national lockdown.

Added value of this studyOur findings suggest that the first national lockdown in the UK were not associated with delayed diagnosis of childhood cancer or type 1 diabetes at participating centres. This provides reassuring information for children and families with these life-changing conditions.

ImplicationWe believe that our study can play a key role in allaying parental and professional concern. it is important to establish whether subsequent public health measures have impacted the diagnostic interval in the context of an evolving backlog of patient referrals across the UK.",- COVID-19 Pandemic UK-based Interest Group of Childhood Cancer and Diabetes; Gemma Williams; Ross McLean; Jo-Fen Liu; Timoth Ritzmann; Madhumita Dandapani; Pooja Sachdev; Mark Brougham; Rod Mitchell; Nicholas T Conway; James Law; Alice Cunnington; Gbemi Ogunnaike; Karen Brougham; Elizabeth Bayman; David A Walker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251149,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251149,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
48,SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays in serial samples reveal earlier seroconversion in acutely ill COVID-19 patients developing ARDS,"ObjectivesDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has been suggested for (1) screening populations for disease prevalence, (2) diagnostics, and (3) guiding therapeutic applications. Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts.

Methods443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).

ResultsMedian seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9 %) compared to all other assays ([&ge;]98.8 %) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8 %) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100 %).

50,"Changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain","BackgroundWe aimed to examine main changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19.

MethodsWe used prospective data from 3041 participants in four cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged [&ge;]65 years in Spain. Data were obtained using validated questionnaires through a pre-pandemic face-to-face interview and a telephone interview conducted between weeks 7 to 15 after the beginning the COVID-19 lockdown. Lineal or multinomial, as appropriate, regression models with adjustment for the main confounders were used to assess changes in the outcome variables from the pre-pandemic to the confinement period, and to identify their associated factors.

ResultsOn average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Several subgroups of individuals were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health decline with confinement: (i)-males (for physical activity and sedentariness), (ii)-those with greater social isolation (for diet, physical activity, mental health), (iii)-feelings of loneliness (for diet, sleep quality, mental health), (iv)-poor housing conditions (for diet, physical activity, TV viewing time), (v)-unhealthy sleep duration (for physical activity and sedentariness), and (vi-worse overall health or chronic morbidities (for physical activity, screen time, mental health). On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement.

ConclusionsThe lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 in Spain, which was one of the most restrictive in Europe, only led to minor average changes in health behaviors among older adults. However, mental health was moderately affected. If another lockdown were imposed on this or future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals with male sex, greater social isolation, poor housing conditions and chronic morbidities, because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions",Esther Garcia-Esquinas; Rosario Ortol; Iago Gine-Vazquez; Jose A Carnicero; Asier Manas; Elvira Lara; Alejandro Alvarez-Bustos; German Vicente-Rodriguez; Mercedes Sotos-Prieto; Beatriz Olaya; Francisco Jose Garcia-Garcia; Narcis Gusi; Jose R Banegas; Irene Rodriguez-Gomez; Ellen A Struijk; David Martinez-Gomez; Alberto Lana; Josep Maria Haro; Jose L Ayuso-Mateos; Leocadio Rodriguez-Manas; Ignacio Ara; Marta Miret; Fernando Rodriguez-Artalejo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251738,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251738,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
51,Transfer learning via multi-scale convolutional neural layers for human-virus protein-protein interaction prediction,"To predict interactions between human and viral proteins, we combine evolutionary sequence profile features with a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Our architecture outperforms various feature encodings-based machine learning and state-of-the-art prediction methods. As our main contribution, we introduce two types of transfer learning methods (i.e.,  frozen type and  fine-tuning type) that reliably predict interactions in a target human-virus domain based on training in a source human-virus domain, by retraining CNN layers. Our transfer learning strategies can effectively apply prior knowledge transfer from large source dataset/task to small target dataset/task to improve prediction performance. Finally, we utilize the  frozen type of transfer learning to predict human-SARS-CoV-2 PPIs, indicating that our predictions are topologically and functionally similar to experimentally known interactions.",Xiaodi Yang; Shiping Yang; Xianyi Lian; Stefan Wuchty; Ziding Zhang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431420,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431420,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False
52,A glycan gate controls opening of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded (down) to an exposed (up) state in order to bind the human ACE2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the up and down states have been obtained by cryoEM and cryoET, details of the RBD opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here, over 200 s of weighted ensemble (WE) simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD opening pathways. Together with biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408, and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein achieves a new high-water mark for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection.",Terra E Sztain; Surl-Hee Ahn; Anthony T.

53,A chicken IgY can efficiently inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the ACE2 binding domain in vitro,"COVID-19 pneumonia is spreading widely in the world now. Currently, no specific antiviral drugs have been developed. The vaccine is the most effective way to control the epidemic. Passive immune antibodies are also an effective method to prevent and cure COVID-19 pneumonia. We used SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD as an antigen to immunize layers in order to extract, separate and purify SARS-CoV-2-IgY from egg yolk. SARS-CoV-2-IgY(S-IgY) can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the Cells and reduce the viral load in cells. The EC50 of W3-IgY (S-IgY in the third week after immunization) is1.35 {+/-} 0.15nM. The EC50 of W9-IgY (S-IgYin the ninth week after immunization) is 2.76 {+/-} 1.54 nM. When the dose of S-IgY is 55 nM, the fluorescence representing intracellular viral protein is obviously weakenedin Immunofluorescence microscopy.

Results of Sars-CoV-2 /VeroE6 cell experiment confirmed that S-IgY had strong antiviral effecton SARS-Co-V-2, and its EC50 is 27.78 {+/-} 1.54nM vs 3259 {+/-} 159.62 nM of Redesivir (differ>106 times, P<0.001).

S-IgY can inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, which is related to its targeting the ACE2 binding domain.

S-IgY is safe, efficient, stable and easy to obtain. This antibody may have the potential to be an effective method for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

54,Characterization of humoral and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in people living with HIV,"There is an urgent need to understand the nature of immune responses generated against SARS-CoV-2, to better inform risk-mitigation strategies for people living with HIV (PLWH). Although not all PLWH are considered immunosuppressed, residual cellular immune deficiency and ongoing inflammation could influence COVID-19 disease severity, the evolution and durability of protective memory responses. Here, we performed an integrated analysis, characterizing the nature, breadth and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in PLWH, controlled on ART, and HIV negative subjects. Both groups were in the convalescent phase of predominately mild COVID-19 disease. The majority of PLWH mounted SARS-CoV-2 Spike- and Nucleoprotein-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, as measured by ELISpot, at levels comparable to HIV negative subjects. T cell responses against Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid were the most prominent, with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells outnumbering CD8 T cells. Notably, the overall magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses related to the size of the naive CD4 T cell pool and the CD4:CD8 ratio in PLWH, in whom disparate antibody and T cell responses were observed. Both humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 were detected at 5-7 months post-infection, providing evidence of medium-term durability of responses irrespective of HIV serostatus. Incomplete immune reconstitution on ART and a low CD4:CD8 ratio could, however, hamper the development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and serve as a useful tool for risk stratification of PLWH. These findings have implications for the individual management and potential effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PLWH.

Despite immune dysfunction and immunosuppressive treatment, JIA, JDM and JSLE patients mounted comparable or stronger responses than healthier peers, dominated by IgG antibodies to HCoV-OC43 spike, and harboured IgG antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike. In contrast, responses to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins exhibited delayed age-dependent class-switching and were not elevated in JIA, JDM and JSLE patients, arguing against increased exposure.

However, no live attenuated vaccine has been developed yet, despite their generally high efficacy. Here, we established temperature-sensitive mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2, whose growth was significantly slower than that of the parent strain at 37{degrees}C. One of the strains, A50-18, which presented mutations in nonstructural protein 14, did not replicate at all at 37{degrees}C in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that this strain replicated inefficiently in the lungs of Syrian hamsters, and intra-nasal inoculation induced sufficient anti-SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies to protect against wild type virus infection. These results suggest that the A50-18 strain could be a promising live attenuated vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

59,"Single-Domain SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD Antibodies Isolated from Immunized Llama Effectively Bind Targets of the Wuhan, UK, and South African Strains in vitro","The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 variants has become a major challenge of the current fight against the pandemic. Of particular concerns are the strains that have arisen from the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa. The UK variant spreads rapidly and is projected to overtake the original strain in the US as early as in March 2021, while the South African variant appears to evade some effects of the current vaccines. Potential false-negative diagnosis using currently available antigen kits that may not recognize these variants could cause another wave of community infection. Therefore, it is imperative that antibodies used in the detection kits are validated for binding against these variants. Here we report that the nanoantibodies (nAbs in our terminology, also referred to as VHH fragments, single domain antibodies, nanobodiesTM) that we have developed for rapid antigen detection test bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein from the original COVID-SARS-2 virus as well as those from the UK and South African variants.

60,The Host Interactome of Spike Expands the Tropism of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) and has rapidly created a global pandemic. Patients that survive may face a slow recovery with long lasting side effects that can afflict different organs. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial airway cells that express the host entry receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) which binds to spike protein trimers on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions. However, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other tissues even though they are negative for ACE2. To gain insight into the molecular constituents that might influence SARS-CoV-2 tropism, we determined which additional host factors engage with the viral spike protein in disease-relevant human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBEo-). We found that spike recruited the extracellular proteins laminin and thrombospondin and was retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) by the proteins DJB11 and FBX2 which support re-folding or degradation of nascent proteins in the ER. Because emerging mutations of the spike protein potentially impact the virus tropism, we compared the interactome of D614 spike with that of the rapidly spreading G614 mutated spike. More D614 than G614 spike associated with the proteins UGGT1, calnexin, HSP7A and GRP78/BiP which ensure glycosylation and folding of proteins in the ER. In contrast to G614 spike, D614 spike was endoproteolytically cleaved, and the N-terminal S1 domain was degraded in the ER even though C-terminal S2-only proteoforms remained present. D614 spike also bound more laminin than G614 spike, which suggested that extracellular laminins may function as co-factors for an alternative, S2-only dependent virus entry. Because the host interactome determines whether an infection is productive, we developed a novel proteome-based cell type set enrichment analysis (pCtSEA). With pCtSEA we determined that the host interactome of the spike protein may extend the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 beyond mucous epithelia to several different cell types, including macrophages and epithelial cells in the nephron. An S2-only dependent, alternative infection of additional cell types with SARS-CoV-2 may impact vaccination strategies and may provide a molecular explanation for a severe or prolonged progression of disease in select COVID-19 patients.",Tom Casimir Bamberger; Sandra Pankow; Salvador Martinez-Bartolome; Jolene Diedrich; Robin Park; John Robert Yates III,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431318,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431318,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False

As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drug's properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drug's P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.",Elena Arutyunova; Muhammad Bashir Khan; Conrad Fischer; Jimmy Lu; Tess Lamer; Wayne Vuong; Marco J van Belkum; Ryan T McKay; D.

62,Endothelial cells elicit a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-COV-2 without productive viral infection,"Thrombotic and microvascular complications are frequently seen in deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting that vascular pathology is a major driver of severe disease. However, whether this is caused by direct viral infection of the endothelium or inflammation-induced endothelial activation remains highly contentious. What role the endothelium plays in viral amplification and inflammation thus remains a key unresolved question in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use patient autopsy samples, primary human endothelial cells and an in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial cell barrier to show that primary human endothelial cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2, albeit at low levels. Accordingly, when present in a sufficiently high concentration, SARS-CoV-2 can enter primary human endothelial cells from either the apical or basolateral surface. Whilst inducing an inflammatory response, this is not a productive infection. We further demonstrate that in a co-culture model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier, endothelial cells are not infected with SARS-CoV-2. They do however, sense and respond to an infection in the adjacent epithelial cells, resulting in the induction of a pro-inflammatory response. Taken together, these data suggest that in vivo, endothelial cells are unlikely to be infected with SARSCoV-2 and that infection is only likely to occur if the adjacent pulmonary epithelium is denuded (basolateral infection) or a high viral load is present in the blood (apical infection). In such a scenario, whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection of the endothelium can occur, it does not contribute to viral amplification. However, endothelial cells are still likely to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by sensing and mounting a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2.",Lilian Schimmel; Keng Yih Chew; Claudia Stocks; Teodor Yordanov; Tish Essebier; Arutha Kulasinghe; James Monkman; Anna Flavia Ribeiro dos Santos Miggiolaro; Lucia De Noronha; Anne K Lagendijk; Kate Schroder; Larisa Labzin; Emma J Gordon; Kirsty R Short,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431177,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431177,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False
63,"The impact of armed conflict on the epidemiological situation of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Libya, Syria, and Yemen.","BackgroundSince the Arab uprising 2011, Libya, Syria, and Yemen have gone through a major armed conflict. This resulted in a high rate of mortality, injury, and population displacement with a collapse of the health care system. Furthermore, it was complicated by the emergence of, COVID-19 as a global pandemic which made the population of these countries strive under unusual conditions to tackle both the pandemic and the ongoing wars. The objectives of this study were to determine the impacts and influence of armed conflicts on the epidemiology of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) within these war-torn countries and outline the needed strategies to combat the spread of the pandemic and its upcoming consequences.

MethodsThe official and public data regarding the dynamics of armed conflict and the spread, of SARS-COV-19 in Libya, Syria, and Yemen were collected from all available sources. Starting from the early emergence of the COVID-19 in each country until the end of December 2020. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques and the weekly resolved data were used to probe the link between the intensity levels of the armed conflict and the spread of the pandemic.

ResultsData indicated that there is an increase in the intensity of violence levels at an early stage from March to August reached up to two folds in the three countries particularly in Libya. In this violent period, few cases of COVID-19 were reported ranging from 5-53 cases/day. From September to December, a significant decline in the level of the armed conflict was accompanied by steep upsurges in the number of reported COVID-19 cases reached up to 500 cases/day. The highest accumulative cases of COVID-19 were reported in Libya, Syria, and Yemen respectively.

ConclusionsOur analysis demonstrates that the armed conflict has provided an opportunity for SARS-COV-19 to spread. At the early weeks of the pandemic that coincided with high levels of the armed conflict few cases were officially reported indicating a vast undercount, which may suggest a hidden mitigating spread at an early stage. Then the pandemic increased immensely as the armed conflict decline to reach the highest by December. A full-blown transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic in these countries is expected. Therefore, urgent national and international strategies should be implemented to combat the pandemic and its upcoming consequences.",Mohamed A Daw Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251654,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251654,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
64,"Mortality from injury, overdose and suicide during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, March-July, 2020","Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with substantial rates of all-cause excess mortality. The contribution of external causes of death to excess mortality including drug overdose, homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries during the initial outbreak in the United States is less well documented.

MethodsUsing public data published by the National Center for Health Statistics on February 10, 2021, we measured monthly excess mortality (the gap between observed and expected deaths) from five external causes using national-level data published by National Center for Health Statistics; assault (homicide); intentional self-harm (suicide); accidents (unintentional injuries); and motor vehicle accidents. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) models developed with cause-specific monthly mortality counts and US population data from 2015-2019 and estimated the contribution of individual cause-specific mortality to all-cause excess mortality from March-July 2020.

ResultsFrom March-July, 2020, 212,825 (95% CI 136,236-290,776) all-cause excess deaths occurred in the US). There were 8,540 excess drug overdoses (all intents) (95% CI 5,106 to 11,975), accounting for 4% of all excess mortality; 1,455 excess homicide deaths (95% CI 708 to 2202, accounting for 0.7% of excess mortality; 5,492 excess deaths due to unintentional accidents occurred (95% CI 85 to 10,899, accounting for 2.6% of excess mortality. Though a non-significantly 135 (95% CI -1361 to 1,630) more MVA deaths were recorded during the study period, a significant decrease in April (525; 95% CI -817 to -233) and significant increases in June-July (965; 95% CI 348 to 1,587) were observed. Suicide deaths were statistically lower than projected by 2,067 (95% CI 941-3,193 fewer deaths).

MeaningExcess deaths from drug overdoses, homicide, and addicents occurred during the pandemic but represented a small fraction of all-cause excess mortality. The excess external causes of death, however, still represent thousands of lives lost. Notably, deaths from suicide were lower than expected and therefore did not contribute to excess mortality.",Jeremy Faust; Chengan Du; Katherine Mayes; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Michael L Barnett; Harlan M Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251682,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251682,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
65,Severe COVID-19 pneumonia and barotrauma: From the frying pan into the fire.,"AimCOVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS (C-ARDS) has a high mortality. Preliminary reports indicate a higher incidence of barotrauma in patients with C-ARDS[1] both on invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) This study examines the incidence and risk factors for barotrauma and change in outcomes after barotrauma in patients with severe C-ARDS on positive pressure respiratory support (PPRS).

Methods and materialsThis is a retrospective study of C-ARDS associated barotrauma over 5 months in patients on PPRS in a tertiary COVID care center. The type of barotrauma, intervention, related factors, such as type of respiratory support (iMV vs NIV), airway pressure prior to the occurrence of barotrauma, and post-barotrauma outcomes were analyzed.

ResultsA total of 38/410 (9.3%) C-ARDS patients on PPRS [mean age 57.82 {+/-} 13.3 years, 32 males (84.2%)] developed barotrauma. Of these, 20 patients (52.6%) were on NIV and 18 (47.4%) patients were iMV on standard recommended settings. The median P/F ratio of patients on MV at the time of barotrauma was 116.4 (IQR 72.4, 193.25). The details of barotrauma were as follows: 24 patients had pneumothorax (PTX), 2 had pneumo-mediastinum and 12 had subcutaneous emphysema. Overall, 24/38 (63.2%) patients, including 15/18 (83.3%) on MV succumbed to their illness. The barotrauma happened a median of 6.5 days (IQR 4.75,13) after admission and 15 days (IQR 10.25,18.0) from symptom onset. The median duration from barotrauma to death was 7 days (IQR 2.25, 8.0) and barotrauma to discharge (for survivors) was 12.5 days (IQR 8.0, 21.25). All patients received steroids and 11/38 (28.9%) received additional immunosuppression with tocilizumab.

ConclusionA high incidence of barotrauma was seen in this large series of severe C-ARDS patients on PPRS. Barotrauma led to further deterioration in the clinical status leading to a fatal outcome in the majority of the MV patients, despite prompt treatment.",Hariprasad Kalpakam; Sameer Bansal; Nithya .

66,An analysis of school absences in England during the Covid-19 pandemic,"The introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, in the UK in early 2020, resulted in the UK government introducing several control policies in order to reduce the spread of disease. As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally all school children returned to the classroom in September. In this paper, we analyse the data on school absences from September 2020 to December 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Educational Settings database compiled by the Department for Education and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools. Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers were seen to decline during the November lockdown, particularly in those regions that had previously been in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first two weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences owing to confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be significantly lower than in secondary schools across all regions and tiers. In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and Greater London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in cases in secondary schools. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. We conclude that there is not significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a significant role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.",Emma R Southall; Alex Holmes; Edward M Hill; Benjamin D Atkins; Trystan Leng; Robin N Thompson; Louise J Dyson; Matt J Keeling; Michael Tildesley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251484,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251484,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
67,Anterior nasal versus nasal mid-turbinate sampling for a SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test: does localisation or professional collection matter?,"ObjectivesThe aim of this diagnostic accuracy study was direct comparison of two different nasal sampling methods for an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) that detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the accuracy and feasibility of self-sampling was evaluated.

MethodsThis manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, compared professional anterior nasal (AN) and nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) sampling for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. A second group of participants collected a NMT sample themselves and underwent a professional nasopharyngeal swab for comparison. The reference standard was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sampling. Individuals with high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement were calculated. Self-sampling was observed without intervention. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires.

ResultsAmong 132 symptomatic adults, both professional AN- and NMT-sampling yielded a sensitivity of 86.1% (31/36 RT-PCR positives detected; 95%CI: 71.3-93.9) and a specificity of 100.0% (95%CI: 95.7-100). The positive percent agreement (PPA) was 100% (95%CI: 89.0-100). Among 96 additional adults, self NMT- and professional NP-sampling yielded an identical sensitivity of 91.2% (31/34; 95%CI 77.0-97.0). Specificity was 98.4% (95%CI: 91.4-99.9) with NMT- and 100.0% (95%CI: 94.2-100) with NP-sampling. The PPA was 96.8% (95%CI: 83.8-99.8). Most participants (85.3%) considered self-sampling as easy to perform.

ConclusionProfessional AN- and NMT-sampling are of equivalent accuracy for an Ag-RDT in ambulatory symptomatic adults. Participants were able to reliably perform the NMT-sampling themselves, following written and illustrated instructions. Nasal self-sampling will likely facilitate scaling of SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing.",Olga Nikolai; Chiara Rohardt; Frank Tobian; Andrea Junge; Victor M. Corman; Terry C.

68,SARS-CoV2- infection as a trigger of humoral response against apolipoprotein A-1,"AimsUnravelling autoimmune targets triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide crucial insights in the physiopathology of the disease and foster the development of potential therapeutic candidate targets and prognostic tools. We want to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 exposure could trigger a humoral response against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgG) through molecular mimicry and assess its relationship to patient prognosis.

Methods and ResultsAnti-Spike domain 1 (SD1) IgGs, anti-apoA-1 IgGs and against mimic peptides, as well as cytokines were assessed by immunoassays on a case-control (n=101), an intensive care unit (ICU; n=126) with a 28-days follow-up, and a general population cohort (n=663) with available samples in the pre and post-pandemic period. Linear sequence homologies and antibodies cross-reactivity between apoA-1, TLR2, and Spike epitopes were identified. Overall, anti-apoA-1 IgG levels were higher in COVID-19 patients or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals than in healthy donors or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals (p<0.0001). Significant and similar associations were noted between anti-apoA-1, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, cytokines, and lipid profile. In ICU patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-apoA-1 seroconversion rates displayed similar 7-days kinetics, reaching 82% for anti-apoA-1 seropositivity. C-statistics (CS) indicated that anti-Spike/TLR2 mimic-peptide IgGs displayed a significant prognostic accuracy for overall mortality at 28 days (CS: 0.64; p=0.02). In the general population, SARS-CoV-2 exposure increased baseline anti-apoA-1 IgG levels.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 induces a marked humoral response against the major protein of high-density lipoproteins. As a correlate of poorer prognosis in other clinical settings, such autoimmunity signatures may relate to long-term COVID-19 prognosis assessment and warrant further scrutiny in the current COVID-19 pandemic.",Sabrina Pagano; Sabine Yerly; Benjamin Meyer; Catherine Juillard; Noemie Suh; Christophe LeTerrier; Jean-Pierre Daguer; Lluc Farrera Soler; Sofia Barluenga; Giovanni Piumatti; Oliver Hartley; Barbara Lemaitre; Christiane Sigrid Eberhardt; Claire-Anne Siegrist; Isabella Eckerle; Silvia Stringhini; Idris Guessous; Laurent Kaiser; Jerome Pugin; Nicolas Winssinger; Nicolas Vuilleumier,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251298,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251298,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

70,Treatment of irritant contact dermatitis in healthcare settings during the COVID19 pandemic: The emollient Dermol 500 exhibits virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2.,"ObjectivesTo investigate whether the antimicrobial emollient Dermol 500 and its active components, benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorohexidine dihydrochloride (CD), exhibit virucidal activity thus informing whether Dermol 500 is a suitable soap substitute for use during the COVID19 pandemic, to combat the increased incidence of work-related contact dermatitis in clinical settings that we report here.

MethodsInactivation of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 by Dermol 500 and the independent and combined virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD was assessed by influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays. Viruses were treated with concentrations of BAK and CD comparable to Dermol 500, and lower, and infectivity of the viruses assessed by titration.

ResultsDermol 500 exhibits comparable virucidal activity to alcohol-based sanitisers against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD exhibit independent and synergistic virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID19.

ConclusionsThe synergistic virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD makes Dermol 500 suitable as a soap substitute to treat and prevent work-related contact dermatitis in healthcare settings.

In this study, we analyzed 460,814 saliva samples collected from July 2020 to January 2021 for a SARS-CoV-2-specific gene target using the FDA EUA test, CRL Rapid Response, based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We measured SARS-CoV-2 viral loads using cycle threshold (Ct) values. A total of 17,813 samples tested positive for COVID-19 using self-collected saliva samples. The Ct values ranged from 11 to 40, 91.3% distributed between 22 to 38 Ct. We then compared Ct values for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases for all positive saliva samples. A total of 8,706 cases were symptomatic with an average Ct value of 29.24, and 9,107 cases were asymptomatic with an average Ct value of 30.99.

72,A surrogate virus neutralization test to quantify antibody-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in finger stick dried blood spot samples,"BackgroundThe spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host cells, and neutralizing antibodies are effective at blocking this interaction to prevent infection. Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample.

MethodsSamples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV).

ResultsDilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991. Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability. Median % neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples.

ConclusionsLarge-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations.",Amelia Sancilio; Richard D'Aquila; ELIZABETH MCNALLY; Matt Velez; Michael Ison; Alexis R.

73,Ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection using exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose in a public health setting,"BackgroundRapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is crucial for taking timely measures and minimizing the risk of further SARS-CoV-2 spread. We aimed to assess the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) for the discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis was a prospective real-world study of individuals presenting to public test facility for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular amplification tests (TMA or RT-PCR). After sampling of a combined throat/nasopharyngeal swab, breath profiles were obtained using a cloud-connected eNose. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and ROC analysis. Data from the training set were tested in a validation, a replication and an asymptomatic set.

FindingsFor the analysis 4510 individuals were available. In the training set (35 individuals with; 869 without SARS-CoV-2), the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.947 (CI:0.928-0.967). These results were confirmed in the validation set (0.957; CI:0.942-0.971, n=904) and externally validated in the replication set (0.937; CI:0.926-0.947, n=1948) and the asymptomatic set (0.909; CI:0.879-0.938, n=754). Selecting a cut-off value of 0.30 in the training set resulted in a sensitivity/specificity of 100/78, >99/84, 98/82% in the validation, replication and asymptomatic set, respectively.

InterpretationeNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities and can be used as a screening test to define who needs an additional confirmation test.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSElectronic nose technology is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and infections.

As of Feb 13, 2021, our search of PubMed using keywords ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""eNose"" OR ""electronic nose"" OR ""exhaled breath analysis"" yielded 4 articles (1-4) that have assessed test characteristics of electronic nose to diagnose COVID-19. In these small studies the obtained signals using sensor-based technologies, two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry, provided adequate discrimination between patients with and without COVID-19.

Added value of this studyWe prospectively studied the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) to diagnose or rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with and without symptoms presenting to a public test facility. In the training set with 904 individuals, the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.948. In three independent validation cohorts of 3606 individuals in total, eNose was able to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in 70-75% of individuals, with a sensitivity ranging between 98-100%, and a specificity between 78-84%. No association was found between cycle thresholds values, as semi-quantitative measure of viral load, and eNose variables.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe available findings, including those from our study, support the use of eNose technology to distinguish between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy. Exhaled breath analysis by eNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities. The results can be made available within seconds and can therefore be used as screening instrument. The eNose can reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminating the need for additional time-consuming, stressful, and expensive diagnostic tests in the majority of individuals.",Rianne de Vries; Rene M.

74,Reinfection Rates among Patients who Previously Tested Positive for COVID-19: a Retrospective Cohort Study,"ObjectivesTo evaluate reinfection rates and protective effectiveness of prior disease among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in the United States.

DesignRetrospective cohort study

SettingOne multi-hospital health system in Ohio and Florida

ParticipantsAll 150,325 patients who were tested for COVID-19 infection via PCR from March 12, 2020 to August 30, 2020. Testing performed up to January 7, 2021 in these patients was included for analysis. Healthcare workers were excluded.

Main outcome measuresThe main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection [&ge;] 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protective effectiveness of prior infection.

ResultsOf 150,325 patients tested for COVID-19 prior to August 30, 8,845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141,480 (94.1%) tested negative. 974 (11%) of the positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 56 had possible reinfection. Of those, 26 (46.4 %) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 4,163 (12.9%) were subsequently positive and 2,460 of those (59.1%) were symptomatic. Protective effectiveness of prior infection was 78.5% (95% confidence interval 72.0 to 83.5), and against symptomatic infection was 83.1% (95% confidence interval 75.1 to 88.5). Protective effectiveness increased over time.

ConclusionsPrior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. Protective effectiveness increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection. As vaccine supply is a limited resource around the world, patients with known history of COVID-19 could delay early vaccination to allow for the most vulnerable to access the vaccine and slow transmission.",Megan M Sheehan; Anita J Reddy; Michael B Rothberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251715,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251715,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

76,Biological attributes of age and gender variations in Indian COVID-19 cases: A retrospective data analysis,"BackgroundThe associated risk factors, co-morbid conditions and biological variations varying with gender and age might be the cause of higher COVID-19 infection and deaths among males and older persons. The objective of this study was to predict and specify the biological attributes of variation in age and gender-based on COVID-19 status (deceased/recovered).

MethodsIn this retrospective study, the data was extracted from a recognised web-based portal. A total of 112,860 patients record was filtered out and an additional 9,131 records were separately analyzed to examine age and gender relationship with patients COVID-19 status (recovered/deceased). Chi-square, t-test, binary logistic regression, and longitudinal regression analysis were conducted.

ResultsThe male COVID-19 cases (65.39%) were more than females (34.61%) and mean age of infected and recovered patients was 39.47{+/-}17.59 years and 36.85{+/-}18.51 years respectively. The odds for infection was significantly higher among females for lower age categories, which declines with age. The age-adjusted odds for recovery were significantly higher among females (O.R.=1.779) and odds for recovery was highest in 5-17 years age category (O.R.=88.286) independent of gender.

ConclusionThe chances of being COVID-19 infected was higher for females of lower age categories (<35 years) which decreases with age. The odds for recovery among females was significantly higher than males. The chances of recovery declines with increasing age and the variation could be attributed to the biological differences between age categories and gender.",Savitesh Kushwaha; Poonam Khanna; Vineeth Rajagopal; Tanvi Kiran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251681,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251681,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

78,Learning Where to Look for COVID-19 Growth: Multivariate Analysis of COVID-19 Cases Over Time using Explainable Convolution-LSTM,"Determinant factors which contribute to the prediction should take into account multivariate analysis for capturing coarse-to-fine contextual information. From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers, During summer, UV can inactivate viruses that live in the air and on the surface of the objects especially at noon in tropical or subtropical countries. However, it may not be significant in closed spaces like workspace and areas with the intensive human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas. Different COVID-19 pandemic growth patterns in northern subtropical, southern subtropical and tropical countries occur over time. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis via visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases.

We have developed a software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using this tool, we detected an emerging lineage of viral isolates in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V.

80,"HaVoC, a bioinformatic pipeline for reference-based consensus assembly and lineage assignment for SARS-CoV-2 sequences","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 related research has increased in importance worldwide since December 2019. Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7, the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2, each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately.

ResultsDue to the lack of publicly available pipelines, which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern, we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HaVoC (Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants Of Concern). HaVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

ConclusionsHaVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks. HaVoC is currently being used in Finland for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Teas and drinks containing extracts of Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra have been widely used in Africa in efforts to prevent and fight COVID-19 infections. We sought to study the ability of different A. annua and A. afra extracts and the Covid-Organics drink produced in Madagascar to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and feline coronavirus (FCoV) replication in vitro. Several extracts as well as Covid-Organics inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV replication at concentrations that did not affect cell viability. It remains unclear whether peak plasma concentrations in humans can reach levels needed to inhibit viral replication following consumption of teas or Covid-Organics.

82,Direct activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is blocked by Simvastatin,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved with endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-{kappa}B and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not affect endothelial activation. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.",Yisong Qian; Tianhua Lei; Parth Patel; Chi Lee; Paula Monaghan-Nichols; Hong-Bo Xin; Jianming Qiu; Mingui Fu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431174,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431174,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False

UV light disinfection is a well-established method for inactivating respiratory viruses. Here, we have determined that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on multiple surfaces. For hard, non-porous surfaces we observed that SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated to undetectable levels on plastic and glass with a UV dose of 34.9 mJ/cm2 and stainless steel with a dose of 52.5 mJ/cm2. We also observed that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirator material to undetectable levels with a dose of 103 mJ/cm2. We included UV dosimeter cards that provide a colorimetric readout of UV dose and demonstrated their utility as a means to confirm desired levels of exposure were reached.

84,Jumper Enables Discontinuous Transcript Assembly in Coronaviruses,"Genes in SARS-CoV-2 and, more generally, in viruses in the order of Nidovirales are expressed by a process of discontinuous transcription mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This process is distinct from alternative splicing in eukaryotes, rendering current transcript assembly methods unsuitable to Nidovirales sequencing samples. Here, we introduce the DO_SCPLOWISCONTINUOUSC_SCPLOW TO_SCPLOWRANSCRIPTC_SCPLOW AO_SCPLOWSSEMBLYC_SCPLOW problem of finding transcripts [Formula] and their abundances c given an alignment [Formula] under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. Underpinning our approach is the concept of a segment graph, a directed acyclic graph that, distinct from the splice graph used to characterize alternative splicing, has a unique Hamiltonian path. We provide a compact characterization of solutions as subsets of non-overlapping edges in this graph, enabling the formulation of an efficient mixed integer linear program. We show using simulations that our method, JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW, drastically outperforms existing methods for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 samples, we find that JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW not only identifies canonical transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts expression of non-canonical transcripts that are well supported by direct evidence from long-read data, presence in multiple, independent samples or a conserved core sequence. JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes.

85,SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein enhances the infectivity of lentiviral spike particles,"The establishment of SARS CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral (LV) systems has enabled the rapid identification of entry inhibitors and neutralizing agents, alongside allowing for the study of this emerging pathogen in BSL-2 level facilities. While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that this augmentation by N renders LV spike particles less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Biochemical analysis revealed that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is achieved without a concomitant increase in sensitivity towards RBD binding-based neutralization.

86,SARS-CoV2 envelop proteins reshape the serological responses of COVID-19 patients,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has elicited a unique international mobilization of the scientific community to better understand this coronavirus and its associated disease and to develop efficient tools to combat infection. Similar to other coronavirae, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host cell complex secretory machinery to produce properly folded viral proteins that will compose the nascent virions; including Spike, Envelope and Membrane proteins, the most exposed membrane viral proteins to the host immune system. Antibody response is part of the anti-viral immune arsenal that infected patients develop to fight viral particles in the body. Herein, we investigate the immunogenic potential of Spike (S), Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) proteins using a human cell-based system to mimic membrane insertion and N-glycosylation. We show that both S and M proteins elicit the production of specific IgG, IgM and IgA in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Elevated Ig responses were observed in COVID+ patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. Finally, when SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614 and G614 variants were compared, reduced Ig binding was observed with the Spike G614 variant. Altogether, this study underlines the needs for including topological features in envelop proteins to better characterize the serological status of COVID+ patients, points towards an unexpected immune response against the M protein and shows that our assay could represent a powerful tool to test humoral responses against actively evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine effectiveness.",Sophie Martin; Christopher Heslan; Gwenaele Jegou; Leif A.

87,Recent and forecast post-COVID trends in hospital activity in England amongst 0 to 24 year olds: analyses using routine hospital administrative data,"BackgroundIncreasing hospital use in the past decade has placed considerable strain on children and young peoples (CYP) health services in England. Greater integration of healthcare may reduce these increases. We projected CYP healthcare activity out to 2040 and examined the potential impact of integrated care systems on projected activity.

MethodsWe used routine administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)) on emergency department (ED) attendances, emergency admissions and outpatient (OP) attendances for England by age-group for 0-24 year olds from 2007 to 2017. Bayesian projections of future activity used projected population and ethnicity and future child poverty rates. Cause data were used to identify ambulatory-care-sensitive-conditions (ACSC).

FindingsED attendances, emergency admissions and OP attendances increased in all age groups from 2007 to 2017. ED and OP attendances increased 60-80% amongst children under 10 years. ACSC and neonatal causes drove the majority of increases in emergency admissions. Activity was projected to increase by 2040 by 50-145% for ED attendances, 20-125% for OP attendances and 4-58% for total admissions. Scenarios of increasing or decreasing child poverty resulted in small changes to forecast activity. Scenarios in which 50% of ACSC were seen outside hospital in integrated care reduced estimated activity in 2040 by 21.2-25.9% for admissions and 23.5-30.1% for ED attendances across poverty scenarios amongst infants.

InterpretationThe rapid increases in CYP healthcare activity seen in the past decade may continue for the next decade given projected changes in population and child poverty, unless some of the drivers of increased activity are addressed. Contrary to these pessimistic scenarios, our findings suggest that development of integrated care for CYP at scale in England has the potential to dramatically reduce or even reverse these forecast increases

FundingNil funding obtained.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere has been marked increases in hospital use (inpatient, outpatient and emergency department (ED)) by children and young people (CYP). Search of the PubMed database using the search terms: (((((""child""[MeSH Major Topic]) OR (""adolescent""[MeSH Major Topic])) OR (""infant""[MeSH Major Topic]))) AND ((healthcare use[Text Word])) OR (emergency admission[Text Word])) AND (united kingdom[Text Word]). Drivers of increased activity include population growth and sociodemographic factors, help-seeking behaviour, growth in medical knowledge and capability, and by factors within the health system. Additional factors in child health include increased survival of premature neonates and those with congenital conditions and rising parental expectations of modern medicine. Previous studies have shown that ambulatory-care-sensitive-conditions (ACSC) are responsible for much of the increase in CYP emergency activity in England and Scotland.

Added value of this studyThis is the first study to use existing data to project possible future scenarios for CYP healthcare activity out to 2030 and 2040 in any country. Our future scenarios are based upon authoritative projections for population, ethnic diversity and child poverty in England and allow us to estimate the potential impact of integrated care scenarios in which ACSC are treated outside hospital. We show that future projected CYP activity is very high if mitigations such as integrated care are not instituted in England.

Implications of all the available evidenceHealthcare activity has grown dramatically over the last decade in CYP, largely due to ACSC and the consequences of premature delivery. Projections to 2040 suggest that similar increases are likely over the next 2 decades without action to reduce child poverty and implementation of integrated care at scale in the NHS.",Joseph L Ward; Dougal Hargreaves; Marie Rogers; Alison Firth; Steve Turner; Russell M.

88,"Noncommunicable Diseases, Sociodemographic Vulnerability, and the Risk of Mortality in Hospitalized Children and Adolescents with COVID-19 in Brazil: A Syndemic in Play","BackgroundAlthough many studies identify the presence of comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes, few have addressed this issue in children. We aimed to study how these factors have impacted COVID-19 mortality in Brazilian children and adolescents.

MethodsThis is an observational study using publicly available data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We studied 5,857 patients younger than 20 years old, all of them hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models to study mortality, stratifying the analysis by age, region of the country, presence of noncommunicable diseases, ethnicity, and socioeconomic development.

FindingsIndividually, most of the comorbidities included were risk factors. Having more than one comorbidity increased almost tenfold the risk of death (OR 9{middle dot}67 95%CI 6{middle dot}89-13{middle dot}57). Compared to White children, Indigenous, Pardo (mixed), and East Asian had a significantly higher risk of mortality. We also found a regional effect (higher mortality in the North), and a socioeconomic effect (higher mortality among children from less socioeconomically developed municipalities).

InterpretationBesides the impact of comorbidities, we identified ethnic, regional, and socioeconomic effects shaping the mortality of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Brazil. Putting these findings together, we propose that there is a syndemic among COVID-19 and noncommunicable diseases, driven and fostered by large-scale sociodemographic inequalities. Facing COVID-19 in Brazil must also include addressing these structural issues. Our findings also identify risk groups among children that should be prioritized for public health measures, such as vaccination.

89,Associations between movement behaviors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"BackgroundThere is limited evidence about emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in Latin America.

ObjectiveTo assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the pandemic in Chile.

MethodsA cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1-to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the childs emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers.

ResultsIn total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9{+/-}1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were  more affectionate (78.9%),  more restless (65.1%), and  more frustrated (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors.

Analysis of linked data from a UK Closing the Gap Cohort,"Smoking rates are higher for people who use mental health services which contributes substantially to health inequalities. Smoking can lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes, yet it remains unclear whether smoking has changed for people who use mental health services. We examined smoking patterns in a large clinical cohort of people with SMI before and during the pandemic. We found high levels of nicotine dependence and heavier patterns of smoking.

91,Early introductions and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in the United States,"The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, first detected in the United Kingdom, has become a national public health concern in the United States because of its increased transmissibility. Over 500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected since December 2020, but its local establishment and pathways of spread are relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic testing data, we highlight the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US and locations of possible underreporting of B.1.1.7 cases. New York, which receives the most international travel from the UK, is likely one of the key hubs for introductions and domestic spread. Finally, we provide evidence for increased community transmission in several states. Thus, genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.",Tara Alpert; Erica Lasek-Nesselquist; Anderson F.

92,Association of demographic and occupational factors with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake in a multi-ethnic UK healthcare workforce: a rapid real-world analysis,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and adverse outcome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is now available for frontline UK HCWs; however, demographic/occupational associations with vaccine uptake in this cohort are unknown. We sought to establish these associations in a large UK hospital workforce.

MethodsWe conducted cross-sectional surveillance examining vaccine uptake amongst all staff at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. We examined proportions of vaccinated staff stratified by demographic factors, occupation and previous COVID-19 test results (serology/PCR) and used logistic regression to identify predictors of vaccination status after adjustment for confounders.

FindingsWe included 19,044 HCWs; 12,278 (64.5%) had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Compared to White HCWs (70.9% vaccinated), a significantly smaller proportion of ethnic minority HCWs were vaccinated (South Asian 58.5%, Black 36.8% p<0.001 for both). After adjustment, factors found to be negatively associated with vaccine uptake were; younger age, female sex, increasing deprivation and belonging to any non-White ethnic group (Black: aOR0.30, 95%CI 0.26-0.34, South Asian:0.67, 0.62-0.72). Allied health professionals and administrative/executive staff were more likely to be vaccinated than doctors.

InterpretationEthnic minority HCWs and those from more deprived areas as well as those from particular occupational groups are less likely to take up SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. These findings have major implications for the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes, in HCWs and the wider population and should inform the national vaccination programme to prevent the disparities of the pandemic from widening.

93,"Population Age-Ineligible for COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States: Implications for State, County, and Race/Ethnicity Vaccination Targets","BackgroundWe examined the geographic and racial/ethnic distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine age-ineligible population (0-15 years old) in the U.S., and calculated the proportion of the age-eligible population that will need to be vaccinated in a given geo-demographic group in order to achieve either 60% or 75% vaccine coverage for that population as a whole.

MethodsUS Census Bureau population estimates for 2019 were used to calculate the percent vaccine ineligible and related measures for counties, states, and the nation as a whole. Vaccination targets for the 30 largest counties by population were calculated. Study measures were calculated for racial/ethnic populations at the national (n=7) and state (n=6) levels.

ResultsPercent of population ineligible for vaccine varied widely both geographically and by race/ethnicity. State values ranged from 15.8% in Vermont to 25.7% in Utah, while percent ineligible of the major racial/ethnic groups was 16.4% of non-Hispanic whites, 21.6% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and 27.5% of Hispanics. Achievement of total population vaccine coverage of at least 75% will require vaccinating more than 90% of the population aged 16 years and older in 29 out of 30 of the largest counties in the U.S.

ConclusionsThe vaccine-ineligibility of most children for the next 1-2 years, coupled with reported pervasive vaccine hesitancy among adults, especially women and most minorities, means that achievement of adequate levels of vaccine coverage will be very difficult for many vulnerable geographic areas and for several racial/ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanics, Blacks, and American Indians.",Elizabeth B Pathak; Janelle Menard; Rebecca B Garcia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251562,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251562,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
94,Impacts of school closures on physical and mental health of children and young people: a systematic review,"BackgroundThe well-documented links between education and health mean that school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be associated with significant health harms to children and young people (CYP). A systematic review of the evidence is needed to inform policy decisions around school closures and re-openings during the pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook a high-quality systematic review of observational quantitative studies (published or preprint) of the impacts of school closures (for any reason) on the health, wellbeing and educational outcomes of CYP, excluding impacts of closure on transmission of infection (PROSPERO CRD42020181658). We used a machine learning approach for screening articles, with decisions on inclusion and data extraction performed independently by 2 researchers. Quality was assessed for study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken as data did not allow meta-analysis.

Results16,817 records were screened, of which 151 were reviewed in full-text and 72 studies were included from 20 countries. 33% were cohort studies using historical control periods; 19% pre-post studies; and 46% cross-sectional studies which assessed change by comparison with population reference data. 63% were high-quality, 25% medium-quality and 13% low-quality. Cause of closure in all studies was the first COVID-19 pandemic wave with the exception of 5 influenza studies and 1 teacher strike.

27 studies concerning mental health identified considerable impacts across emotional, behavioural and restlessness/inattention problems; 18-60% of CYP scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms. Two studies reported non-significant rises in suicide rates. Self-harm and psychiatric attendances were markedly reduced, indicating a rise in unmet mental health need. Child protection referrals fell 27-39%, with a halving of the expected number of referrals originating in schools.

19 studies concerning health service use showed marked reductions in emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions, with evidence of delayed presentations and potential widening of inequalities in vaccination coverage. Data suggested marked rises in screen-time and social media use and reductions in physical activity however data on sleep and diet were inconclusive. Available data suggested likely higher harms in CYP from more deprived populations.

ConclusionsSchool closures as part of broader social distancing measures are associated with considerable harms to CYP health and wellbeing. Available data are short-term and longer-term harms are likely to be magnified by further school closures. Data are urgently needed on longer-term impacts using strong research designs, particularly amongst vulnerable groups. These findings are important for policy-makers seeking to balance the risks of transmission through school-aged children with the harms of closing schools.",Russell M.

95,The Missing Science: Epidemiological data gaps for COVID-19 policy in the United States,"We report on a scoping study of COVID-19 epidemiological data available for COVID-19 policy and management decisions for U.S. settings. We synthesize current US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates for parameter of infectious transmission, infection severity, and disease burden, and summarize epidemiologic contributions to these parameters published by CDC-affiliated investigators through Oct 30, 2020. Authoritative estimates of most infectious transmission and infection severity parameters exist but rely primarily on data from studies conducted in non-U.S. populations. Estimates of secondary infection risks for household, workplace, school, or other community settings are lacking and estimates of the clinical fraction remain uncertain. The CDC reports multiple disease incidence and prevalence measures at national and state geographies, including some measures disaggregated by age group, race/ethnicity and sex; however, nationally uniform disease burden measures are not available at the sub-state level or for sub-populations defined by exposure setting, limiting opportunities for targeted interventions. CDC-affiliated investigators authored 133 quantitative studies on COVID-19 through Oct 30, 2020; however only 34 employed analytic methods. The remainder were descriptive. Of the 34 analytic studies, eleven reported on risk factors for infection, seven reported on risk factors for severe disease, three on symptomatic infections, three reported secondary infection risks, and four reported on indirect pandemic effects. Gaps remain in the epidemiological data required for an efficient and equitable public health policy response to COVID-19. The existence of these gaps one year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for standardizing data collection and research priorities and protocols in the context of a rapidly emerging infectious disease epidemics.",Rajiv Bhatia; Isabella Sledge; Stefan Baral,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251602,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251602,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
96,'Leading from the front implementation strategies increase the success of influenza vaccination drives among healthcare workers: A reanalysis of Systematic Review evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA),"BackgroundSeasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is widely recommended to protect staff and patients. A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that  substantial heterogeneity remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity.

MethodsWe used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically analyse associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions.

ResultsIn Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of  leading from the front rather than  top-down implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions  dont-go-in-cold with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. Reapplying the  leading from the front theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns.

ConclusionsRegardless of intervention type a  leading from the front approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success. While the results pertain to flu vaccination among HCWs, the components identified here may be relevant to public health campaigns regarding COVID-19 vaccination.",Katy Sutcliffe; Dylan Kneale; James Thomas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251475,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251475,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
97,Evaluating COVID-19 reporting data in the context of testing strategies across 31 LMICs,"0.1. BackgroundCOVID-19 case counts are the predominant measure used to track epidemiological dynamics and inform policy decision-making. Case counts, however, are influenced by testing rates and strategies, which have varied over time and space. A method to consistently interpret COVID-19 case counts in the context of other surveillance data is needed, especially for data-limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

0.2. MethodsWe leverage statistical analyses to detect changes in COVID-19 surveillance data. We apply the pruned exact linear time change detection method for COVID-19 case counts, number of tests, and test positivity rate over time. With this information, we categorize change points as likely driven by epidemiological dynamics or non-epidemiological influences such as noise.

0.3. FindingsHigher rates of epidemiological change detection are more associated with open testing policies than with higher testing rates. The non-pharmaceutical intervention most correlated with epidemiological change is workplace closing. LMICs have the testing capacity to measure prevalence with precision if they use randomized testing. Rwanda stands out as a country with an efficient COVID-19 surveillance system. Sub-national data reveal heterogeneity in epidemiological dynamics and surveillance.

0.4. InterpretationRelying solely on case counts to interpret pandemic dynamics has important limitations. Normalizing counts by testing rate mitigates some of these limitations, and open testing policy is key to efficient surveillance. Our findings can be leveraged by public health officials to strengthen COVID-19 surveillance and support programmatic decision-making.

0.5. FundingThis publication is based on models and data analysis performed by the Institute for Disease Modeling at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched for articles on the current practices, challenges, and proposals for COVID-19 surveillance in LMICs. We used Google Scholar with search terms including ""COVID surveillance."" Existing studies were found to be qualitative, anecdotal, or highly location-specific.

Added value of this studyWe developed a quantitative method that makes use of limited information available from LMICs. Our approach improves interpretation of epidemiological data and enables evaluation of COVID-19 surveillance dynamics across countries.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results demonstrate the importance of open testing for strong surveillance systems, bolstering existing anecdotal evidence. We show strong alignment across LMICs between workplace restrictions and epidemiological changes. We demonstrate the importance of considering sub-national heterogeneity of epidemiological dynamics and surveillance.

98,Identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients using machine learning,"The current COVID-19 public health crisis, caused by SARSCoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has produced a devastating toll both in terms of human life loss and economic disruption. In this paper we present a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying whether a given patient (actually infected or suspected to be infected) is more likely to survive than to die, or vice-versa. We train this algorithm with historical data, including medical history, demographic data, as well as COVID-19-related information. This is extracted from a database of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in Mexico, constituting the official COVID-19 data compiled and made publicly available by the Mexican Federal Government. We demonstrate that the proposed method can detect high-risk patients with high accuracy, in each of four identified treatment stages, thus improving hospital capacity planning and timely treatment. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to provide optimal estimators for hypothesis-testing techniques commonly-used in biological and medical statistics.

99,The global distribution of COVID-19 vaccine: The role of macro-socioeconomics measures,"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has continued to spread globally, many countries have progressed clinical trials and started vaccinations at the end of December 2020. This report aims to analyze the association of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and two macro-socioeconomics measures, including human development index (HDI) and Gross domestic product (GDP), among 25 countries till the first week of February 2021. Our results indicate that a higher GDP per Capita is positively associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine distribution. However, UAE and Israel have more successful vaccine distribution outcomes regardless of their GDP. In addition, the result shows HDI does not have a significant relationship with vaccine distribution.

100,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and symptoms in an Irish Healthcare Worker (HCW) setting: Results of the COVID Antibody Staff Testing (CAST) Study,"ObjectivesThis study examined the natural history, including incidence and prevalence, of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies serially up to 6 months post infection in Irish Healthcare Workers (HCWs) at an academic tertiary maternity hospital, during the first pandemic peak from March to September 2020.

DesignThis single centre observational study profiled SARS-CoV-2 incidence and infection using viral RNA detected using oro/nasopharyngeal swabs accompanied by serological assessment of study participants for the presence of S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participant demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 three gene target 2019-nCoV assay (SeeGene Inc., Rep. of Korea) or the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, USA). Blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance evaluation. Two other testing methods were also used; the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay (EuroImmun) and the Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 75 kit on the Architect i2000SR instrument (Abbott Laboratories).

SettingAcademic Tertiary Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland.

ParticipantsWe invited symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers employed at the Rotunda Maternity Hospital to participate in the CAST study.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe CAST study aimed to examine incidence and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs and to determine the presence and longevity of antibodies in this group. We also sought to examine the clinical utility of the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) and to compare it to the current ""accepted"" gold standard platform in Ireland.

ResultsBy July 2020, 398 molecular tests had been completed on symptomatic staff with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this cohort, 14% (n=54/398) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. The CAST study enrolled 137 HCWs with 86 participants symptomatic at time of swab collection and a further 51 asymptomatic control participants. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 52% (n=45/86) symptomatic study participants and serological positivity was confirmed in 98% (n=44/45) of those participants. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was detected in 4% (n=2/51) of control participants with a seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (n=4/51). We demonstrated that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants have detectable levels of antibodies at 100 days post infection, which persisted in 91% of participants at day 160+. Ongoing symptoms up to six months post infection were present in 50% of study participants with positive PCR and serology results. These data will be important to consider for long-term workforce planning in a healthcare setting, as the ongoing pandemic continues.

101,"Risk Perceptions, Knowledge and Behaviors of General and High-Risk Adult Populations towards COVID-19: A Systematic Scoping Review","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a major crisis for governments and populations around the globe. A large number of studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards the disease. The publics risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors are key factors that play a vital role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Our scoping review aims to map the early evidence on risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors of general and high-risk adult populations towards COVID-19.

MethodsA systematic scoping review was conducted of peer-reviewed articles in five databases (MEDLINE-Ovid, EMBASE-Ovid, PsycINFO-Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL-EBSCO) on studies conducted during the early stage of COVID-19 (January to June, 2020). The gray literature was also searched through Open Grey, Scopus, Wonder, Social Science Research Network, MedRxiv, and websites of major public health organizations. Twenty studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included, appraised and analyzed.

ResultsDuring the early stage of the pandemic, levels of risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 were moderate to high in both general and high-risk adult populations. The perceived severity of the disease was slightly higher than the perceived susceptibility of getting COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19. Adults were knowledgeable about preventive behaviors, including hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing, and avoidance behaviors. Nevertheless, an important knowledge gap regarding the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 was reported in many studies. Our review identified hand-washing and avoiding crowded places as dominant preventive behaviors at the early stage of the pandemic. Staying at home, reducing social contacts, and avoiding public transport were less widespread in general populations than in high-risk adult groups. Being a female, older, and more educated was associated with better knowledge of COVID-19 and appropriate preventive behaviors.

ConclusionThis scoping review offers a first understanding of general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should be undertaken to assess psychological and behavioral responses over time. Research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19.

Contribution to the field statementSince the beginning of the pandemic, a large number of primary studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards COVID-19. Nevertheless, no review has mapped the early evidence on the perceptions, knowledge, and preventive behaviors of adult populations towards the transmission of this new disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scoping review that offers an understanding of the general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors (RPKB) towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also identified sociodemographic factors associated with adults RPKB regarding COVID-19. As the virus does not affect individuals equally, knowing these factors can help to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 in certain population groups by developing targeted communication strategies that will facilitate their engagement in preventive measures. Finally, research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and RPKB towards COVID-19. The existence of a disproportionate number of COVID-19 fatalities within Black populations should signal the possible gaps in RPKB towards COVID-19 in these communities. Additional studies on ethnic health disparities can help public health authorities to introduce targeted actions towards these communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",nathalie clavel; Janine Badr; Lara Gautier; Melanie Lavoie-Tremblay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250257,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250257,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True

This is due to the fast airborne oro-nasal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected individuals. The generation of liquid aerosolized particles occurs when the COVID-19 patients speak, sing, cough, sneeze, or simply breathe. We have developed a novel aerosol barrier mask (ABM) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens. This Aerosol Barrier Mask is designed for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission while transporting patients within hospital facilities. This mask can constrain aerosol and droplet particles and trap them in a biofilter, while the patient is normally breathing and administrated with medical oxygen. The system can be characterized as an oxygen delivery and mitigation mask which has no unfiltered exhaled air dispersion.

MethodsWe performed an analytical cross-sectional observational study. We included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated at the ""Dos de Mayo"" National Hospital. Patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis confirmed by rapid or molecular testing were included. Those with an incomplete, illegible, or missing medical history and/or bacterial or fungal pneumonia were excluded. Data were extracted from medical records. The primary outcomes were mortality and admission to the ICU. The Call Score was calculated for each patient (4 to 13 points) and classified into three risk groups. Summary measures were presented for qualitative and quantitative variables. The area under the model curve and the operational characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated for the best cut-off point.

ResultsThe Call Score reported an area under the curve of 0.59 (IC95%: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43 for predicting death. However, for a cut-off point of 5.5, a sensitivity of 87%and a specificity of 65%were obtained.

104,Outcomes of COVID-19 among Patients with End Stage Renal Disease on Remdesivir,"BACKGROUNDSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread use of remdesivir in adults and children. There is little known information about its outcomes in patients with severe renal dysfunction or end-stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis.

METHODSA retrospective, multicenter study was conducted on patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis that were discharged after treatment for COVID-19 between April 1st and December 31st, 2020. Primary endpoints were the length of stay, mortality, maximum oxygen requirements along with the escalation of care needing mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints included change in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition.

RESULTSA total of 52 charts were reviewed, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. 14 patients received remdesivir, and 14 patients did not receive remdesivir. The majority of patients were caucasian, female, with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The mean age was 65.33 +14.14 years. All the patients in the remdesivir group received dexamethasone as compared to only 30% of patients in the non-remdesivir group. There was no significant difference in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition between the two groups. Approximately 35% of the patients died, 18% required intensive ventilation, and the mean length of stay was 12.21 days.

DISCUSSIONThe study demonstrated no clinically significant difference in length of stay, maximum oxygen requirements, or mortality in COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease in the remdesivir group as compared to the non-remdesivir group. Further studies are needed to study the effects of remdesivir on the renal function and disease course in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 that are not on dialysis.",Vijairam Selvaraj; Muhammad Baig; Kwame Dapaah-Afriyie; Arkadiy Finn; Atin Jindal; George Bayliss,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251527,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251527,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
105,Returning to nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences and needs of re-entering nurses,"AimAssessing the needs and experiences of re-entering nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands, thousands of former nurses have returned to nursing to support healthcare staff. After a period of absence and with little time to prepare, these former nurses re-entered during a challenging, uncertain and rapidly evolving pandemic. Little is known about the experiences and needs of these re-entering nurses.

DesignQualitative study

MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 purposively selected nurses who had re-entered nursing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed via thematic content analysis. This study followed the COREQ guidelines.

ResultsParticipants mentioned that a lack of a clear job description led to unclarity about the kind of tasks that re-entering nurses were expected and allowed to perform. This unclarity was especially notable in the newly established COVID-19 departments. Re-entering nurses mentioned to wish for an easily accessible mentorship structure and an individualised and practical training program. Re-entering nurses felt supported by a positive team dynamic, which was shaped by the sense of urgency and relevance of their work and helped them deal with stressful experiences.

ConclusionThe results indicate that a rapid and safe return to nursing during a pandemic could be facilitated by: a clear description of roles and responsibilities; an individualised assessment determining the competences and knowledge disparities of re-entering nurses; practical training focussing on competencies needed during a pandemic; and a collaborative mentorship structure to guide re-entering nurses.

Relevance to clinical practiceThe rapid recruitment of former nurses to mitigate an acute shortage of qualified nurses could play a vital role during a pandemic. To deploy these nurses effectively, safely and sustainably, it is important to address the needs of these re-entering nurses.

What does this paper contribute towards the wider global clinical community?O_LIThis research showed the need to prepare a flexible individualised training programme which could support re-entering nurses during crisis situations, such as a pandemic.
C_LIO_LIA responsive mentorship structure helps to provide support to re-entering nurses in a dynamic, uncertain and rapidly evolving situation.

106,Evaluation of Facial Protection Against Close-Contact Droplet Transmission,"BackgroundFace shields are used as an alternative to facemasks, but their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. The goal of this study is to compare the performance of face shields, surgical facemasks, and cloth facemasks for mitigation of droplet transmission during close contact conditions.

MethodsA novel test system was developed to simulate droplet transmission during close contact conditions using two breathing headforms (transmitter and receiver) placed 4 feet apart with one producing droplets containing a DNA marker. Sampling coupons were placed throughout the test setup and subsequently analyzed for presence of DNA marker using quantitative PCR.

ResultsAll PPE donned on the transmitter headform provided a significant reduction in transmission of DNA marker to the receiver headform: cloth facemask (78.5%), surgical facemask (89.4%), and face shield (96.1%). All PPE resulted in increased contamination of the eye region of the transmitter headform (9,525.4% average for facemasks and 765.8% for the face shield). Only the face shield increased contamination of the neck region (207.4%), with the cloth facemask and surgical facemask resulting in reductions of 85.9% and 90.2%, respectively.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates face shields can provide similar levels of protection against direct droplet exposure compared to surgical and cloth masks. However, all PPE tested resulted in release of particles that contaminated surfaces. Contamination caused by deflection of the users exhalation prompts concerns for contact transmission via surfaces in exhalation flow path (e.g., face, eyeglasses, etc.).",Thomas B Stephenson; Courtney Cumberland; Geoff Kibble; Christopher Church; Sheila Nogueira-Prewitt; Sebastian MacNamara; Delbert A Harnish; Brian K Heimbuch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251443,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251443,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
107,Risk of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among spectacles wearing population of Northern India,"IntroductionSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Long term use of spectacles may prevent repeated touching and rubbing of the eyes. Aim of the study is to compare the risk of COVID-19 in long term spectacles wearers with the risk in persons not using spectacles.

ObjectivesTo know the association between infection with SARSCoV-2 and wearing of spectacles.

Materials and methodsIn this study, 304 patients of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were selected. Their spectacles wearing behaviour was assessed through a questionnaire. Spectacles wearing behaviour of general population was obtained from older studies (for comparison). Risk of COVID-19 was calculated in long term spectacles wearers as well as in persons not using spectacles. Chi-Square test was used for statistical analysis.

ResultsIn this study, total 58 patients showed the behavior of using spectacles continuously during day time and always on outdoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 was found 0.48 in spectacles wearing population as compared to 1.35 in population not using spectacles. The calculated risk ratio was 0.36. The protective effectiveness of the spectacles was found statistically significant (p-value .00113).

ConclusionThe present study showed that the risk of Covid-19 was about 2-3 times less in spectacles wearing population than the population not wearing those.

108,Deep learning models for COVID-19 chest x-ray classification: Preventing shortcut learning using feature disentanglement,"In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, recent research has proposed creating deep learning based models that use chest radiographs (CXRs) in a variety of clinical tasks to help manage the crisis. However, the size of existing datasets of CXRs from COVID-19+ patients are relatively small, and researchers often pool CXR data from multiple sources, for example, using different x-ray machines in various patient populations under different clinical scenarios. Deep learning models trained on such datasets have been shown to overfit to erroneous features instead of learning pulmonary characteristics - a phenomenon known as shortcut learning. We propose adding feature disentanglement to the training process, forcing the models to identify pulmonary features from the images while penalizing them for learning features that can discriminate between the original datasets that the images come from. We find that models trained in this way indeed have better generalization performance on unseen data; in the best case we found that it improved AUC by 0.13 on held out data. We further find that this outperforms masking out non-lung parts of the CXRs and performing histogram equalization, both of which are recently proposed methods for removing biases in CXR datasets.",Caleb Robinson; Anusua Trivedi; Marian Blazes; Anthony Ortiz; Jocelyn Desbiens; Sunil Gupta; Rahul Dodhia; Pavan K Bhatraju; W.

There is an urgent need for antivirals targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to fight the current COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) represents a promising target for antiviral therapy. The lack of selectivity for some of the reported 3CLpro inhibitors, specifically versus cathepsin L, raises potential safety and efficacy concerns. ALG-097111 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (IC50 = 7 nM) without affecting the activity of human cathepsin L (IC50 > 10 M). When ALG-097111 was dosed in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2, a robust and significant 3.5 log10 (RNA copies/mg) reduction of the viral RNA copies and 3.7 log10 (TCID50/mg) reduction in the infectious virus titers in the lungs was observed. These results provide the first in vivo validation for the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as a promising therapeutic target for selective small molecule inhibitors.",Koen Vandyck; Rana Abdelnabi; Kusum Gupta; Dirk Jochmans; Andreas Jekle; Jerome Deval; Dinah Misner; Dorothée Bardiot; Caroline S.

110,"Potent, Novel SARS-CoV-2 PLpro Inhibitors Block Viral Replication in Monkey and Human Cell Cultures","Antiviral agents blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication are desperately needed to complement vaccination to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors. A high-throughput screen of biased and unbiased libraries gave a low hit rate, identifying only CPI-169 and the positive control, GRL0617, as inhibitors with good potency (IC50 < 10 {micro}M). Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however, without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series, we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design, obtaining several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors were obtained, culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by newly identified ligand interactions with a ""BL2 groove"" that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however, until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity. In this study, we report that novel PLpro inhibitors have excellent antiviral efficacy and potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures. Together, our data provide structural insights into the design of potent PLpro inhibitors and the first validation that non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can block infection of human cells with low micromolar potency.",Zhengnan Shen; Kiira Ratia; Laura Cooper; Deyu Kong; Hyun Lee; Youngjin Kwon; Yangfeng Li; Saad Alqarni; Fei Huang; Oleksii Dubrovskyi; Lijun Rong; Gregory RJ Thatcher; RUI XIONG,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.431008,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.431008,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False
111,Mutation N501Y in RBD of Spike Protein Strengthens the Interaction between COVID-19 and its Receptor ACE2,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world for the past year. Enormous efforts have been taken to understand its mechanism of transmission. It is well established now that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its first step of entry. Being a single-stranded RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving rapidly. Recently, two variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, both with a key mutation N501Y on the RBD, appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand its mechanism, we combined kinetics assay, single-molecule technique, and computational method to compare the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction characterized from all these methodologies, while the other two mutations from B.1.351 contributed to a less effect. Surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence-activated cell scan (FACS) assays found that both RBD mutations are of higher binding affinity to ACE2 than the wild type. In addition, atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force microscopy quantify their strength on living cells, showing a higher binding probability and unbinding force for both mutations. Finally, Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations on the dissociation of RBD-ACE2 complexes revealed the possible structural details for the higher force/interaction. Taking together, we suggested that the stronger interaction from N501Y mutation in RBD should play an essential role in the higher transmission of COVID-19 variants.",Fang Tian; Bei Tong; Liang Sun; Shengchao Shi; Bin Zheng; Zibin Wang; Xianchi Dong; Peng Zheng,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431117,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431117,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False

113,"A Comparative Analysis of COVID-19 Physical Distancing Policies in Botswana, India, Jamaica, Mozambique, Namibia, Ukraine, and the United States","BackgroundUnderstanding the differences in timing and composition of physical distancing policies is important to evaluate the early global response to COVID-19. A physical distancing intensity framework comprising 16 domains was recently published to compare physical distancing approaches between U.S. States. We applied this framework to a diverse set of low and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Botswana, India, Jamaica, Mozambique, Namibia, and Ukraine) to test the appropriateness of this framework in the global context and to compare the policy responses in this set of LMICs and with a sample of U.S. States during the first 100-days of the epidemic.

ResultsAll six of the LMICs in our sample adopted wide ranging physical distancing policies. The highest peak daily physical distancing intensity in each country was: Botswana (4.60); India (4.40); Ukraine (4.40); Namibia (4.20); and Jamaica (3.80). The number of days each country stayed at peak intensity ranged from 12-days (Jamaica) to more than 67-days (Mozambique). We found some key similarities and differences, including substantial differences in whether and how countries expressly required certain groups to stay at home. We also found that the LMICs generally implemented physical distancing policies when there were few confirmed cases and the easing of physical distancing policies did not discernably correlate with change in COVID-19 incidence. The physical distancing responses in the LMIC sample were generally more intense than in a sample of U.S. States, but results vary depending on the U.S. State. For example, California had a peak intensity of 4.29, which would place California below the peak intensity for Botswana, India, and Ukraine but above Mozambique, Namibia and Jamaica. The U.S. State of Georgia had a peak intensity of 3.07, which would place it lower than all of the LMICs in this sample. The peak intensity for the U.S. 12-state average was 3.84, which would place it lower than every LMIC in this sample except Jamaica.

However, causal inference is challenging due to comorbid substance use.

MethodsUsing genome-wide association study data of European ancestry (data from >1.7 million individuals), we performed single-variable and multivariable Mendelian randomization to evaluate relationships between smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, SUDs, and respiratory infections.

ResultsGenetically predicted lifetime smoking was found to be associated with increased risk for hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR)=4.039, 95% CI 2.335-6.985, P-value=5.93x10-7) and very severe hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=3.091, 95% CI, 1.883-5.092, P-value=8.40x10-6). Genetically predicted lifetime smoking was also associated with increased risk pneumoniae (OR=1.589, 95% CI, 1.214-2.078, P-value=7.33x10-4), lower respiratory infections (OR=2.303, 95% CI, 1.713-3.097, P-value=3.40x10-8), and several others. Genetically predicted cannabis use disorder (CUD) was associated with increased bronchitis risk (OR=1.078, 95% CI, 1.020-1.128, P-value=0.007).

Here, over 1400 plasma proteins and 2600 single-cell immune features comprising cell phenotype, basal signaling activity, and signaling responses to inflammatory ligands were assessed in peripheral blood from patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, at the time of diagnosis. Using an integrated computational approach to analyze the combined plasma and single-cell proteomic data, we identified and independently validated a multivariate model classifying COVID-19 severity (multi-class AUCtraining = 0.799, p-value = 4.2e-6; multi-class AUCvalidation = 0.773, p-value = 7.7e-6). Features of this high-dimensional model recapitulated recent COVID-19 related observations of immune perturbations, and revealed novel biological signatures of severity, including the mobilization of elements of the renin-angiotensin system and primary hemostasis, as well as dysregulation of JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and NF-{kappa}B immune signaling networks. These results provide a set of early determinants of COVID-19 severity that may point to therapeutic targets for the prevention of COVID-19 progression.

119,A single-cell atlas of lymphocyte adaptive immune repertoires and transcriptomes reveals age-related differences in convalescent COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 disease outcome is highly dependent on adaptive immunity from T and B lymphocytes, which play a critical role in the control, clearance and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is limited knowledge on the composition of the T and B cell immune receptor repertoires [T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs)] and transcriptomes in convalescent COVID-19 patients of different age groups. Here, we utilize single-cell sequencing (scSeq) of lymphocyte immune repertoires and transcriptomes to quantitatively profile the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients of varying age. We discovered highly expanded T and B cells in multiple patients, with the most expanded clonotypes coming from the effector CD8+ T cell population. Highly expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones show elevated markers of cytotoxicity (CD8: PRF1, GZMH, GNLY; CD4: GZMA), whereas clonally expanded B cells show markers of transition into the plasma cell state and activation across patients. By comparing young and old convalescent COVID-19 patients (mean ages = 31 and 66.8 years, respectively), we found that clonally expanded B cells in young patients were predominantly of the IgA isotype and their BCRs had incurred higher levels of somatic hypermutation than elderly patients.

From there, values steadily increased, in correlation with the cumulative COVID-19 incidence, to reach a mean of 36.7 IU/ml and 93% of lots positive by January 2021. Extrapolating the correlation, IGs could reach an anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of ~400 IU/ml by July 2021.

121,A combination of cross-neutralizing antibodies synergizes to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudovirus infection,"Coronaviruses have caused several epidemics and pandemics including the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have already showed striking effectiveness against COVID-19. Nevertheless, concerns remain about antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-related viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here, we report on crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody CV38-142 in complex with the receptor binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our structural findings provide mechanistic insights into how this antibody can accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38-142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies, in particular COVA1-16, to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Overall, this study provides valuable information for vaccine and therapeutic design to address current and future antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 and to protect against zoonotic coronaviruses.",Hejun Liu; Meng Yuan; Deli Huang; Sandhya Bangaru; Chang-Chun D.

122,Surface-aerosol stability and pathogenicity of diverse MERS-CoV strains from 2012 - 2018,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a coronavirus that infects both humans and dromedary camels and is responsible for an ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory illness in humans in the Middle East. While some mutations found in camel-derived MERS-CoV strains have been characterized, the majority of natural variation found across MERS-CoV isolates remains unstudied. Here we report on the environmental stability, replication kinetics and pathogenicity of several diverse isolates of MERS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 to serve as a basis of comparison with other stability studies. While most of the MERS-CoV isolates exhibited similar stability and pathogenicity in our experiments, the camel derived isolate, C/KSA/13, exhibited reduced surface stability while another camel isolate, C/BF/15, had reduced pathogenicity in a small animal model. These results suggest that while betacoronaviruses may have similar environmental stability profiles, individual variation can influence this phenotype, underscoring the importance of continual, global viral surveillance.",Neeltje van Doremalen; Michael C Letko; Robert Fischer; Trenton Bushmaker; Kwe Claude Yinda; Jonathan Schulz; Stephanie N.

While the pathology is not yet fully understood, hyper-inflammatory response and coagulation disorders leading to congestions of microvessels are considered to be key drivers of the still increasing death toll. Until now, physical changes of blood cells have not been considered to play a role in COVID-19 related vascular occlusion and organ damage. Here we report an evaluation of multiple physical parameters including the mechanical features of five frequent blood cell types, namely erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. More than 4 million blood cells of 17 COVID-19 patients at different levels of severity, 24 volunteers free from infectious or inflammatory diseases, and 14 recovered COVID-19 patients were analyzed.

Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains and examined their sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We established a novel rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become GFP+ after overnight infection. B.1.1.7 was neutralized by 79/83 sera from convalescent patients collected up to 9 months post symptoms, almost similar to D614G. There was a mean 6-fold reduction in titers and even loss of activity against B.1.351 in 40% of convalescent sera after 9 months. Early sera from 19 vaccinated individuals were almost as potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Nasal swabs from vaccine recipients were not neutralizing, except in individuals who were diagnosed COVID-19+ before vaccination.

125,Single-cell sequencing of plasma cells from COVID-19 patients reveals highly expanded clonal lineages produce specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"Isolation and characterization of antibodies in COVID-19 patients has largely focused on memory B cells, however it is the antibody-secreting plasma cells that are directly responsible for the production of serum antibodies, which play a critical role in controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date there is little known about the specificity of plasma cells in COVID-19 patients. This is largely because plasma cells lack surface antibody expression, which complicates their screening. Here, we describe a technology pipeline that integrates single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing and high-throughput mammalian display screening to interrogate the specificity of plasma cells from 16 convalescent COVID-19 patients. Single-cell sequencing allows us to profile antibody repertoire features in these patients and identify highly expanded clonal lineages. Mammalian display screening is employed to reveal that 37 antibodies (out of 132 candidates) derived from expanded plasma cell clonal lineages are specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including antibodies that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) with high affinity and exhibit potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

126,IN VITRO ANTI-VIRAL ACTIVITY OF HEXETIDINE (BACTIDOL) ORAL MOUTHWASH AGAINST HUMAN CORONAVIRUS OC43 ANDINFLUENZA A (H1N1) VIRUS,"Mouthwashes are used to decrease oral cavity microbial load due to their antiseptic properties. Hexetidine is a broad-spectrum antiseptic used for minor infections of mucous membranes, and in particular as a 0.1% mouthwash for local infections and oral hygiene.

This study determined the anti-viral activity of the mouthwash hexetidine (Bactidol(R)), specifically in reducing viral concentration of Human Coronavirus OC43 (HCoV OC43; ATCC(R) VR-1558) and Influenza A virus (IAV H1N1; clinical strain) in Vero 6 and MDCK cell cultures respectively, using in-vitro suspension assay (ASTM E-1052-11) designed to evaluate virucidal property of microbicides like hexetidine.

Study results indicated that hexetidine was able to reduce infectivity of HCoV OC43 and IAV H1N1 at 25%, 50% and 100% concentrations by more than 80% at 15- and 30-seconds exposure times. One hundred percent (100%) concentration of hexetidine was found to be cytotoxic to MDCK cell line used for IAV H1N1 propagation. Hexetidine-treated cell lines achieved >80% survival rate for MDCK and Vero E6 at a contact time of 15 seconds and 30 seconds (which are the approximate times of gargling with hexetidine mouthwash).

127,Virus transmission by ultrasonic scaler and its prevention by antiviral agent,"During an ultrasonic scaler (USS) operation, droplets and aerosol are generated that may contribute to the transmission of viruses contained in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid. The purpose of this research was to develop an experimental model for testing the spread of viruses during USS instrumentation and to examining the prevention of spreading by replacing the coolant with an antiviral agent. In a virus transmission tunnel, USS operation with saline coolant and delivery of a viral suspension to the vicinity of USS tip generated droplets and aerosol containing Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV). Evaluation of droplet transmission was evaluated with adherent 48h cell culture monolayer RK13 cell lines in standard 48-well-plates positioned at a distance from 30 to 55 cm. The aerosol was collected by a cyclone aero-sampler flow of 100l/min. Antiviral activity of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite or electrolyzed water (EOW) was tested by suspension test. The two tested antiviral agents transmission prevention ability was evaluated by repeating the same experiment as with saline coolant. All experiments were repeated twice. With saline coolant, the cytopathic effect on cells was found in cells up to the distance of 45 cm, with the number of infected wells decreasing with distance. Viral particles were detected in only one AS in a very low concentration ([&le;]4.2 TCID50/ml). In suspension test of 0.25% NaOCl and EOW, the TCID50/ml was below detection limit after 5s. With both antiviral agents, no cytopathic effect was found. However, the cytotoxic effect of 0.25% NaOCl was evident up to the distance of 35 cm. By USS activity, EAV could be transmitted by droplets up to a distance of 45 cm. Both antiviral agents could prevent virus droplet transmission. The transmission of EAV by aerosol yielded inconclusive results.",Ales Fidler; Andrej Steyer; Rok Gaspersic,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430630,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430630,2021-02-12,2021-02-12,,False
128,SARS-CoV-2 mutations acquired in mink reduce antibody-mediated neutralization,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to farmed mink was observed in Europe and the US. In the infected animals viral variants arose that harbored mutations in the spike (S) protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and these variants were transmitted back to humans. This raised concerns that mink might become a constant source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with an increased threat to human health and resulted in mass culling of mink. Here, we report that mutations frequently found in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from mink were mostly compatible with efficient entry into human cells and its inhibition by soluble ACE2. In contrast, mutation Y453F reduced neutralization by an antibody with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 therapy and by sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients.

However, their roles in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing coronavirus (CoV) infection are largely unknown. Herein we investigate their functions in human epithelial cells, the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and the first line of host defense. A deficiency in MDA5 (MDA5-/-), RIG-I or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) greatly enhanced viral replication. Expression of the type I/III interferons (IFN) was upregulated following infection in wild-type cells, while this upregulation was severely abolished in MDA5-/- and MAVS-/-, but not in RIG-I-/- cells. Of note, ACE2 expression was ~2.5 fold higher in RIG-I-/- than WT cells.

130,Adjuvanting a subunit SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine to induce protective immunity in non-human primates,"The development of a portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine under clinical development, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain displayed on a two-component protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five different adjuvants combined with RBD-NP including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion used in pandemic influenza vaccines; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum), a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; or Alum, the most widely used adjuvant. All five adjuvants induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses after two consecutive immunizations. Durable nAb responses were evaluated for RBD-NP/AS03 immunization and the live-virus nAb response was durably maintained up to 154 days post-vaccination. AS03, CpG-Alum, AS37 and Alum groups conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The nAb titers were highly correlated with protection against infection. Furthermore, RBD-NP when used in conjunction with AS03 was as potent as the prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen, HexaPro.

The Allen Institute for AI and collaborators announced the availability of a rapidly growing open dataset of publications, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). As the pace of research accelerates, biomedical scientists struggle to stay current. To expedite their investigations, scientists leverage hypothesis generation systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to discover novel implicit connections. We present an automated general purpose hypothesis generation systems AGATHA-C and AGATHA-GP for COVID-19 research. The systems are based on graph-mining and the transformer model. The systems are massively validated using retrospective information rediscovery and proactive analysis involving human-in-the-loop expert analysis. Both systems achieve high-quality predictions across domains (in some domains up to 0.97% ROC AUC) in fast computational time and are released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research. In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

132,Clinical Validation of Automated and Rapid mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test,"Novel SARS coronavirus causing COVID-19 was recognized in late 2019. Diagnostics was quickly ramped up worldwide based on the detection of viral RNA. Based on the scientific knowledge for pre-existing coronaviruses, it was expected that the RNA of this novel coronavirus will be detected at significant rates from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals due to existence of non-infectious RNA. To increase the efficacy of diagnostics, surveillance, screening and pandemic control, rapid methods, such as antigen tests, are needed for decentralized testing and to assess infectiousness. The objectives were to verify analytical sensitivity and specificity, and assess the clinical sensitivity, specificity and usability of a novel automated mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 test based on sophisticated optical laser technology detecting viral structure proteins. Analytical performance was verified using bacterial and viral preparations. Clinical performance of the test was evaluated against qRT-PCR in a retrospective study with nasopharyngeal swab specimens (N=211) collected from symptomatic patients suspected of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections. Sensitivity and specificity of the mariPOC test were 92.3% (12/13) and 100.0% (198/198), respectively. The test's limit of detection was 22 PFU/test and it had no cross-reactions with the tested respiratory microbes. Our study shows that the mariPOC can detect infectious individuals already in 20 minutes while clinical sensitivity close to qRT-PCR is achieved in two hours or less. The test targets conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, making it robust against strain variations.

We identified frequently mutated non-synonymous mutations in 2,15,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences during pre and post-travel-ban periods in 35 countries. We further investigated the mutational profile on a bi-monthly basis and traced the progress over the time. Several new mutations have emerged post-travel-ban and on the rise in specific countries, chief among them being A222V and S477N in Spike, and A220V in Nucleocapsid protein. Consequently, we examined the Spike protein epitopes to inspect whether any of these country-specific mutations overlapped with these epitopes.

An initial formulation of this dynamics leads to infinitely many differential equations. Our model, however, can be reduced to a single first-order one-dimensional differential equation. Using this approach, we provide quantitative solutions for different distributions. In particular, we use GPS data from ~107 cellphones to determine an empirical distribution of the number of individual contacts and use this to infer a possible distribution of susceptibility and infectivity. We quantify the effect of superspreaders on the early growth rate R0 of the infection and on the final epidemic size, the total number of people who are ever infected.

Our previous study using genomic data identified a potential role of calcium and lipid homeostasis in severe COVID-19. This study aimed to identify similar combinations of features (disease signatures) associated with severe disease in a separate patient population with purely clinical and phenotypic data.

The PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform was used to analyze features derived from de-identified health records in the UnitedHealth Group COVID-19 Data Suite. The platform identified and analyzed 836 disease signatures in two cohorts associated with increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Cohort 1 was formed of cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and a set of controls who developed mild symptoms. Cohort 2 included Cohort 1 individuals for whom additional laboratory test data was available.

We found several disease signatures where lower levels of lipids were found co-occurring with lower levels of serum calcium and leukocytes. Many of the low lipid signatures were independent of statin use and 50% of cases with hypocalcemia signatures were reported with vitamin D deficiency. These signatures may be attributed to similar mechanisms linking calcium and lipid signaling where changes in cellular lipid levels during inflammation and infection affect calcium signaling in host cells.

This study and our previous genomics analysis demonstrate that combinatorial analysis can identify disease signatures associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 separately from genomic or clinical data in different populations. Both studies suggest associations between calcium and lipid signalling in severe COVID-19.",Sayoni Das; Matthew Pearson; Krystyna Taylor; Veronique Bouchet; Gert Lykke Møller; Taryn O.

138,Estimating real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in Israel,"The vaccination rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines in Israel has been highly successful compared to all other countries. By the end of January, a third of the population has already been administered at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Efforts to estimate the true real-world effectiveness of the vaccine have been hampered by disease dynamics and social-economic discrepancies. Here, using counts of positive and hospitalized cases of vaccinated individuals, we provide sensitive estimations of the vaccine effectiveness by correcting to daily case incidence. We find high effectiveness of 66-85% in reducing SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and over 90% in reducing severe hospitalizations. As more granular data will be available more it will be possible to extract more exact estimates; however, there is little doubt that the vaccine is highly effective in reducing cases, hospitalizations and deaths.",Dvir Aran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251139,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251139,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True
139,Association of state social distancing restrictions with nursing home COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 outcomes,"The COVID-19 poses a disproportionate threat to nursing home residents. Although recent studies suggested the effectiveness of state social distancing measures in the United States on curbing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among the general population, there is lack of evidence as to how these state orders may have affected nursing home patients or what potential negative health consequences they may have had. In this longitudinal study, we evaluated changes in state strength of social distancing restrictions from June to August of 2020, and their associations with the weekly numbers of new COVID-19 cases, new COVID-19 deaths, and new non-COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes of the US. We found that stronger state social distancing measures were associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes (case and death rates), reduced across-facility disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, but more deaths due to non-COVID-19 reasons among nursing home residents.",Yue Li; Zijing Cheng; Xueya Cai; Yunjiao Mao; Helena Temkin-Greener,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251382,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251382,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True

After adjusting for test performance, seroprevalence was 6.9% for September, 16.9% for October, and 24.0% for November. Of the 37 pregnant women testing SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, only 3 were symptomatic. One symptomatic woman testing SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive had multiple co-morbidities and succumbed to COVID-19 pneumonia. Up to January 31, 2021, 8 women identified as SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive delivered, all without complications. Comparison of test adjusted seroprevalence data with cumulative PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases within the Kingston Metropolitan Area indicated that as many as 44.4 times more people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 than identified with PCR testing.

141,Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay to detect the emerging SARS-CoV-2 N501Y variants,"The real-time detection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is critical to manage patients appropriately, and monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical features. Sequencing is not a feasible comprehensive detection strategy considering the very large number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in our current setting. SARS-CoV-2 variants currently of greatest concern carry the N501Y substitution within the spike receptor binding domain. They have become predominant in England (20I/501Y.V1) and were detected in South Africa (20H/501Y.V2), Brazil and dozens of other countries worldwide. The 20I/501Y.V1 variant has started to spread worldwide including in France. It has been reported as 50-74% more transmissible than preexisting strains, suspected to evade anti-spike antibodies, and it caused a reinfection. We have implemented an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay that specifically detects SARS-CoV-2 N501Y. It was found reliable to detect specifically the N501Y substitution and preliminarily allowed estimating 20I/501Y.V1 variant prevalence to 4% among our current SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since January.",Marielle Bedotto; Pierre-Edouard Fournier; Linda Houhamdi; Philippe Colson; Didier Raoult,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250661,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250661,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True
142,"Hospitalizations, resource use and outcomes of acute pulmonary embolism in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic - Emergence of different phenotypes of thrombotic disease?","BackgroundThere is discussion evolving around the emergence of different phenotypes of Covid-19-associated thromboembolic disease, i.e. acute pulmonary embolism vs pulmonary thrombosis and different phenotypes of in situ thrombosis. With this study, we wish to provide hospitalization, treatment and in-hospital outcome data for pulmonary embolism during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and a corresponding 2016 - 2019 control period.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of claims data of Helios hospitals in Germany. Consecutive cases with a hospital admission between January 1 and December 15, 2020 and pulmonary embolism as primary discharge diagnosis were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2016 - 2019.

ResultsAs previously reported for other emergent medical conditions, there was a hospitalization deficit coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave. Beginning with the 12-week interval May 6 - July 28, there was a stable surplus of hospital admissions in 2020. During this surplus period (May 6 - December 15, 2020), there were 2,449 hospitalizations including 45 PCR-confirmed Covid-19 cases (1.8%) as opposed to 8,717 in 2016 - 2019 (IRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.18, P<0.01). When excluding Covid-19 cases IRR was 1.10 (95% CI 1.05 - 1.15, P<0.01). While overall comorbidities expressed as weighted AHRQ Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (14.1 {+/-} 10.1 vs. 13.9 {+/-}10.3, P=0.28), the presence of thrombosis (46.1 vs 45.4%, P=0.55) and surgery (3.8 vs. 4.3%, P=0.33) were comparable, coagulopathy (3.3 vs 4.5%, P=0.01) and metastatic cancer (3.0 vs 4.0%, P=0.03) as contributing factors were less frequently observed during the 2020 surplus. Interventional treatments (thrombolytic therapy, thrombectomy or inferior vena cava filter placement) were less frequently used (4.7 vs 6.6%, OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 - 0.89, P< 0.01). Similarly, intensive care (35.1 vs 38.8%, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 - 0.92, P< 0.01) and mechanical ventilation utilization (7.2 vs 8.1%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.04, P=0.14) as well as in-hospital-mortality rates (7.8 vs 9.8%, OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 - 0.90, P< 0.01) were lower in 2020 compared with 2016 - 2019. This was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (6.4 {+/-}5.4 vs. 7.2 {+/-}5.7 days, P< 0.01) during the 2020 surplus period.

ConclusionsOnly a minority of cases were associated with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 but this does not rule out preceding or undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

143,Hospitalizations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic - Insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network,"BackgroundWhile there are numerous reports that describe emergency care during the early Covid-19 pandemic, there is scarcity of data for later stages. This study analyzes hospitalization rates for 37 emergency-sensitive conditions in the largest German-wide hospital network during different pandemic phases.

MethodsUsing claims data of 80 hospitals, consecutive cases between January 1 and November 17, 2020 were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period in 2019. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) comparing the both periods were calculated using Poisson regression to model the number of hospitalizations per day.

ResultsThere was a hospitalization deficit between March 12 and June 13, 2020 (coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave) with 32,807 hospitalizations as opposed to 39,379 in 2019 (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 - 0.85, P<0.01). During the following period (June 14 to November 17, 2020, including the start of 2nd wave), hospitalizations were reduced from 63,799 in 2019 to 59,910 in 2020, but this reduction was not that pronounced (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 - 0.95, P<0.01). There was an increase in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism after the 1st wave during which hospitalizations had been reduced for those conditions. In contrast, hospitalizations for sepsis, pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary disease, and intracranial injuries were reduced during the entire pandemic.

ConclusionsThere was an overall reduction of hospitalizations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic with heterogeneous effects on different disease categories. The increase of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism is an alarming signal that requires attention and further studies.

144,Data-driven analysis of COVID-19 reveals specific severity patterns distinct from the temporal immune response,"Key immune signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection may associate with either adverse immune reactions (severity) or simply an ongoing anti-viral response (temporality); how immune signatures contribute to severe manifestations and/or temporal progression of disease and whether longer disease duration correlates with severity remain unknown. Patient blood was comprehensively immunophenotyped via mass cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays, leading to the identification of 327 basic subsets that were further stratified into more than 5000 immunotypes and correlated with 28 plasma cytokines. Low-density neutrophil abundance was closely correlated with hepatocyte growth factor levels, which in turn correlated with disease severity. Deep analysis also revealed additional players, namely conventional type 2 dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, plasmablasts and CD16+ monocytes, that can influence COVID-19 severity independent of temporal progression.

Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.248 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of UK, South Africa and Brazil variant into human cells is susceptible to blockade by entry inhibitors. In contrast, entry of the South Africa and Brazil variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment and was less efficiently inhibited by serum/plasma from convalescent or BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals.

Median CRP was 143 [IQR 107-205] mg/L and 3385 (82%) patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids at randomisation. Overall, 596 (29%) of the 2022 patients allocated tocilizumab and 694 (33%) of the 2094 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.96; p=0.007). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients, including those receiving systemic corticosteroids. Patients allocated to tocilizumab were more likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (54% vs. 47%; rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.12-1.34; p<0.0001). Among those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, patients allocated tocilizumab were less likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (33% vs. 38%; risk ratio 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-0.93; p=0.0005).

147,Novel SARS-CoV-2 spike variant identified through viral genome sequencing of the pediatric Washington D.C. COVID-19 outbreak,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has emerged as a global pandemic, severely impacting everyday life. Significant resources have been dedicated towards profiling the viral genome in the adult population. We present an analysis of viral genomes acquired from pediatric patients presenting to Childrens National Hospital in Washington D.C, including 24 with primary SARS CoV2 infection and 3 with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) undergoing treatment at our facility. Viral genome analysis using next generation sequencing indicated that approximately 81% of the analyzed strains were of the GH clade, 7% of the cases belonged to the GR clade, and 12% of the cases belonged to S, V, or G clades. One sample, acquired from a neonatal patient, presented with the highest viral RNA load of all patients evaluated at our center. Viral sequencing of this sample identified a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant, S:N679S. Analysis of data deposited in the GISAID global database of viral sequences shows the S:N679S variant is present in eight other sequenced samples within the US mid-Atlantic region. The similarity of the regional sequences suggests transmission and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant within the Capitol region, raising the importance of increasing the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.

IMPORTANCEA variant in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was identified in a febrile neonate who was hospitalized with COVID-19. This patient exhibited the highest viral RNA load of any COVID-19 patient tested at our center. Viral sequencing identified a spike protein variant, S:N679S, which is proximal to the cleavage site at residue 681. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike is a protein trimer (three subunits) which serves as the key target for antibody therapies and vaccine development. Study of viral sequences from the GISAID database revealed eight related sequences from the US mid-Atlantic region. The identification of this variant in a very young patient, its critical location in the spike polyprotein, and the evidence that it has been detected in other patients in our region underscores the need for increased viral sequencing to monitor variant prevalence and emergence, which may have a direct impact on recommended public health measures and vaccination strategies.",Jonathan Edward LoTempio Jr.; Erik Antonio Billings; Kyah Draper; Christal Ralph; Madhi Moshgriz; Nhat Duong; Jennifer Dien Bard; Xiaowu Gai; David Wessel; Roberta L DeBiasi; Joseph M Campos; Eric Vilain; Meghan Delaney; Drew G Michael,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251344,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251344,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
148,"Expression of ACE2 receptor, soluble ACE2, Angiotensin I, Angiotensin II and Angiotensin (1-7), is modulated in COVID-19 patients.","Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a pulmonary-tropic virus, it is nonetheless responsible for multi-organ failure in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, particularly those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Infection requires virus binding to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) monocarboxypeptidase, a regulator of blood pressure homeostasis through its ability to catalyze the proteolysis of Angiotensin II (AngII) into Ang(1-7). Although assumed, it had not been proven so far whether the SARS-CoV-2 replication in COVID-19 patients could modulate the expression of the ACE2 receptor and/or the AngII plasma levels. We demonstrate here, that in COVID-19 patients the ACE2 mRNA expression is markedly reduced in circulating blood cells. This ACE2 gene dysregulation mainly affects the monocytes which also show a lower expression of membrane ACE2 protein. Moreover, a significant decrease in soluble ACE2 plasma levels is observed in COVID-19 patients, whereas the concentration of sACE2 returns to normal levels in patients recovered from COVID-19. In the plasma of COVID-19 patients, we also found an increase in AngI and AngII. On the other hand, the plasma levels of Ang(1-7) remains almost stable in COVID-19 patients. Despite the Ang(1-7) presence in the plasma of COVID-19 patients it seems insufficient to prevent the effects of massive AngII accumulation. These are the first direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 may affect the expression of blood pressure regulators with possible harmful consequences on COVID-19 outcome.",Ikram Omar OSMAN; Clea Menelotte Jr.; Philippe Brouqui; Matthieu MILLION; Jean-christophe LAGIER; Phillipe PAROLA; Andreas STEIN; Bernard LA SCOLA; Line MEDDEB; Jean-Louis MEGE; Didier RAOULT; Christian Albert DEVAUX,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251001,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251001,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True

We conducted temporal genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the Bronx from March-October 2020. Although the local structure of SARS-CoV-2 lineages mirrored those of New York City and New York State, temporal sampling revealed a dynamic and changing landscape of SARS- CoV-2 genomic diversity. Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some have become 'endemic' to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late summer/early fall. Geographically resolved genomes enabled us to distinguish between a case of reinfection and a case of persistent infection.

150,Associations of DMT therapies with COVID-19 severity in multiple sclerosis,"Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are a vulnerable group for severe COVID-19, particularly those taking immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS. Methods: Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated. Demographic and clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes, hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression. Results: 657 (28.1%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analysed. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01-2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.48-4.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39; aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89), though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.75,95%CI=1.29-2.38; aOR=2.76,95%CI=1.87-4.07) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55,95%CI=1.49-4.36; aOR=4.32,95%CI=2.27-8.23) but only rituximab with artificial ventilation (aOR=6.15,95%CI=3.09-12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.86,95%CI=1.13-3.07; aOR=2.88,95%CI=1.68-4.92) and ICU admission (aOR=2.13,95%CI=0.85-5.35; aOR=3.23,95%CI=1.17-8.91), but only rituximab with ventilation (aOR=5.52,95%CI=1.71-17.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Conclusions: Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and requiring artificial ventilation, and ocrelizumab with hospitalisation and ICU admission, suggesting their use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.",Steve Simpson-Yap; Edward De Brouwer; Tomas Kalincik; Nick Rijke; Jan Hillert; Clare Walton; Gilles Edan; YVES Yves MOREAU; Tim Spelman; Lotte Geys; Tina Parciak; Clement Gautrais; Nikola Lazovski; Ashkan Pirmani; Amin Ardeshirdavani; Lars Forsberg; Anna Glaser; Robert McBurney; Hollie Schmidt; Arnfin Bergmann; Stefan Braune; Alexander Stahmann; Rodden Middleton; Amber Salter; Robert J Fox; Anneke van der Walt; Helmut Butzkueven; Raed Al-Roughani; Serkan Ozakbas; Juan I Rojas; Ingrid van der Mei; Nupur Nag; Rumen Ivanov; Guilherme Sciascia do Olival; Alice Estavo Dias; Melinda Magyari; Doralina Guimaraes Brum; Maria Fernanda Mendes; Ricardo Alonso; Richard Nicholas; Johana Bauer; Anibal Chertcoff; Anna Zabalza; Georgina Arrambide; Alexander Fidao; Giancarlo Comi; Liesbet Peeters,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251316,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251316,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
151,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission, vaccination rate and the fate of resistant strains","Vaccines are thought to be the best available solution for controlling the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [1,2]. However, the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains [3-6] may come too rapidly for current vaccine developments to alleviate the health, economic and social consequences of the pandemic [7,8]. To quantify and characterize the risk of such a scenario, we created a SIR-derived model [9,10] with initial stochastic dynamics of the vaccine-resistant strain to study the probability of its emergence and establishment. Using parameters realistically resembling SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we model a wave-like pattern of the pandemic and consider the impact of the rate of vaccination and the strength of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. We found a counterintuitive result that the highest probability for the establishment of the resistant strain comes at a time of reduced non-pharmaceutical intervention measures when most individuals of the population have been vaccinated. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions [7,11,12] throughout the entire vaccination period.",Simon Rella; Yuliya Kulikova; Emmanouil Dermitzakis; Fyodor Kondrashov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251383,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251383,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
152,"Confirmed forecasts for the expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic in the S. Paulo city, Brazil","An epidemiological compartmental model reported on May, 2020 was previously selected to estimate future outcomes to the dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic breakout in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil. A time-dependent incidence weight on the reproductive basic number accounted for the Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). A first series of official published data from March 1st to May 31st, 2020 was used to adjust the model parameters aiming to forecast one year of the COVID-19 evolutionary outbreak. The cohort study was set as a city population-based analysis. The population-based sample, 25,366 during the study period, was the number of confirmed cases on exposed individuals. The analysis was applied to predict the consequences of releasing the NPIs, and indicated the appearance of a second wave starting last quarter of 2020. By January 31st 2021, the number of confirmed cases was predicted to reach 0.49 Million (0.28-0.77), and fatalities would account for 22 thousand (11-32), 5 to 95% CRI. A second series of official data published from June 1st 2020 to January 31st, 2021 confirms all forecasts previously reported for the evolution of infected people and fatalities associated to this epidemic outbreak in the city of S. Paulo. By January 31st 2021, the official number of confirmed cases reached 469,657 (4 % above predicted average of accumulated cases), and fatalities accounted for 17,333 (19% above accumulated average of fatalities).",Sergio Celaschi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251290,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251290,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
153,"Assessment of Post SARS CoV 2 Fatigue among Physicians Working in COVID Designated Hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh","BackgroundFatigue has been observed after a number of infectious disease outbreaks around the world. After the outbreak of SARS CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in 2019, the disease turned into a pandemic very rapidly. Mental health is a key issue associated with such outbreaks. To explore the fatigue level among physicians working in designated public and private hospitals in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study of post-SARS-CoV-2 fatigue.

MethodIn this study 105 physicians who were diagnosed as COVID-19 infected, got treatment, and declared cured at least 6 weeks before the interview date, were recruited as cases and the same number of age and designation matched healthy physicians as control who are working in the same hospital. Case and control were selected in 1:1 ratio from each of the hospitals. The study population was selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria after taking informed written consent. Data collection was done by a semi-structured questionnaire. Diagnosis of COVID--19 infection was done by detection of SARS CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR from reference laboratories in Bangladesh or by HRCT Chest.

ResultAround two-thirds of the physicians were male (67.6% versus 32.4%). Most of them aged less than forty years (80.5%). The cases had a greater number of comorbid conditions than those who were negative. The FSS score (mean) was much higher for cases (36.7 {+/-} 5.3 versus 19.3 {+/-} 3.8) than the control group with a statistically significant difference with no significant gender differentiation. Similarly, around 67.7% of the previously COVID positive physicians represented in the highest FSS score tertile compared to the respondents in the control group had a mean score of less than 3. The difference was also highly significant.

ConclusionPhysicians, who had a previous history of COVID-19 infection had a higher total and mean FSS score, signifying a more severe level of fatigue than the physicians who had never been COVID-19 positive while working in the same hospital irrespective of their age and sex.",A T M Hasibul Hasan; Muhammad Sougatul Islam; Nushrat Khan; Nazmul Hoque Munna; Wahidur Rahman Choton; Mostofa Kamal Arefin; Mohammad Abdullah Az Zubayer Khan; Mohaimen Mansur; Rashedul Hassan; Numera Siddiqui; Muhammad Shamsul Arefin; Nayema Afroje; Md.

154,"Association between COVID-19, mobility and environment in Sao Paulo, Brazil","Background Brazil, the country most impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the southern hemisphere, uses mobility indices to monitor quarantines. In this study, we quantified the associations between residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, meteorology, and daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil Objectives To acquire time-series data to estimate the associations between daily residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, and meteorology, and daily cases and deaths for COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods We applied a semiparametric generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate: 1) the association between residential mobility index and cases and deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), relative humidity, temperature and delayed exposure between 3-21 days and 2) the association between exposure to for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), accounting for relative humidity, temperature and mobility. Results We found an RMI of 45.28% results in 1,212 cases (95% CI: 1,189 to 1,235) and 44 deaths (95% CI: 40 to 47). Reducing mobility 5% would avoid 438 cases and 21 deaths. Also, we found that an increment of 10 g m-3 of PM2.5 risk of 1.140 (95% CI: 1.021 to 1.274) for cases and of 1.086 (95% CI: 1.008 to 1.170 for deaths, while O3 produces a relative risk of 1.075 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.150) for cases and 1.063 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.124) for deaths, respectively. Discussion We compared our results with observations and literature review, finding well agreement. These results implicate that authorities and policymakers can use such mobility indices as tools to support social distance activities and assess their effectiveness in the coming weeks and months. Small increments of air pollution pose a risk of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion Spatial distancing is a determinant factor to control cases and deaths for COVID-19. Small increments of air pollution result in a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

155,"Protocol for rapid implementation of a SARS-CoV-2 sero-survey during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: who, where, how?","Introduction: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating consequences in the US, yet clinical research on its natural history and transmission outside hospitalized settings has faced tangible and intangible challenges due to uncertainty in testing, case ascertainment, and appropriate safety measures. To better understand temporal evolution of COVID-19 related serological and other immune responses during a pandemic, we designed and implemented a baseline cross-sectional study of asymptomatic community volunteers and first responders in metro-Atlanta before the predicted infection peak in 2020. Methods: We recruited healthy community volunteers and first responders for health history, serology, and biobanking. Through an iterative process, we identified one location on our campus and one community location which were accessible, vacant, distant from COVID-19 testing sites, open for social distancing, private for informed consent, and operational for sanitation and ventilation. Research and cleaning supplies were obtained from other researchers and private online vendors due to shortages, and faculty directly participated in consenting and phlebotomy. Results: A total of 369 participants completed the study visits over six full and three half days. Over half of Phase 1 (174/299, 58.2%) and Phase 2 (45/70, 64.3%) self-reported as healthcare workers, and there was a high percentage of participants reporting exposure to known COVID-19 cases (48.2% and 61.4%). Conclusions: Rigorous prospective clinical research with informed consents and is possible during a pandemic. Effective recruitment for moderately large sample size is facilitated by direct faculty involvement, connections with the community, and non-financial support from colleagues and the institution.",Daniel J Smith; Valerie V Mac; Irene Yang; Brittany Butts; Morgan Hecker; J.

This study aimed to longitudinally assess the prevalence of exposure to the virus and social distancing practices in the local population. Methods: A randomized selection of households stratified by region was created. From June 15 to August 7, 2020, a dweller was randomized in each household, answered a questionnaire, and performed a test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The prevalence of positive tests was calculated for each week and adjusted for the test's sensitivity and specificity. Results: The adjusted proportion of positive results increased from 1.4% in the first week (margin of error [ME] 0% to 2.87%) to 13.38% in the eighth week (ME 10.22% to 16.54%). Among the 213 participants that tested positive, 55 (25.82%) were asymptomatic. Only 37 (17.37%) sought medical consultation for any symptom. Among the 77 (36.15%) that were leaving home to work or study, only 18 (23.38%) stopped due to any symptom. The proportion that referred going to bars, restaurants, or making non-essential shopping decreased from 20.56% in the first week to 8.61% during the peak of diagnoses.

There is an urgent need for robust, scalable monitoring tools supporting resource allocation and stratification of high-risk patients. This research aims to develop and validate prediction models, using the UK Biobank to estimate COVID-19 mortality risk in confirmed cases. We developed a random forest classification model using baseline characteristics, pre-existing conditions, symptoms, and vital signs, such that the score could dynamically assess risk of mortality with disease deterioration (AUC: 0.92).

158,Large-scale silane bead-based SARS-CoV-2 testing of a nursing home in Spain identifies a viral reservoir during lockdown period,"Background: Spain is one of the countries most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As in other countries such as UK and USA, nursing homes have been an important human reservoir for the virus and the population with the highest mortality worldwide. The presence of asymptomatic carriers within nursing homes is one of the factors that could provoke new outbreaks during the relaxing of lockdown measures. Methods: We developed a high-throughput protocol for RNA extraction of patient samples based on silane magnetic beads in multi-well plates. The sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility rates were assessed using positive and negative clinical samples from the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Spain. We utilized the protocol to test a pilot cohort of 138 residents and 87 staff from a nursing home in Northern Navarre, Spain. Findings: Our protocol showed high sensitivity (100%), specificity (96.0%) and linear correlation with PCR cycle threshold values obtained with a standard testing kit (R2 = 0.807, p=3E-05). Testing of 225 individuals from the nursing home revealed 63 residents (46%) and 14 staff (16%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 18 of the positive residents (28.6%) were symptomatic at time of testing. During follow-up, six PCR-negative symptomatic residents were retested and resulted positive. One-month mortality among positive residents was higher than in negative residents (15.9% vs 1.3%), regardless of age or comorbidities. Interpretation: Rapid silane bead-based RNA extraction expanded the testing capabilities and COVID-19 patients were promptly identified. Personal and public health measures were enacted to avoid spreading and tighten clinical surveillance. The ability to easily adapt the technical capabilities of academic research centers to large-scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 could provide an invaluable tool for ensuring a safe lifting of lockdown in countries with high numbers of cases.",Nick Weber; Ainhoa Goni-Salaverri; Jose A Rodriguez; Juan Pablo Unfried; Daniel Alameda; Mirian Fernandez-Alonso; Elena Saez; Sheila Maestro-Galilea; Felix Alegre; Francisco Carmona-Torre; Marta Marin-Oto; Cristina Olague; Leticia Odriozola; Mar Navarro-Alonso; Rafael Sanchez-Ostiz; Josepmaria Argemi; Jose Luis del Pozo; DAVID LARA-ASTIASO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251358,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251358,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
159,Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in the Republic of Ireland during waves 1 and 2 of the pandemic,"Abstract: Background: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases can provide insights into viral transmission and genetic diversity at a population level. However, less is known about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including lockdowns, on circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages and variants of concern, the relative contribution of travel to re-emergence of pandemic waves within communities or how different lineages and variants contribute to disease severity. Methods: We have conducted an analysis within a prospective, multicentre observational study of individuals attending four hospitals in the South-East of Ireland with COVID-19. Samples underwent WGS from which lineages and variants were assigned, lineage frequency was plotted over time and phylogenetic analysis was employed to determine the origin of variants detected post-lockdown. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed relationships between viral lineage/variant and COVID-19 disease severity. Results: We analysed 225 genome sequences across two SARS-CoV-2 waves, 134 (59.6%) from wave 1 (March to June) and 91 (40.4%) from wave 2 (July to December), representing 15.2% of COVID-19 admissions to these hospitals during the sampling periods. Four variants (B.1.1.162, B1.1.70, B.1.1.267 and B.1.1) comprised 68% of variants detected during wave 1. Of these variants, only a single B.1.1.70 sequence was detected in wave 2, while the B.1.177 lineage emerged and contributed to 82.3% of lineages detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of wave 2 variants from outside Ireland. We found no consistent association between SARS-CoV-2 lineages and disease severity. Conclusions: These data suggest elimination of common SARS-CoV-2 lineages from hospitalised cases associated with effective NPIs and that importation of new viral variants through travel was a significant contributor to the re-emergence of the pandemic in the second wave in Ireland. Our findings highlight the importance of genomic surveillance in identifying circulating viral genetic diversity and variants of concern and, also, modelling the disease burden of SARS-CoV-2.",Patrick W.G.

161,Estimating the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections reported through diagnostic testing,"The number of positive diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 is a critical metric that is commonly used to assess epidemic severity and the efficacy of current levels of control. However, a proportion of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may never receive a diagnostic test, while many of those who are tested may receive a false negative result. Consequently, cases reported through testing of symptomatic individuals represent only a fraction of the total number of infections, and this proportion is expected to vary depending on changes in natural factors and variability in test-seeking behaviour. Here we combine a number of data sources from England to estimate the proportion of infections that have resulted in a positive diagnosis. Using published estimates of the incubation period distribution and time-dependent test sensitivity, we estimate SARS-CoV-2 incidence from daily reported diagnostic test data. By calibrating this estimate against surveillance data we find that approximately 25\% of infections were consistently reported through diagnostic testing before November 2020. This percentage increased through the final months of 2020, predominantly in regions with a large presence of the the UK variant of concern (VOC), before falling rapidly in the last two weeks of January 2021. These changes are not explained by variation in rates of lateral flow device or PCR testing, but are consistent with there being an increased probability for the VOC that infection will result in an eventual positive diagnosis.",Ewan Colman; Jessica Enright; Gavrila Amadea Puspitarani; Rowland Raymond Kao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251411,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True

Methods: Cohort study (population-based) including 79,083 people >=50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). At study start (01/03/2020) baseline cohort characteristics (demographic, previous comorbidities, chronic medications and vaccinations history) were recorded. Primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed COVID19 incurred in cohort members throughout 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Risk of suffering COVID19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age/sex and previous comorbidities. Results: Across study period, 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID19 cases were observed (mean incidence: 39.5 cases per 100,000 persons-week). In multivariable-analysis, age/years (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02; p=0.050), nursing-home (HR: 20.19; 95% CI: 15.98-25.51; p<0.001), neurological disease (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03-1.77; p=0.029), taking diuretics (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10-1.75; p=0.006), antiplatelet (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05-1.76; p=0.021) and benzodiazepines (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.53; p=0.047) significantly increased risk; while smoking (HR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.41-0.80; p=0.001), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61-1.00; p=0.048), angiotensin II receptor blockers (HR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.51-0.96; p=0.027) and statins (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.96; p=0.025) were associated with reduced risk. Among non-institutionalised persons, cancer, renal and cardiac disease appeared also related to increased risk, whereas influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk. Conclusion: In a setting with relatively low incidence of COVID19 across the first wave of pandemic period, age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID19 among middle-aged/older adults. Conversely, statins, angiotensin-receptor blockers/inhibitors and influenza vaccination were related with decreased risk.

163,Naive human B cells can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through recognition of its receptor binding domain,"Exposure to a pathogen elicits an adaptive immune response aimed to control and eradicate. This initial exposure is imprinted on the immune system, so that a subsequent encounter to the same pathogen or a variant will result in a memory recall response that is often protective. Interrogating the naive B cell repertoire in terms of both abundance and specificity to said pathogen may contribute to an understanding of how to potentially elicit protective responses. Here, we isolated naive B cells across 8 human donors, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Single B cell sorting, and subsequent sequence analysis, showed diverse gene usage and pairing with no apparent restriction on complementarity determining region length in either the heavy or light chains. We show that recombinantly expressed IgGs and Fabs of these germline precursors bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, a subset of these naive antibodies also bind SARS-CoV, an emergent variant (501Y.V2) and a potential pandemic (WIV-1) coronavirus. Furthermore, naive antibodies can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the absence of any somatic hypermutation, suggesting that protective immunity to coronaviruses, more broadly, may be genetically encoded. Future studies aimed at understanding the naive repertoire to other coronaviruses may ultimately reveal shared specificities that could be leveraged to develop pan-coronavirus vaccines aimed at priming encoded germline responses.",Jared Feldman; Julia Bals; Kerri St. Denis; Evan C.

Transduction of non-permissive cell lines with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K, F83Y and H353K mutations, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. hACE2-lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J, IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice lungs indicated type I and III IFN receptor knockout had minimal effect on virus replication. However, RNA-Seq illustrated that they were required for inflammatory responses in C57BL/6J mice, which were similar to those seen in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we illustrate the utility of hACE2 transduction for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. The hACE2-lentivirus system thus has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, in particular allowing access to GM mice, while also offering the inherent advantages of lentiviral transduction such as stable genomic integration.",Daniel J Rawle; Thuy T Le; Troy Dumenil; Kexin Yan; Bing Tang; Cameron Bishop; Andreas Suhrbier,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430547,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430547,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,False

Here, we show how serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in the presence of RDV selected for drug-resistant viral populations. We determined that the E802D mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was sufficient to confer decreased RDV sensitivity without affecting viral fitness. Analysis of more than 200,000 sequences of globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants show no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants. Surprisingly, we also observed changes in the Spike (i.e., H69 E484, N501, H655) corresponding to mutations identified in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants indicating that they can arise in vitro in the absence of immune selection. This study illustrates SARS-CoV-2 genome plasticity and offers new perspectives on surveillance of viral variants.

Despite extensive analyses, there remains an urgent need to delineate immune cell states that contribute to mortality in severe COVID-19. We performed high-dimensional cellular and molecular profiling of blood and respiratory samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients to define immune cell genomic states that are predictive of outcome in severe COVID-19 disease. Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) manifested increased frequencies of inflammatory monocytes and plasmablasts that were also associated with ARDS not due to COVID-19. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq)-based deconvolution of genomic states of peripheral immune cells revealed distinct gene modules that were associated with COVID-19 outcome. Notably, monocytes exhibited bifurcated genomic states, with expression of a cytokine gene module exemplified by CCL4 (MIP-1{beta}) associated with survival and an interferon signaling module associated with death. These gene modules were correlated with higher levels of MIP-1{beta} and CXCL10 levels in plasma, respectively. Monocytes expressing genes reflective of these divergent modules were also detectable in endotracheal aspirates. Machine learning algorithms identified the distinctive monocyte modules as part of a multivariate peripheral immune system state that was predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Follow-up analysis of the monocyte modules on ICU day 5 was consistent with bifurcated states that correlated with distinct inflammatory cytokines. Our data suggests a pivotal role for monocytes and their specific inflammatory genomic states in contributing to mortality in life-threatening COVID-19 disease and may facilitate discovery of new diagnostics and therapeutics.",Anthony R Cillo; Ashwin Somasundaram; Feng Shan; Carly Cardello; Creg J Workman; Georgios D Kitsios; Ayana Ruffin; Sheryl Kunning; Caleb Lampenfeld; Sayali Onkar; Stephanie Grebinowski; Gaurav Deshmukh; Barbara Methe; Chang Liu; Sham Nambulli; Lawrence Andrews; W.

167,SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine induces a strong neutralizing immunity in preclinical studies,"Controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic depends, among other measures, on developing preventive vaccines at an unprecedented pace. Vaccines approved for use and those in development intend to use neutralizing antibodies to block viral sites binding to the hosts cellular receptors. Virus infection is mediated by the spike glycoprotein trimer on the virion surface via its receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody response to this domain is an important outcome of the immunization and correlates well with viral neutralization. Here we show that macromolecular constructs with recombinant RBD conjugated to tetanus toxoid induce a potent immune response in laboratory animals. Some advantages of the immunization with the viral antigen coupled to tetanus toxoid have become evident such as predominant IgG immune response due to affinity maturation and long-term specific B-memory cells. This paper demonstrates that subunit conjugate vaccines can be an alternative for COVID-19, paving the way for other viral conjugate vaccines based on the use of small viral proteins involved in the infection process.",Yuri Valdes-Balbin; Darielys Santana-Mederos; Lauren Quintero; Sonsire Fernandez; Laura Rodriguez; Belinda Sanchez-Ramirez; Rocmira Perez; Claudia Acosta; Yanira Mendez; Manuel G Ricardo; Tays Hernandez; Gretchen Bergado; Franciscary Pi; Annet Valdes; Ubel Ramirez; Reynaldo Oliva; Jean-Pierre Soubal; Raine Garrido; Felix Cardoso; Mario Landys; Mildrey Farinas; Humberto Gonzalez; Juliet Enriquez; Enrique Noa; Anamary Suarez; Cheng Fang; Luis A Espinosa; Yassel Ramos; Luis Javier Gonzalez; Yanet Climent; Gertrudis Rojas; Ernesto Relova-Hernandez; Yanelys Cabrera; Sum Lai Losada; Tammy Boggiano; Eduardo Ojito; Kalet Leon-Monzon; Fabrizio Chiodo; Francoise Paquet; Guangwu Chen; Daniel G Rivera; Dagmar Garcia-Rivera; Vicente Verez-Bencomo,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430146,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430146,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
168,A novel antibody against the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: effects on proteolytic cleavage and ACE2 binding,"SARS-CoV-2 harbors a unique S1/S2 furin cleavage site within its spike protein, which can be cleaved by furin and other proprotein convertases. Proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the S1/S2 boundary facilitates interaction with host ACE2 receptor for cell entry. To address this, high titer antibody was generated against the SARS-CoV-2-specific furin motif. Using a series of innovative ELISA-based assays, this furin site blocking antibody displayed high sensitivity and specificity for the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, and demonstrated effective blockage of both enzyme-mediated cleavage and spike-ACE2 interaction. The results suggest that immunological blocking of the furin cleavage site may afford a suitable approach to stem proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and curtail viral infectivity.",Michael G Spelios; Jeanne M Capanelli; Adam W Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430451,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430451,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
169,Dual RNA-Seq analysis of SARS-CoV-2 correlates specific human transcriptional response pathways directly to viral expression,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has challenged humankinds ability to quickly determine the cascade of health effects caused by a novel infection. Even with the unprecedented speed at which vaccines were developed and introduced into society, identifying therapeutic interventions and drug targets for patients infected with the virus remains important as new strains of the virus may evolve, or future coronaviruses may emerge, that are resistant to current vaccines. The application of transcriptomic RNA sequencing of infected samples may shed new light on the pathways involved in viral mechanisms and host responses. We describe the application of ""dual RNA-seq"" analysis to consider both the host and pathogen transcriptomes simultaneously, to investigate for the first time the co-regulation of human and SARS-CoV-2 genes. Together with differential expression analysis, we describe the tissue specificity of SARS-CoV-2 expression, an inferred lipopolysaccharide response, and co-regulation of CXCLs, SPRRs, S100s with SARS-CoV-2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide response pathways in particular offer promise for future therapeutic research and the prospect of subgrouping patients based on chemokine expression that may help explain the vastly different reactions patients have to infection. Taken together these findings illuminate previously unappreciated SARS-CoV-2 expression signatures, identify new therapeutic considerations, and contribute a pipeline for studying multi-transcriptome systems.",Nathan D Maulding; Spencer Seiler; Alex Pearson; Nicholas Kreusser; Josh Stuart,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430517,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430517,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
170,Exosomes from COVID-19 patients carry tenascin-C and fibrinogen-β in triggering inflammatory signals in distant organ cells,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-{beta} (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-{kappa}B pathway, we examined the status of TNF-, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients.

ImportanceExosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs and promotes pathogenesis. We expect to detect whether other factors are modulated in the presence of COVID-19 exosomes. Our exosomes related proteomic experiments prioritize after initial verification to further examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 associated other pathogenic mechanisms to target for therapeutic modalities.",Subhayan Sur; Mousumi B.

171,Disruption of nuclear architecture as a cause of COVID-19 induced anosmia,"Olfaction relies on a coordinated partnership between odorant flow and neuronal communication. Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters. Our experiments uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which a virus with a very selective tropism can elicit persistent transcriptional changes in cells that evade it, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430314,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430314,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
172,Intranasal type I interferon treatment is beneficial only when administered before clinical signs onset in the SARS-CoV-2 hamster model,"Impaired type I interferons (IFNs) production or signaling have been associated with severe COVID-19, further promoting the evaluation of recombinant type I IFNs as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the Syrian hamster model, we show that intranasal administration of IFN- starting one day pre-infection or one day post-infection limited weight loss and decreased viral lung titers. By contrast, intranasal administration of IFN- starting at the onset of symptoms three days post-infection had no impact on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence that early type I IFN treatments are beneficial, while late interventions are ineffective, although not associated with signs of enhanced disease.

Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points1. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Prior to infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral  replication hubs, with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids (PCCOs) represent a new  assembloid model2 that supports SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in neural tissue, and PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural infection.",Joseph G Gleeson; Lu Wang; David Sievert; Alex E Clark; Hannah Federman; Benjamin D Gastfriend; Eric Shusta; Sean Palecek; Aaron Carlin; Alex E.

174,Poor antigen-specific responses to the second BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals,"The advent of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. Vaccine candidates have demonstrated robust humoral responses and have protected against infection. However, efficacy trials were focused on individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and, as a result, little is known about immune responses induced by these mRNA vaccines in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immune responses in 32 subjects who received two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. In individuals naive to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. These data highlight an important gap in our knowledge and may have major implications for how these vaccines should be used to prevent COVID-19.

175,"The effect of respiratory activity, ventilatory therapy and facemasks on total aerosol emissions","Background Exhaled respirable aerosols (<5 m diameter) present a high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Many guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during ""aerosol generating procedures"" (AGPs) and droplet (>5 m) precautions at other times. However, there is emerging evidence that respiratory activities such as cough and not AGPs are the important source of aerosols. Methods We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 L/min to count and size-fractionate all exhaled particles (0.5-25 m). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during respiratory ""activities"" (quiet breathing, talking, shouting, forced expiratory maneuvers, exercise and coughing) with respiratory ""therapies"" designated as AGPs: high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, respectively. Activities were repeated wearing facemasks. Results Compared to quiet breathing, respiratory activities increased particle counts between 34.6-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2 to 79.1) during talking, to 370.8-fold (95% CI, 162.3 to 847.1) during coughing (p<0.001). During quiet breathing, HFNO at 60 L/min increased counts 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.4) (p=0.03) and NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D at 25/10 cm H2O increased counts by 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.1) and 7.8-fold (95% CI, 4.4 to 13.6) respectively (p<0.001). During activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared to activities alone. Conclusion Talking, exertional breathing and coughing generate substantially more aerosols than the respiratory therapies HFNO and NIPPV which can reduce total emissions.

176,How to decide which COVID-19 patient with myocardial infarction to send to the Cath Lab? - A case series of COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction,"INTRODUCTIONThe Coronavirus pandemic has hit the world with its vast contagiousness, high morbidity, and mortality. Apart from the direct damage to the lung tissue, the corona virus infection is able to predispose patients to thrombotic disease, thus causing cerebral or coronary incidents.

AIMSThe aim of this study was to find a clinical or laboratory parameter, that would help in distinguishing between COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), who have an infarct-related artery (IRA) and therefore, require immediate revascularization, and those, who have no IRA.

METHODSThis was a single-center, observational study of 10 consecutive patients with COVID-19, who were admitted with confirmed MI.

RESULTSIn our study group the mean age was 67.5 {+/-} 8.3 years, half of the patients were female; all of them had arterial hypertension; 8 patients (80%) had dyslipidemy; 4 (40%) had diabetes. 30% of the patients with MI did not have an IRA, and did not require pPCI. Patients with MI and IRA had significantly higher hsTrI values (48.9 {+/-} 43.2 vs 0.6 {+/-} 0.7, p=0.007) and exclusively typical chest pain 100% vs 0%, p=0.007), compared to patients with MI without an IRA. The ECG changes had only marginal statistical significance. Our results suggest that using a higher cut-off value for hsTrI (>7.5 times upper reference range) increases the specificity and positive predictive value for diagnosing a MI with the presence of IRA and need for pPCI, to 100%

177,Multivariate spatio-temporal analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant mortality and disruption on a global scale not seen in living memory. Understanding the spatial and temporal vectors of transmission as well as similarities in the trajectories of recorded cases and deaths across countries can aid in understanding the benefit or otherwise of varying interventions and control strategies on virus transmission. It can also highlight emerging globa trends as they occur. Data on number of cases and deaths across the globe have been made available through a variety of databases and provide a wide range of opportunities for the application of multivariate statistical methods to extract information on similarity or difference from them. Here we conduct spatial and temporal multivariate statistical analyses of global Covid-19 cases and deaths for the period spanning January to August 2020, using a variety of distance based multivariate methods to cluster countries according to similar temporal trends in cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19. We also use novel air passenger data as a proxy for movement between countries. The air passenger movement can act as an important vector of transmission and thus scaling covariance matrices before conducting dimension reduction techniques can account for known structures in the data and help highlight important residual spatial and/or temporal trends that may then be attributable to the success of interventions or other cultural differences. Global temporal structure is found to be of significantly more importance than local spatial structure in terms of global dynamics. Our results highlight a significant global change in case and mortality daynamics from early-August, consistent in timing with the emergence of new strains with highger levels of transmission. We propose the methodology offers great potential in real-time analysis of complex, noisy spatio-temporal data and the extraction of emerging changes in pandemic dynamics that can support policy and decision makers.",Wen Xiang; Ben Swallow,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251339,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251339,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
178,Rapid Impact Analysis of B 1.1.7 Variant on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in North Carolina,"BackgroundSeveral cases of the B1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified in North Carolina first on January 23, 2021 in Mecklenburg County and later in Guilford County on January 28, 2021.[1,2] This variant has been associated with higher levels of transmissibility.[3-6] This study examines the potential impact of increased transmissibility as the B1.1.7 variant becomes more predominant given current vaccine distribution plans and existing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).

MethodWe explored the anticipated impact on the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County given the date of import of B1.1.7. The approximate growth rate in proportion of B1.1.7 observed in the United Kingdom was fit and used to establish the estimate share of B1.1.7 circulating in North Carolina. Using the nowcasted reproduction numbers, a stochastic discrete compartmental model was fit with the current vaccination rates and B1.1.7 transmissibility to estimate the impact on the effective reproduction number.

ResultsWe found that the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County may exceed one, indicating a return to accelerating spread of infection in April as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases. The effective reproduction number will likely decrease into March, then increase as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases in circulation in the population.

ConclusionsExisting non-pharmaceutical interventions will need to remain in effect through the spring. Given the current vaccination rate and these interventions, it is likely that there will be an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The impact of the variant will likely be heterogeneous across North Carolina given the reproduction number and volume of susceptible persons in each county at the time of introduction of the variant. Age-based vaccinations will likely reduce the overall impact on hospitalizations.

179,L18F substrain of SARS-CoV-2 VOC-202012/01 is rapidly spreading in England,"The Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7) is a rapidly growing lineage of SARS-CoV-2. In January 2021, VOC-202012/01 constituted about 80% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England and was present in 27 out of 29 countries that reported at least 50 viral genomes. As this strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. Based on GISAID data we systematically estimated growth rates of mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that L18F substitution in viral spike protein has initiated a substrain characterized by replicative advantage of 1.70 [95% CI: 1.56-1.96] in relation to the remaining VOC-202012/01 substrains. The L18F mutation is of significance because when recently analyzed in the context of the South African strain 501Y.V2 it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. We additionally indicate three mutations that were acquired by VOC-202012/01 in the receptor binding motif of spike, specifically E484K, F490S, and S494P, that may also give rise to escape mutants.

MethodThe cross-sectional web-based research was conducted between mid-November and mid-December 2020 with the objective of understanding the psychological and behavioral consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on students due to the constraint of forced control. The study included a) socio-demographic questions such as age, gender, degree enrolled and any member of the family infected with COVID-19, b) psychometric scales evaluating the psychological and behavioral impact caused by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as fear of the COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), depression by the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, and anxiety by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7).

ResultsTotal number of 324 students participated in this study in which 44.4% were male and 55.6% were female. Fear of COVID-19 scale showed 68.8% of students had high fear among students, 24.4% had moderate to severe depression and 51.5% had moderate to severe anxiety. The correlation between fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19s) and Generalized Anxiety scale (GAD-7) was found to be 0.474 and 0.492 was found between fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19s) scale and brief patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9)

ConclusionThis research concludes that there is a very strong fear of COVID-19 among students, along with anxiety and depression.

DesignThere was retrospective and prospective data collection using standard tools. We determined the prevalence of fever and cough in households. We evaluated household knowledge about COVID-19 prevention and adherence to preventive measures. We evaluated the presence of a workforce, essential infrastructure and equipment needed for COVID-19 case management, and the availability of essential maternal and child health services in health facilities.

SettingSiaya in rural Western Kenya

Participantshouseholds and health facilities in Siaya

ResultsWe visited 19474 households and assessed 152 facilities. The prevalences of fever and cough ranged from 1.4% to 4.3% and 0.2 to 0.8% respectively; 97% and 98% of households had not received a guest from nor travelled outside Siaya respectively; 97% knew about frequent handwashing, 66% knew about keeping distance, and 80% knew about wearing a mask; 63% washed their hands countless times; 53% remained home; and 74% used a mask when out in public. The health facility assessment showed: 93.6% were dispensaries and health centers; 90.4% had nurses; 40.5% had oxygen capacity; 13.5% had pulse oximeters; and 2 ventilators were available; 94.2% of facilities did not have COVID-19 testing kits; 94% and 91% of facilities continued to provide antenatal care and immunization services respectively. Health care worker training in COVID-19 had been planned.

ConclusionsHousehold prevalence of fever and cough was low suggesting Siaya had not entered the active community transmission phase in June 2020. Our assessment revealed a need for training in COVID-19 case management, and a need for basic equipment and supplies including pulse oximeters and oxygen. Future interventions should address these gaps.

183,Galectin-3 as a potential prognostic biomarker of severe COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"BACKGROUNDPrognostic biomarkers are needed to identify patients at high-risk for severe COVID-19. Galectin-3 is known to drive neutrophil infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributing to airway inflammation.

METHODSIn this prospective cohort, we assessed galectin-3 levels in 156 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were diagnosed as either critical (>50% lung damage) or moderate (<50% of lung damage) based on computerized tomography. Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or died during hospitalization were categorized as having a severe outcome, and a non-severe outcome if they were discharged and none of the former occurred.

RESULTSElevated serum galectin-3 was significantly higher in critical patients compared to moderate ones (35.91 {+/-} 19.37 ng/mL vs. 25 {+/-} 14.85 ng/mL, p<0.0001). Patients who progressed to a severe outcome including IMV and/or in-hospital death, presented higher galectin-3 levels (41.17 ng/mL [IQR 29.71 - 52.25] vs. 23.76 ng/mL [IQR 15.78 - 33.97] compared to those of a non-severe outcome, p<0.0001). Galectin-3 discriminated well between those with severe and non-severe outcome, with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 - 0.84, p<0.0001) and was found to be an independent predictor of severe outcome regardless of the percentage of lung involvement. Additionally, the combination of galectin-3, CRP and albumin, significantly improved its individual predicting ability with an AUC 0.84 (95% CI 0.77 - 0.91, p<0.0001).

CONCLUSIONCirculating galectin-3 levels can be used to predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including the requirement of mechanical ventilation and/or death, regardless of the initial severity of the disease.",Eduardo Cervantes-Alvarez; Nathaly Limon-de la Rosa; Moises Salgado-de la Mora; Paola Valdez-Sandoval; Mildred Palacios-Jimenez; Fatima Rodriguez-Alvarez; Brenda I.

184,The protective association between statins use and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionStatins may reduce a cytokine storm, which has been hypothesized as a possible mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage.

MethodsLiteratures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsThirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75). The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88).

185,Current quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may give positive results for other described coronavirus,"Some weeks after the first CoVID-19 outbreak, the WHO published some qPCR protocol assays developed by different institutions worldwide. These qPCR designs are being used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population, which allow us to monitore the prevalence of the virus during the pandemic. Moreover, the use of these designs is wide spreading and nowadays they are used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples to act as epidemiological surveillance tool. However, at the time of designing the published RT-qPCR assays, a lack of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available may explain a low exclusivity in some cases. In this study, we are reporting experimental data which demonstrate that some of the current qPCR used to detect SARS-CoV-2 may give positive results for other described coronavirus different from SARS-CoV-2.",Antonio Martinez-Murcia; Adrian Garcia-Sirera; Aaron Navarro; Patricia Ros-Tarraga; Laura Perez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251332,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251332,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
186,Development and Validation of a Simplified Risk Score for the Prediction of Critical COVID-19 Illness in Newly Diagnosed Patients,"Scores for identifying patients at high risk of progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are discussed as key instruments for clinical decision-making and patient management during the current pandemic.

Here we used the patient data from the multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 - Infected Patients (LEOSS) and applied a technique of variable selection in order to develop a simplified score to identify patients at increased risk of critical illness or death.

A total of 1,946 patients, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the initial analysis. They were split into a derivation and a validation cohort (n=1,297 and 649, respectively). A stability selection among a total of 105 baseline predictors for the combined endpoint of progression to critical phase or COVID-19-related death allowed us to develop a simplified score consisting of five predictors: CRP, Age, clinical disease phase (uncomplicated vs. complicated), serum urea and D-dimer (abbreviated as CAPS-D score). This score showed an AUC of 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) in the validation cohort for predicting the combined endpoint within 7 days of diagnosis and 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) during the full follow-up. Finally, we used an additional prospective cohort of 682 patients, who were diagnosed largely after the ""first wave"" of the pandemic to validate predictive accuracy of the score, observing similar results (AUC for an event within 7 days: 0.83, CI95%, 0.78-0.87; for full follow-up: 0.82, CI95%, 0.78-0.86).

We thus successfully establish and validate an easily applicable score to calculate the risk of disease progression of COVID-19 to critical illness or death.",Stanislas Werfel; Carolin E. M.

187,"COVID-19 infection and outcomes in a population-based cohort of 17,173 adults with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population","ObjectivesTo compare COVID-19 infection, severe infection, mortality, case-fatality, and excess deaths, among adults with intellectual disabilities and those without.

DesignRecord-linkage of all adults recorded with intellectual disabilities in Scotlands Census, 2011, and a 5% sample of other adults, to COVID-19 test results (Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland), hospitalisations (Scottish Morbidity Record 01), and deaths (National Records of Scotland).

SettingGeneral population; 24th January 2020 - 15th August 2020

ParticipantsSuccessful linkage of 94.8% provided data on 17,173 adults with, and 195,859 without, intellectual disabilities.

OutcomesCrude rates of COVID-19 infection, severe infection (hospitalisation/death), mortality, and case fatality; age-, sex- and deprivation-standardised severe infection and mortality ratios; annual all-cause mortality for 2020 and 2015-2019.

ResultsAdults with intellectual disabilities had higher rates of COVID-19 infection (957/100,000 versus 513/100,000); severe infection (549/100,000 versus 237/100,000); mortality (259/100,000 versus 114/100,000); and case-fatality (30% versus 24%). Poorer COVID-19 outcomes remained after standardising for age, sex and deprivation: standardised severe infection ratio 2.59 (95% CI 1.80, 3.39) and mortality ratio 3.20 (95% CI 2.16, 4.25). These were higher among 55-64 year olds: 7.12 (95% CI 3.73, 10.50) and 16.16 (95% CI7.69, 24.63) respectively. Among adults with intellectual disabilities, all-cause mortality was only slightly higher in 2020 than the previous five years: standardised mortality ratios 2.49 (95% CI 2.17, 2.81) and 2.38 (95% CI 2.26, 2.49) respectively.

ConclusionsAdults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to be infected with COVID-19, and had worse outcomes once infected, particularly those under 65 years. Non-pharmaceutical interventions directed at formal and informal carers are essential to reduce transmission and all adults with intellectual disabilities should be immediately prioritised for vaccination regardless of age.

188,Modelling the impact of reopening schools in early 2021 in the presence of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant and with roll-out of vaccination against COVID-19,"BackgroundFollowing the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK in late 2020 and the emergence of the new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, B.1.1.7, a third national lockdown was imposed from January 5, 2021. Following the decline of COVID-19 cases over the remainder of January 2021, it is important to assess the conditions under which reopening schools from early March is likely to lead to resurgence of the epidemic. This study models the impact of a partial national lockdown with social distancing measures enacted in communities and workplaces under different strategies of reopening schools from March 8, 2021 and compares it to the impact of continual full national lockdown remaining until April 19, 2021.

MethodsWe used our previously published model, Covasim, to model the emergence of B.1.1.7 over September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We extended the model to incorporate the impacts of the roll-out of a two-dose vaccine against COVID-19, assuming 200,000 daily doses of the vaccine in people 75 years or older with vaccination that offers 95% reduction in disease acquisition and 10% reduction of transmission blocking. We used the model, calibrated until January 25, 2021, to simulate the impact of a full national lockdown (FNL) with schools closed until April 19, 2021 versus four different partial national lockdown (PNL) scenarios with different elements of schooling open: 1) staggered PNL with primary schools and exam-entry years (years 11 and 13) returning on March 8, 2021 and the rest of the schools years on March 15, 2020; 2) full-return PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021; 3) primary-only PNL with primary schools and exam critical years (Y11 and Y13) going back only on March 8, 2021 with the rest of the secondary schools back on April 19, 2021 and 4) part-Rota PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021 with primary schools remaining open continuously but secondary schools on a two-weekly rota-system with years alternating between a fortnight of face-to-face and remote learning until April 19, 2021. Across all scenarios, we projected the number of new daily cases, cumulative deaths and effective reproduction number R until April 30, 2020.

ResultsOur calibration across different scenarios is consistent with the new variant B.1.1.7 being around 60% more transmissible. Strict social distancing measures, i.e. national lockdowns, are required to contain the spread of the virus and control the hospitalisations and deaths during January and February 2021. The national lockdown will reduce the number of cases by early March levels similar to those seen in October with R also falling and remaining below 1 during the lockdown. Infections start to increase when schools open but if other parts of society remain closed this resurgence is not sufficient to bring R above 1. Reopening primary schools and exam critical years only or having primary schools open continuously with secondary schools on rotas will lead to lower increases in cases and R than if all schools open. Under the current vaccination assumptions and across the set of scenarios considered, R would increase above 1 if society reopens simultaneously, simulated here from April 19, 2021.

FindingsOur findings suggest that stringent measures are necessary to mitigate the increase in cases and bring R below 1 over January and February 2021. It is plausible that a PNL with schools partially open from March 8, 2021 and the rest of the society remaining closed until April 19, 2021 may keep R below 1, with some increase evident in infections compared to continual FNL until April 19, 2021. Reopening society in mid-April, with the vaccination strategy we model, could push R above 1 and induce a surge in infections, but the effect of vaccination may be able to control this in future depending on the transmission blocking properties of the vaccines.",Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Cliff Kerr; Katherine Rosenfeld; Dina Mistry; William Waites; Daniel J Klein; Chris Bonell; Russell M Viner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251287,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251287,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
189,High School Sports During the CoVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact of Sport Participation on the Health of Adolescents,"ContextDuring the fall of 2020, some high schools across the US allowed their students to participate in interscholastic sports while others cancelled or postponed their sport programs due to concerns regarding CoVID19 transmission. It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of student athletes.

ObjectiveIdentify the impact of playing a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic on the health of student athletes.

DesignCross-sectional study.

SettingSample recruited via email.

Patients or Other Participants559 Wisconsin high school athletes (age=15.7+1.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP).

Main Outcome Measure(s)Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch.

RESULTSPLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p<0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p<0.001). PLY athletes reported higher (better) PFABS scores (mean: [95%CI]), (PLY=23.2[22.0,24.5], DNP=16.4[15.0,17.8], p <0.001) and higher (better) PedsQL total scores (PLY=88.4[85.9,90.9], DNP=79.6[76.8,82.4], p <0.001).

CONCLUSIONSAdolescent athletes who played a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as higher physical activity and quality of life scores compared to adolescent athletes who did not play a sport.

190,COVID-19 in pregnancy: characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women admitted to hospital because of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Nordic countries.,"IntroductionPopulation-based studies about the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) in pregnancy are few and have limited generalizability to the Nordic population and health care systems.

Material and methodThis study examines pregnant women with COVID-19 in the five Nordic countries. Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test 14 days or fewer prior to the admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID-19 related.

ResultsIn the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women needed hospital care due to COVID-19. The rate of admission due to COVID-19 was 0.4 per 1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland, and Norway and 3.8 per 1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID-19 were more frequently obese (P < 0.001) and had migrant background (P < 0.001) compared to the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Preterm delivery (n=12, 25%, P < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n=21, 43,8%, P < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID-19 compared to the women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported.

ConclusionsThe risk of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries. National public health policies appear to have had an impact on the rates of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy. Nordic collaboration is important in collecting robust data and assessing rare outcomes.

191,Patterns of COVID-19 pandemic dynamics following deployment of a broad national immunization program,"Studies on the real-life impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine, recently authorized for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are urgently needed. Here, we analysed the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization in Israel following a vaccination campaign initiated on December 20th, 2020. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data originating from the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) from March 2020 to February 2021. In order to distill the possible effect of the vaccinations from other factors, including a third lockdown imposed in Israel on January 2021, we compared the time-dependent changes in number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations between (1) individuals aged 60 years and older, eligible to receive the vaccine earlier and younger individuals (0-59 years old); (2) early-vaccinated cities compared to late-vaccinated cities; (3) early-vaccinated geographical statistical areas (GSAs) compared to late-vaccinated GSAs; and (4) the current lockdown versus the previous lockdown, imposed on September 2020. By February 6th 2021, 45.3% and 29.7% of the entire Israeli population (89.9% and 80% of individuals older than 60 years old) received the first dose or both doses of the vaccine, respectively, or recovered from COVID-19. In mid-January, the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalization started to decline, with a larger and earlier decrease among older individuals. This trend was more evident in early-vaccinated compared to late-vaccinated cities. Such a pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown. Our analysis demonstrates evidence for the real-life effectiveness of a national vaccination campaign in Israel on the pandemic dynamics. This report reflects a snapshot of a fast-changing situation. However, we believe our findings have major public health implications in the struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic, including the publics perception of the need for and benefit of nationwide vaccination campaigns.

192,A potent bispecific nanobody protects hACE2 mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via intranasal administration,"The dramatically expanding COVID-19 needs multiple effective countermeasures. Neutralizing antibodies are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. A number of neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) were reported for their in vitro activities. However, in vivo protection of these nanobodies was not reported in animal models. In the current report, we characterized several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from a screen of an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibited picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and 15 circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs were engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15, a novel trimer constituted of three Nbs, was constructed to be bispecific for human serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited sub-ng/ml neutralization potency against the wild-type and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo. In addition, we showed that intranasal administration of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 provided 100% protection for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection in transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is a potential candidate for both prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory administration.

193,High Throughput Nanopore Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Genomes from Patient Samples,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, causing a potentially lethal respiratory viral infection. By early 2020, the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, had spread globally, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The infection and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 make it amenable to tracking movement and evolution by viral genome sequencing. Efforts to develop effective public health policies, therapeutics, or vaccines to treat or prevent COVID-19 are also expected to benefit from tracking mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we describe a set of comprehensive working protocols, from viral RNA extraction to analysis using online visualization tools, for high throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes using a MinION instrument. This set of protocols should serve as a reliable  how-to reference for generating high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with ARTIC primer sets and next- generation nanopore sequencing technology. In addition, many of the preparation, quality control, and analysis steps will be generally applicable to other sequencing platforms.",Adrian A Pater; Michael S Bosmeny; Mansi Parasrampuria; Seth B Eddington; Katy N Ovington; Christopher L Barkau; Adam A White; Paige E Metz; Rourke J Sylvain; Ramdevi Chilamkurthy; Abadat O Yinusa; Scott W Benzinger; Madison M Hebert; Keith T Gagnon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430478,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430478,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
194,"Transformations, Comparisons, and Analysis of Down to Up Protomer States of Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 Prefusion Spike Protein Including the UK Variant B.1.1.7","Monitoring and strategic response to variants in SARS-CoV-2 represents a considerable challenge in the current pandemic, as well as potentially future viral outbreaks of similar magnitude. In particular mutations and deletions involving the virions prefusion Spike protein has significant potential impact on vaccines and therapeutics that utilize this key structural viral protein in their mitigation strategies. In this study, we have demonstrated how dominant energetic landscape mappings (""glue points"") coupled with sequence alignment information can potentially identify or flag key residue mutations and deletions associated with variants. Surprisingly, we also found excellent homology of stabilizing residue glue points across the lineage of {beta} coronavirus Spike proteins, and we have termed this as ""sequence homologous glue points"". In general, these flagged residue mutations and/or deletions are then computationally studied in detail using all-atom biocomputational molecular dynamics over approximately one microsecond in order to ascertain structural and energetic changes in the Spike protein associated variants. Specifically, we examined both a theoretically-based triple mutant and the so called UK or B.1.1.7 variant. For the theoretical triple mutant, we demonstrated through Alanine mutations, which help ""unglue"" key residue-residue interactions, that these three key stabilizing residues could cause the transition of Down to Up protomer states, where the Up protomer state allows binding of the prefusion Spike protein to hACE2 host cell receptors, whereas the Down state is believed inaccessible. For the B.1.1.7 variant, we demonstrated the critical importance of D614G and N5017 on the structure and binding of the Spike protein associated variant. In particular, we had previously identified D614 as a key glue point in the inter-protomer stabilization of the Spike protein. Other mutations and deletions associated with this variant did not appear to play a pivotal role in structure or binding changes. The mutant D614G is a structure breaking Glycine mutation demonstrating a relatively large hinge angle and highly stable Up conformation in agreement with previous studies. In addition, we demonstrate that the mutation N501Y may significantly increase the Spike protein binding to hACE2 cell receptors through its interaction with Y41 of hACE2 forming a potentially strong hydrophobic residue binding pair. We note that these two key mutations, D614G and N501Y, are also found in the so-called South African (SA; B.1.351) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies along these lines are therefore aimed at mapping glue points to residue mutations and deletions of associated prefusion Spike protein variants in order to help direct and optimize efforts aimed at the mitigation of this deadly virion.",michael h peters; Oscar Basidas; Daniel Kokron; Christopher E.

195,Energetic and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein co-assemblies with nucleic acids,"Nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus packages the viral genome into well-defined ribonucleoprotein particles, but the molecular pathway is still unclear. N-protein is dimeric and consists of two folded domains with nucleic acid (NA) binding sites, surrounded by intrinsically disordered regions that promote liquid-liquid phase separation. Here we use biophysical tools to study N-protein interactions with oligonucleotides of different length, examining the size, composition, secondary structure, and energetics of the resulting states. We observe formation of supramolecular clusters or nuclei preceding growth into phase-separated droplets. Short hexanucleotide NA forms compact 2:2 N-protein/NA complexes with reduced disorder. Longer oligonucleotides expose additional N-protein interactions and multi-valent protein-NA interactions, which generate higher-order mixed oligomers and simultaneously promote growth of droplets. Phase separation is accompanied by a significant increase in protein secondary structure, different from that caused by initial NA binding, which may contribute to the assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles within molecular condensates.",Huaying Zhao; Di Wu; Ai Nguyen; Yan Li; Regina Ad&atildeo; Eugene Valkov; George H Patterson; Grzegorz Piszczek; Peter Schuck,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430344,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430344,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
196,GABA administration limits viral replication and pneumonitis in a mouse model of COVID-19,"Despite the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, serious illness and death induced by coronavirus infection will remain a global health burden because of vaccination hesitancy, possible virus mutations, and the appearance of novel coronaviruses. Accordingly, there is a need for new approaches to limit severe illness stemming from coronavirus infections. Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors for GABA (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We previously showed that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity and death rates in mice following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1) which provides a potentially lethal model of COVID-19. Here, we report that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary coronavirus replication. Histopathological analysis revealed that GABA treatment reduced lung inflammatory infiltrates and damages. Since GABA is safe for human consumption, inexpensive, and available worldwide, it is a promising candidate to help treat COVID-19.",Jide Tian; Blake Middleton; Daniel L Kaufman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430446,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430446,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
197,SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Risk from sports Equipment (STRIKE),"OBJECTIVESTo investigate the potential of shared sporting equipment as transmission vectors of SARS-CoV-2 during the reintroduction of sports such as soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and gymnastics.

SETTINGLaboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study

INTERVENTIONSTen different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREThe primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points.

RESULTSAt one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission.

CONCLUSIONSThis study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.

198,Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant,"IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with the occurrence since summer 2020 of several viral variants that overlapped or succeeded each other in time. Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477N substitution in this RBD.

Materials and methodsWe aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant.

ResultsAll 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93%) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 1,585/2,889 patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6%) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR.

DiscussionOur in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in more than half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.",Marielle Bedotto; Pierre-Edouard Fournier; Linda Houhamdi; Anthony LEVASSEUR; Jeremy Delerce; Lucine Pinault; Abdou Padane; Amanda CHAMIEH; Herve TISSOT-DUPONT; Philippe BROUQUI; Cheikh Sokhna; Eid Azar; Rachid Saile; Souleymane Mboup; Idir Bitam; Philippe Colson; Didier Raoult,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
199,TOP-Plus is a Versatile Biosensor Platform for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Durability,"BackgroundThere is a concern that low initial SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in individuals may drop to undetectable levels within months after infection. Although this may raise concerns over long term immunity, both the antibody levels and avidity of the antibody-antigen interaction should be examined to understand the quality of the antibody response.

MethodsA testing-on-a-probe ""plus"" panel (TOP-Plus) was developed, which included a newly developed avidity assay built into the previously described SARS-CoV-2 TOP assays that measured total antibody (TAb), surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb), IgM and IgG on a versatile biosensor platform. TAb and SNAb levels were compared with avidity in previously infected individuals at 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection in paired samples from 80 COVID-19 patients.

ResultsThe newly designed avidity assay in this TOP panel correlated well with a reference Bio-Layer Interferometry avidity assay (R=0.88). The imprecision of the TOP avidity assay was less than 9%. Although TAb and neutralization activity (by SNAb) decreased between 1.3 and 6.2 months post infection, the antibody avidity increased significantly (P < 0.0001).

ConclusionThis highly precise and versatile TOP-Plus panel with the ability to measure SARS-CoV-2 TAb, SNAb, IgG and IgM antibody levels and avidity of individual sera on one sensor can become a valuable asset in monitoring not only SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, but also the status of individuals COVID-19 vaccination response.",Sabrina E Racine-Brzostek; Mohsen Karbaschi; Christian Gaebler; PJ Klasse; Jim Yee; Marina Caskey; He S Yang; Ying Hao; Amy Chadburn; Yuanyuan Shi; Robert Zuk; Michel C Nussenzweig; Melissa M Cushing; Zhen Zhao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
200,"COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions August to December 2020, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany: a study of index cases and close contact cohorts","BackgroundThe lack of precise estimates on transmission risk hampers rational decisions on closure of educational institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsSecondary attack rates (SARs) for schools and day-care centres were calculated using data from state-wide mandatory notification of SARS-CoV-2 index cases in educational institutions and additional information on routine contact tracing and PCR-testing.

FindingsFrom August to December 2020, every sixth of overall 784 independent index cases caused a transmission in educational institutions (risk 0{middle dot}17, 95% CI 0{middle dot}14-0{middle dot}19). In a subgroup, monitoring of 14,594 institutional high-risk contacts (89% PCR-tested) of 441 index cases revealed 196 secondary cases (SAR 1{middle dot}34%, 1{middle dot}16-1{middle dot}54). Transmission was more likely from teachers than from students/children (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 3{middle dot}17, 1{middle dot}79-5{middle dot}59), and from index cases in day-care centres (IRR 3{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}76-5{middle dot}91) than from those in secondary schools. In 748 index cases, teachers caused four times more secondary cases than children (1{middle dot}08 vs. 0{middle dot}25 secondary cases per index, IRR 4{middle dot}39, 2{middle dot}67-7{middle dot}21). This difference was mainly due to common transmission from teacher index cases to teacher contacts (mean secondary cases 0{middle dot}56 teacher to teacher vs. 0{middle dot}04 child to teacher, IRR 13{middle dot}3, 6{middle dot}6-26{middle dot}7).

InterpretationIn educational institutions, the risk of contacts to a confirmed COVID-19 case for infection is one percent, but varies depending on type of institution and index case. Hygiene measures targeting the day-care setting and teacher-to-teacher transmission are priorities in reducing the burden of infection and may promote on-site education during the pandemic.

FundingNo particular funding was received for this study.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on Jan 27, 2021, without any language restrictions for all articles in which the title or abstract contained the search terms ""COVID 19"" or ""corona"", and ""school"", ""education*"", or ""daycare"", and ""transmission"", and ""risk"", ""attack rate"", or ""SAR"", and screened 175 results for original research or reviews on COVID-19 transmission risk in the educational setting. Following a similar strategy, we also searched Google Scholar, SSRN, medRxiv, and the reference lists of identified literature. We found one recent systematic review that pooled findings from five small-scale cohort studies on COVID-19 transmission risk published until 14th September 2020 on overall 18 index cases and 3,345 contact persons into a combined infection attack rate estimate of 0{middle dot}08% (95%CI 0{middle dot}00-0{middle dot}86). Since then, another three cohort studies on transmission risk in schools and day-care centres have been published from Germany and Italy including 135 index cases and 4,188 contact persons and reporting secondary attack rates between one and three percent.

The aforementioned systematic review found that, stratified by role of the index case, there was a non-significant trend towards higher infection attack rates in staff (0{middle dot}70%, 0{middle dot}00-3{middle dot}56) than in student index cases (0{middle dot}15%, 0{middle dot}00-0{middle dot}93), but recommended further research to confirm this trend. Similarly, a cross-sectional study using data from 30 outbreaks during the first COVID-19 wave in 2020 in the U.K. pointed towards an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 in staff compared to students.

A number of modelling studies from the first wave of COVID-19 provide inconclusive results. While two publications, one from several countries and one from Switzerland, concluded that school closures contributed markedly to the reduction of transmission and mobility, two other studies, one using cross-country data and one from Japan rated school closures among the least effective measures to reduce COVID-19 incidence rates.

Added value of this studyBy both, the number of index cases and contact persons studied, this cohort study is more than twice larger than the total of all published cohort studies on COVID-19 transmission risk in schools and day-care centres combined. Besides, this is the first study on transmission risk in schools to incorporate a period of drastically changing background incidence in the source population. Based on data that emerged from the current public health practice in Germany, which frequently incorporates routine PCR-testing during active follow-up of asymptomatic high-risk contacts to index cases, this study provides a precise estimate of the true underlying SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in schools and day-care centres. Thanks to the large sample size, this study allows for a meaningful examination of differences in the risk of transmission with respect to the characteristics of the index case. We found that the individual risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 among high-risk contacts in the educational setting is 1{middle dot}3%, but that this risk rises to 3{middle dot}2% when the index case is a teacher and to 2{middle dot}5% when the index case occurs in a day-care centre. Furthermore, we could show that, on average, teacher index case produced about four times as many secondary cases as student/child index cases. Despite the relatively small proportion of teachers among index cases (20%), our study of transmission pathways revealed that the majority of all secondary cases (54%), and the overwhelming majority of secondary cases in teachers (78%) were caused by teacher index cases.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn this setting, where preventative measures are in place and COVID-19 incidence rates were rising sharply in the population, we found a low and stable transmission risk in educational institutions, which provides evidence for the effectiveness of current preventative measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in schools. The identification of a substantial transmission risk within the group of teachers, but not between children/students and teachers indicates the need for an additional focus on infection prevention during teachers activities outside the classroom, e.g. in staff-meetings and in break rooms. Our findings on substantial variation in transmission risk can be useful for a more tailored risk assessment during the early phase of infection control in schools and day-care centres.

201,Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 stains harbouring the signature mutations of both A2a and A3 clade,"SARS-CoV-2 strains with both high transmissibility and potential to cause asymptomatic infection is expected to gain selective advantage over other circulating strains having either high transmissibility or ability to trigger asymptomatic infection. The D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein, the characteristic mutation A2a clade, has been associated with high transmissibility, whereas the A3 clade specific mutation L37F in NSP6 protein has been linked with asymptomatic infection. In this study, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected during January, 2020 to December, 2020 from all across the world for the presence of D614G and L37F mutations. Out of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 strains analysed, 14, 598 (3.87%) were found to harbour both the D614G and L37F mutations. Majority of these double mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified in Europe (11097) followed by North America (1915), Asia (980), Oceania (242), Africa (219), and South America (145). Geographical root surveillance revealed their first emergence during February-March in all the six continents. Temporal prevalence analysis from February, 2020 to December, 2020 showed a gradual upsurge in their frequencies worldwide, which strongly demonstrated the adaptive selection of these double mutants. Evolutionary analysis depicted that these double mutants emerged as a new clade in the dendrogram (named as A2a/3), and were sub-divided into four distinct clusters (Cluster I, II, III and IV) according to different sets of coexisting mutations. The frequency distribution pattern showed the global predominance of cluster III (41.42%), followed by cluster IV (23.31%), cluster II (21.02%) and cluster I (14.25%).

203,Inhaled budesonide in the treatment of early COVID-19 illness: a randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundMultiple early hospital cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed that patients with chronic respiratory disease were significantly under-represented. We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids was responsible for this finding and tested if inhaled glucorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19 illness.

MethodsWe conducted a randomised, open label trial of inhaled budesonide, compared to usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment.

Results146 patients underwent randomisation. For the per protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in 10 participants and 1 participant in the usual care and budesonide arms respectively (difference in proportion 0.131, p=0.004). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was 8. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide arm compared to the usual care arm (median of 7 days versus 8 days respectively, logrank test p=0.007). Proportion of days with a fever and proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide arm. Fewer participants randomised to budesonide had persistent symptoms at day 14 and day 28 compared to participants receiving usual care.

ConclusionEarly administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery following early COVID-19 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe majority of interventions studied for the COVID-19 pandemic are focused on hospitalised patients. Widely available and broadly relevant interventions for mild COVID-19 are urgently needed.

Added value of this studyIn this open label randomised controlled trial, inhaled budesonide, when given to adults with early COVID-19 illness, reduces the likelihood of requiring urgent care, emergency department consultation or hospitalisation. There was also a quicker resolution of fever, a known poor prognostic marker in COVID-19 and a faster self-reported and questionnaire reported symptom resolution. There were fewer participants with persistent COVID-19 symptoms at 14 and 28 days after budesonide therapy compared to usual care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe STOIC trial potentially provides the first easily accessible effective intervention in early COVID-19.

204,DrugWAS: Leveraging drug-wide association studies to facilitate drug repurposing for COVID-19,"ImportanceThere is an unprecedented need to rapidly identify safe and effective treatments for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ObjectiveTo systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as potential treatment for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBased on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data, drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on COVID-19 disease outcomes.

ExposuresPatient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in structured format.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause of death was selected as primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes.

ResultsThe study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized, 82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%) died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids), methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and fluticasone.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis cohort study leveraged EHR data to identify a list of drugs that could be repurposed to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of the proposed drugs.

205,Using Machine Learning to Predict Mortality for COVID-19 Patients on Day Zero in the ICU,"RationaleGiven the expanding number of COVID-19 cases and the potential for upcoming waves of infection, there is an urgent need for early prediction of the severity of the disease in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to optimize treatment strategies.

ObjectivesEarly prediction of mortality using machine learning based on typical laboratory results and clinical data registered on the day of ICU admission.

MethodsWe studied retrospectively 263 COVID-19 ICU patients. To find parameters with the highest predictive values, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Pearson chi-squared tests were used. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) algorithms were utilized to build classification models. The impact of each marker on the RF model predictions was studied by implementing the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation technique (LIME-SP).

ResultsAmong 66 documented parameters, 15 factors with the highest predictive values were identified as follows: gender, age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean cell hemoglobin along with a history of neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders. Our RF model can predict patients outcomes with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 75%.

ConclusionsThe most decisive variables in our model were increased levels of BUN, lowered albumin levels, increased creatinine, INR, and RDW along with gender and age. Complete blood count parameters were also crucial for some patients. Considering the importance of early triage decisions, this model can be a useful tool in COVID-19 ICU decision-making.",Elham Jamshidi; Amirhossein Asgary; Nader Tavakoli; Alireza Zali; Hadi Esmaily; Seyed Hamid Jamaldini; Amir Daaee; Amirhesam Babajani; Mohammad Ali Sendani Kashi; Masoud Jamshidi; Sahand Rahi; Nahal Mansouri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
206,Symptoms of COVID-19 infection and magnitude of antibody response in a large community-based study,"BackgroundThe majority of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic with management in the home. Little is known about the frequency of specific symptoms in the general population, and how symptoms predict the magnitude of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe quantified IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in home-collected dried blood spot samples from 3,365 adults participating in a community-based seroprevalence study in the city of Chicago, USA, collected between June 24 and November 11, 2020.

Results17.8% of the sample was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. A cluster of symptoms (loss of sense of smell or taste, fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headache) was associated with stronger anti-RBD IgG responses among the seropositives. 39.2% of infections were asymptomatic, and 2 or fewer symptoms were reported for 66.7% of infections. Total number of symptoms was positively but weakly associated with IgG response: Median anti-RBD IgG was 0.95 ug/mL for individuals with 3 or more symptoms, in comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for asymptomatic infections.

ConclusionWe document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection in a large community-based cohort, and relatively low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the general population of previously exposed individuals.",Thomas W McDade; Joshua Schrock; Richard D'Aquila; Brian Mustanski; Nanette Benbow; Lauren Vaught; Nina Reiser; Matt Velez; Ryan Hsieh; Daniel Ryan; Rana Saber; ELIZABETH MCNALLY; Alexis R.

207,Longitudinal serology in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India - a prospective cohort study,"Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are now widely available, but there are few data on longitudinal serology in large cohorts, particularly from low-and middle-income countries. We established an ongoing prospective cohort of 3840 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals in the Delhi-National Capital Region of India, to document clinical and immunological characteristics during illness and convalescence. The IgG responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0-7, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates in the post-infection windows of 0-7 days, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks were 46%, 84.7% and 85.3% respectively (n=782). The proportion with a serological response increased with severity of COVID-19 disease. All participants with severe disease, 89.6% with mild to moderate infection and 77.3% of asymptomatic participants had IgG antibodies to the RBD antigen. The threshold values in the nasopharyngeal viral RNA RT-PCR in a subset of asymptomatic and symptomatic seroconverters were comparable (p value: 0.48), with similar results among non-seroconverters (p value: 0.16) (n=169). This is the first report of longitudinal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a period of ten weeks from South Asia. The low seropositivity in asymptomatic participants and differences between assays highlight the importance of contextualizing the understanding of population serosurveys.

SummaryWe measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NC protein IgG in a multi-hospital-based prospective cohort from northern India up to ten weeks post-infection. The lower seroconversion rate among asymptomatic RT-PCR positive participants has public health significance particularly for interpreting community seroprevalence estimates.",Ramachandran Thiruvengadam; Souvick Chattopadhyay; Farha Mehdi; Bapu Koundinya Desiraju; Susmita Chaudhuri; Savita Singh; Vandita Bhartia; Pallavi Kshetrapal; Uma Chandra Mouli Natchu; Nitya Wadhwa; Shailaja Sopory; Mudita Gosain; Anil K Pandey; Asim Das; Nidhi Anand; Nandini Sharma; Pragya Sharma; Sonal Saxena; Deepa Sindhu; Brahmdeep Sindhu; Dharmendra Sharma; Navin Dang; Gaurav Batra; Gagandeep Kang; Shinjini Bhatnagar; - DBT India Consortium for COVID-19 Research,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251140,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251140,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
208,Introduction of a hand dermatitis clinic to reduce occupational dermatoses during the covid-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundThe SARS-Co-V pandemic has necessitated strict hand hygiene practices in healthcare settings. An increased incidence of staff presentations of occupational dermatitis in our institutions prompted the establishment of a drop-in access daily hand dermatitis clinic.

Objectiveto document the incidence and severity of cases of occupational dermatitis arising in healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic, and to reduce the impact of this with early assessment and treatment.

Methodsan open-access daily staff clinic run by dermatologists was established, and demographic and clinical data collected from each clinical encounter.

Results532 staff attended the clinic over a 6 week period. This compared to 7 staff presenting to occupational health over the same period in 2019. The majority were females 81%,and ward based 51%. ITU and A&E staff represented 15%. The prevalence of occupational hand dermatitis was 88%. 52% were classed as mild, 26% as moderate 26% and 9% severe/very severe.

Conclusionsthe pandemic and associated hand hygiene practices have led to a substantial increase in presentations of occupational hand dermatitis.

209,Assessment of Vaccination and Underreporting on COVID-19 Infections in Turkey Based On Effective Reproduction Number,"In this paper, we introduce a SEIR type COVID-19 model where the infected class is further divided into individuals in intensive care (ICUs) and ventilation units. The model is validated with the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and the number of patients in ICUs and ventilation units as reported by Turkey Department of Health for the period March 11 through May 30 when the nationwide lockdown is in order. COVID-19 interventions in Turkey are incorporated into the model to detect the future trend of the outbreak accurately. The lockdown is lifted on June 1, and the model is modified to include a time dependent transmission rate which is linked to the effective reproduction number [R]t through basic reproduction number [R]0. The modified model captures the changing dynamics and peaks of the outbreak successfully. With the onset of vaccination on 13 January 2021, we augment the model with the vaccination class to investigate the impact of vaccination rate and efficacy. We observe that vaccination rate is a more critical parameter than the vaccine efficacy to eliminate the disease successfully.",Emek Kose; Tugba Akman Yildiz; Necibe Tuncer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251176,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251176,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
210,COVID-19 prevention behaviour over time in Australia: Patterns and long-term predictors from April to July 2020,"BackgroundIn Australia in March 2020 a national public health directive required that non-essential workers stay at home, except for essential activities. These restrictions began easing in May 2020 as community transmission slowed.

PurposeThis study investigated changes in COVID-19 prevention behaviours from April-July 2020, and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours.

Methods1,843 participants in Australia completed a national COVID-19 survey in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Principal components analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours. Multivariable regression models explored baseline (April) correlates of behaviour in June (a period of low community transmission) and July (a period of increasing community transmission).

ResultsOn average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). PCA identified two behaviour types:  distancing (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and  hygiene (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing declined each month (ps<.001), whereas hygiene remained relatively stable. For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated with adherence in June and July (ps<0.05). For hygiene, the only significant correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that ones actions could prevent infection of family members (p<.001).

ConclusionsHigh adherence to COVID-19 prevention behaviours were reported; however, distancing behaviours tended to decrease over time. Belief in social responsibility may be an important aspect to consider in encouraging distancing behaviours. Different policy approaches may be needed for different behavioural categories.",Julie Ayre; Erin Cvejic; Kirsten J McCaffery; Tessa Copp; Samuel Cornell; Rachael H Dodd; Kristen Pickles; Carys Batcup; Jennifer MJ Isautier; Brooke Nickel; Thomas Dakin; Carissa Bonner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251165,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
211,Impact of school closures on the health and well-being of primary school children in Wales UK; a routine data linkage study using the HAPPEN survey (2018-2020).,"IntroductionIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, school closures were implemented across the United Kingdom. This study aimed to explore the impact of school closures on childrens health by comparing health and wellbeing outcomes collected during school closures (April - June 2020) with data from the same period in 2019 and 2018.

MethodsData were collected online via the  HAPPEN At Home survey, which captured the typical health behaviours of children aged 8 - 11 years between April - June 2020. These data were compared with data in 2018 and 2019 also collected between April-June, from HAPPEN. Free school meal (FSM) status was used as a proxy for socio-economic deprivation. Analyses were repeated stratifying by FSM.

ResultsComparing responses between April - June in 2020 (n=1068), 2019 (n=1150) and 2018 (n=475), there were improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM ate less fruit and vegetables (21% (95%CI (5.7% to 37%)) and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity (13.03% (95%CI: 3.3% to 21.7%) and consumed more takeaways (16.3% (95%CI: 2%-30%)) during school closures.

ConclusionThis study suggests that schools play an important role in reducing inequalities in physical health. The physical health (e.g. physical activity and diet) of children eligible for FSM may be impacted by prolonged school closures.

What is already known on this subject?In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, by mid-March 2020, 138 countries had implemented national school closures to reduce the number of social contacts between pupils, therefore interrupting the transmission of COVID-19 as part of pandemic plans. UNESCO warned that the global scale and speed of the educational disruption would be unparalleled. There is an ongoing debate with regard to the effectiveness of schools closures on transmission rates, but the fact schools are closed for a long period of time could have detrimental impacts on pupils physical and mental health.

This study provides evidence of any differences in the health and wellbeing of children prior to and during the COVID-19 enforced lockdown and school closures between March and June 2020. These findings could have a significant impact for the future and support schools to better understand their pupils physical, psychological, emotional and social health. It also contributes to a significant literature gap regarding the impact of school closures on school-aged children.

What this study adds?Improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing were observed in general for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM reported eating less fruit and vegetables and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity and consumed more takeaways during school closures. These trends are not evident among children not on FSM. All children reported improvements in wellbeing during lockdown especially on the happiness with family measure.

Overall, findings suggest schools help to reduce inequalities in physical health for socio-economically deprived children. During school closures children from deprived backgrounds are likely to have poorer physical health (e.g. less time spent doing physical activities and poorer diet) and this is not observed in children who are not in receipt of FSM. This research suggests that school closures will result in widening health inequalities and when schools return measures will need to be in place to readdress the widened gap in physical health.",Michaela James; Emily Marchant; Margaret A Defeyter; Jayne V Woodside; Sinead Brophy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
212,Enhancing Food Security for Families Vulnerable to COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some of the underlying inequities in our society. Vulnerable and low-income communities who have typically struggled with food insecurity have been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To make matters worse, transit dependent households in the City of Detroit that rely on SNAP benefits from the government have a 54% probability of not having internet access, reducing the possibility of online food delivery. Thus, the motivation for the Detroit Food Delivery Pilot Program, a prepared meal delivery service for food insecure households during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, the City had aided 350 households; over 1,000 unique individuals and has served over 90,000 meals. This had all been made possible through the engagement of 575 volunteers, volunteering over 6,850 delivery miles. Our team helped to identify the magnitude and the needs of the Citys food insecure population; then partnered with the City of Detroit to modify existing food programs to address the crisis, and finally, assessed the impact of the program on the target population. Our analysis revealed that approximately 20,800 households will be classified as food insecure in Detroit and only a fraction of this population is benefitting from the food delivery pilot program. However, on average, the concerns about food sufficiency have abated appreciably from the surveys analyzed. Responses from the beneficiaries of the food delivery pilot program were positive though concerns about the travel behavior of individuals, particularly those from COVID-19 positive households remain.",Tayo Fabusuyi; Aditi Misra; Jon Martinez; Andong Chen; Vivian Jiang; H.

213,Staff-Pupil SARS-CoV-2 Infection Pathways in Schools: A Population Level Linked Data Approach,"BackgroundBetter understanding of the role that children and school staff play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to guide policy development on controlling infection whilst minimising disruption to childrens education and wellbeing.

MethodsOur national e-cohort (n=500,779) study used anonymised linked data for pupils, staff and associated households linked via educational settings. We estimated the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff and pupils over the period August - December 2020, dependent on measures of recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational settings.

ResultsThe total number of cases in a school was not associated with a subsequent increase in the risk of testing positive (Staff OR per case 0.92, 95%CI 0.85, 1.00; Pupils OR per case 0.98, 95%CI 0.93, 1.02). Amongst pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased risk of testing positive (OR per case 1.12, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.15). These effects were adjusted for a range of demographic covariates, and in particular any known cases within the same household, which had the strongest association with testing positive (Staff OR 39.86, 95%CI 35.01, 45.38, pupil OR 9.39, 95%CI 8.94 - 9.88).

ConclusionsIn a national school cohort, the odds of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not significantly increased in the 14-day period after case detection in the school. However, pupils were found to be at increased risk, following cases appearing within their own year group, where most of their contacts occur. Strong mitigation measures over the whole of the study period may have reduced wider spread within the school environment.

214,A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic,"The effective reproduction number Reff is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic.

In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted with Bayesian inference (PMCMC) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland.

This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data, without any specific hypothesis on its evolution. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its Reff(t). In this way, we can appropriately assess the effect of the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland.",Bernard Cazelles; Clara Champagne; Benjamin Nguyen Van Yen; Catherine Comiskey; Elisabeta Vergu; Benjamin Roche,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
215,Mapping internet activity in Australian cities during COVID-19 lockdown: how occupational factors drive inequality,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence has accumulated that movement restrictions enacted to combat virus spread produce disparate consequences along socioeconomic lines. One explanation for this differential impact is the distribution of people into occupations that can be performed from home and may provide greater financial security. However, little is known about the nature and scale of shifting home-based work patterns and their geographic distribution, despite this being a likely determinant of the success of geographically defined COVID-19 lockdown strategies. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure employment are better able to adapt to mobility restrictions, due to common occupational factors. In the context of two Australian urban centres, we test this hypothesis by analysing changes to home-based internet usage and quantify the relationship between area-level measures of population income security, the ability to perform job requirements remotely, and the degree of transition to home-based work during COVID-19. Our analysis confirms that financial security in Australia is geographically clustered and concentrated. Income security is also correlated with increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown, and home-based work patterns that persist post-lockdown. Our findings suggest that geographic diversity in preparedness for government-imposed restrictions should be factored into response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas.",Cameron Zachreson; Erika Martino; Martin Tomko; Freya M Shearer; Rebecca Bentley; Nicholas Geard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
216,Development and validation of an algorithm to estimate the risk of severe complications of COVID-19 to prioritise vaccination,"ObjectiveTo develop an algorithm (sCOVID) to predict the risk of severe complications of COVID- 19 in a community-dwelling population to optimise vaccination scenarios.

DesignPopulation based cohort study

Setting264 Dutch general practices contributing to the NL-COVID database

Participants6074 people aged 0-99 diagnosed with COVID-19

Main outcome measuresSevere complications (hospitalisation, institutionalisation, death). The algorithm was developed from a training dataset comprising 70% of the patients and validated in the remaining 30%. Potential predictor variables included age, sex, a chronic co-morbidity score (CCS) based on risk factors for COVID-19 complications as defined by the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), obesity, neighborhood deprivation score (NDS), first or second COVID wave, and confirmation test. Six different population vaccination scenarios were explored: 1) random (naive), 2) random for persons above 60 years (60plus), 3) oldest patients first in age bands of five years (oldest first), 4) target population of the annual influenza vaccination program (influenza) and 5) those 25-65 years of age first (worker), and 6) risk-based using the prediction algorithm (sCOVID). For each vaccination strategy the amount of vaccinations needed to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was calculated.

ResultsSevere complications were reported in 243 (4.8%) people with 59 (20.3%) nursing home admissions, 181 (62.2%) hospitalisations and 51 (17.5%) deaths. The algorithm included age, sex, CCS, NDS, wave, and confirmation test with a c statistic of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94) in the validation set. Applied to different vaccination scenarios, the proportion of people needed to be vaccinated to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was 67.5%, 50.0%, 26.1%, 16.0%, 10.0%, and 8.4% for the worker, naive, infuenza, 60plus, oldest first, and sCOVID scenarios respectively.

ConclusionCOVID-19 related severe complications will be reduced most efficiently when vaccinations are risk-based, prioritizing the highest risk group using the sCOVID algorithm. The vaccination scenario, prioritising oldest people in age bands of 5 years down to 60 years of age, performed second best. The sCOVID algorithm can readily be applied to identify persons with highest risks from data in the electronic health records of GPs.

Four adenovirus vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have advanced into phase 3 trials, with three approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD) or dimeric tandem-repeat RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular (Th1-based) immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared with both AdC7-S and AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury.

218,Impact of cobas PCR Media Freezing on SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Integrity and Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses,"SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is an important molecular biology tool performed to support many aspects of the response to the pandemic. Freezing of primary clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples and shipment to reference laboratories is usually required since RNA sequencing is rarely available in routine clinical microbiology laboratories where initial diagnosis and support to outbreak investigations occur. The cobas PCR Media transport medium developed by Roche facilitates high throughput analyses on cobas multianalyzer PCR platforms. There is no data on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after freezing and thawing of clinical samples in this transport medium, but potential denaturing of the molecular template could impair test results. Our objective was to compare the quality and results of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing when performed on fresh or frozen samples in cobas PCR Media. Viral whole genome sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. Genomic coverage and sequencing depth did not significantly differ between fresh and frozen samples (n=10). For samples with lower viral inoculum and PCR cycle threshold above 30, sequencing quality scores and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ either. Freezing of cobas PCR Media does not negatively affect the quality of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing results and it is therefore a suitable transport medium for outsourcing sequencing analyses to reference laboratories.

219,Longitudinal Metabolomics of Human Plasma Reveals Robust Prognostic Markers of COVID-19 Disease Severity,"There is an urgent need to identify which COVID-19 patients will develop life-threatening illness so that scarce medical resources can be optimally allocated and rapid treatment can be administered early in the disease course, when clinical management is most effective. To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we performed untargeted metabolomics profiling of 341 patients with plasma samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we then built a predictive model of disease severity. We determined that the levels of 25 metabolites measured at the time of hospital admission successfully predict future disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirmed that these prognostic markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validated that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19. Our results indicate that metabolic changes associated with COVID-19 severity can be effectively used to stratify patients and inform resource allocation during the pandemic.",Miriam Sindelar; Ethan Stancliffe; Michaela Schwaiger-Haber; Dhanalakshmi S Anbukumar; Randy A Albrecht; wen-chun Liu; Kayla Adkins-Travis; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Leah P Shriver; Gary J Patti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251173,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251173,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

However, little is known about the persistence of the antibody response.

We evaluated that the kinetics of anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody of SARS-CoV2 infected healthcare workers in COVID-19 cluster occurred hospital. The long-term kinetics of anti-N antibody was classified high and keep pattern, high and decay pattern, and low and keep pattern. COVID-19 contact and symptomaticity was not related to kinetic patterns.

222,Modelling the impact of contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic,"OBJECTIVESWith declining numbers of COVID-19 cases in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, social distancing measures were gradually being lifted. The risk of an increase in the number of cases, however, cannot be overlooked. Even with the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as restrictions on mass gatherings, wearing masks, and complete or partial closure of schools, other public health measures may help to control the epidemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic regardless of the use of diagnostic testing.

METHODSWe developed a mathematical model that includes isolation of symptomatic individuals and tracing of contacts to assess the effects of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of Sao Paulo.

RESULTSFor a selection efficacy (proportion of isolated contacts who are infected) of 80%, cases and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other hand, for a selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no contact tracing strategy is performed.

CONCLUSIONContact tracing of symptomatic individuals may be a potential alternative strategy when the number of diagnostic tests available is not sufficient for a massive testing strategy.",Marcos Amaku; Dimas Tadeu Covas; Francisco Antonio Bezerra Coutinho; Raymundo Soares Azevedo; Eduardo Massad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251222,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251222,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
223,Outdoor transmission of COVID-19: Analysis of windspeed,"BackgroundTo examine whether outdoor exposures may contribute to the COVID-19 epidemic, we hypothesized that slower outdoor windspeed is associated with increased risk of transmission when individuals socialize outside.

MethodsDaily COVID-19 incidence reported between 3/16/2020-12/31/2020 was the outcome. Average windspeed and maximal daily temperature were derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Negative binomial regression was used to model incidence, adjusting for susceptible population size.

ResultsCases were very high in the initial wave but diminished quickly once lockdown procedures were enacted. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed that warmer days with windspeed <5.5 MPH had increased COVID-19 incidence (aIRR=1.50, 95% C.I.=[1.25-1.81], P<0.001) as compared to days with average windspeed [&ge;]5.5 MPH.

ConclusionThis study suggests that outdoor transmission of COVID-19 may occur by noting that the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the summer was highest on days when wind was reduced.",Sean Clouston; Olga Morozova; Jaymie Meliker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251179,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251179,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
224,UK and other SARS-CoV-2-Covariants - Simulation Modeling 70% Increase,"CovidSIMVL, an agent-based contagion-based viral transmission simulation tool, was employed to simulate the effects of viral agents of differing levels of infectivity. The constructs ""Velocity"" and ""Increase in Velocity"" were operationalized in terms of rates of transmission events over successive iterations (generations) in a set of CovidSIMVL trials. Treating 40-70% increase in velocity as a target, based on reports in the literature for the UK variant (VUI 202012/01), the series of trials reported in the paper demonstrate the calibration of CovidSIMVL parameters to produce increases in transmission rates of 40-70% above a baseline value. A series of follow-up studies is proposed to evaluate three different possible explanations for reported increases in SARS-Cov2-2 infections that are being attributed to spread of the UK and other variants: (a) simulations where the inherent characteristics of the virus (infectivity) are varied (genomic studies); (b) simulations where the behaviour of agents is varied (e.g., movement within and between spaces) while inherent characteristics of the virus are held constant (behavioural studies); and (c) simulations where both inherent properties of the virus and the behaviour of agents are varying to ""tease out"" the interaction between biologically-based contributions to increased case counts, and contextual/behavioural contributions (epigenetic studies).",Ernie Chang; Kenneth Andrew Moselle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251230,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251230,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
225,How effective was Newfoundland & Labrador's travel ban to prevent the spread of COVID-19? An agent-based analysis,"To prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Newfoundland & Labrador (NL), NL implemented a wide travel ban in May 2020. We estimate the effectiveness this travel ban using a customized agent-based simulation (ABS). Our individual-level ABS simulates the movements and behaviors of every member of the NL population, including arriving and departing travellers. The model considers individual properties (spatial location, age, comorbidities) and movements between environments, as well as age-based disease transmission with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic transmission rates. We examine low, medium, and high travel volume, traveller infection rates, and traveller quarantine compliance rates to determine the effect of travellers on COVID spread, and the ability of contact tracing to contain outbreaks. Infected travellers increased cases by 9-136x times and peak hospitalizations by 9-149x, without contact tracing. Although contact tracing was highly effective at reducing spread, it was insufficient to stop outbreaks caused by travellers in even the best-case scenario, and the likelihood of exceeding contact tracing capacity was a concern in most scenarios. Quarantine compliance had only a small impact on COVID spread; travel volume and infection rate drove spread. Thus, NL's travel ban was likely a critically important intervention to prevent COVID spread. Even a small number of infected travellers can play a significant role in introducing new chains of transmission, resulting in exponential community spread and significant increases in hospitalizations, while outpacing contact tracing capabilities. With the presence of more transmissible variants, e.g., the UK variant, prevention of imported cases is even more critical.",Dionne M Aleman; Benjamin Z Tham; Sean J Wagner; Justin Semelhago; Asghar Mohammadi; Paul Price; Randy Giffen; Proton Rahman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251157,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251157,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
226,Design and Estimation for the Population Prevalence of Infectious Diseases,"Understanding the prevalence of infections in the population of interest is critical for making data-driven public health responses to infectious disease outbreaks. Accurate prevalence estimates, however, can be difficult to calculate due to a combination of low population prevalence, imperfect diagnostic tests, and limited testing resources. In addition, strategies based on convenience samples that target only symptomatic or high-risk individuals will yield biased estimates of the population prevalence. We present Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification models that incorporate probability sampling designs, the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test, and specimen pooling to obtain unbiased prevalence estimates. These models easily incorporate all available prior information and can yield reasonable inferences even with very low base rates and limited testing resources. We examine the performance of these models with an extensive numerical study that varies the sampling design, sample size, true prevalence, and pool size. We also demonstrate the relative robustness of the models to key prior distribution assumptions via sensitivity analyses.",Eric J Oh; Alyssa Mikytuck; Vicki Lancaster; Joshua Goldstein; Sallie Keller,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251231,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251231,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
227,INCLUSIVE HEALTH: MODELING COVID-19 IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND COMMUNITIES,"Mass incarceration, commonly associated with overcrowding and inadequate health resources for incarcerated people, creates a fertile environment for the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in U.S. correctional facilities. The exact role that correctional facilities play in enhancing COVID-19 spread and enabling community re-emergence of COVID-19 is unknown. We constructed a novel stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission to estimate the impact of correctional facilities, specifically jails and state prisons, for enhancing disease transmission and enabling disease re-emergence in local communities. Using our model, we evaluated scenarios of testing and quarantining infected incarcerated people at 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 times the rate that occurs for infected people in the local community for population sizes of 5, 10, and 20 thousand people. Our results illustrate testing and quarantining an incarcerated population of 800 would reduce the probability of a major community outbreak by 6% and also prevent between 250 to 730 incidences of COVID-19 per year, depending on local community size. These findings illustrate that managing COVID-19 in correctional facilities is essential to mitigate risks to community health, and thereby stresses the importance of improving the health standards of incarcerated people.",Scott Greenhalgh; Ashley Provencher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251174,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251174,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
228,Modeling the Effect of Population-Wide Vaccination on the Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in Canada,"Population-wide vaccination is critical for containing the COVID-19 pandemic when combined with effective testing and prevention measures. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, several companies worked tirelessly for the development of an efficient vaccine that would put an end to this pandemic. Today, a number of COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use by a number of national regulatory organizations. Vaccination campaigns have already started in several countries with different daily-vaccination rates depending on the countrys vaccination capacity. Therefore, we find it timely and extremely important to conduct a study on the effect of population-wide vaccination campaigns on the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. To this end, we propose a new deterministic mathematical model to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic evolution under the effect of vaccination and vaccine efficacy. This model, referred to as SIRV, consists of a compartmental SIR (susceptible, infectious and removed) model augmented with an additional state V representing the effectively vaccinated population as well as two inputs representing the daily-vaccination rate and the vaccine efficacy. Using our SIRV model, we predict the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada and its most affected provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), for different daily vaccination rates and vaccine efficacy. Projections suggest that, without vaccination, 219, 000 lives could be lost across Canada by the end of 2021 due to COVID-19. The ongoing vaccination campaign across Canada seems to unfold relatively slowly at an average daily rate close to 1/2 vaccine per 1, 000 population. At this pace, we could be saving more than 77, 496 lives by the end of the year. Doubling the current vaccination efforts (1 vaccine per day per 1, 000 population) could be sufficient to save 125, 839 lives in Canada during the current year 2021. We would like to point out that our study assumes that the vaccine is perfectly safe without any short or long term side-effects. This study has been conducted independently at arms length from vaccine manufacturers, using the available data from Canada health services. This study can be easily adapted to other places in the world.",Intissar Harizi; Soulaimane Berkane; Abdelhamid Tayebi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250572,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
229,Engagement with COVID-19 Public Health Measures in the United States: A Cross-Sectional Social Media Analysis from June to November 2020,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to spread in the US and globally. Closely monitoring public engagement and perception of COVID-19 and preventive measures using social media data could provide important information for understanding the progress of current interventions and planning future programs.

ObjectiveTo measure the publics behaviors and perceptions regarding COVID-19 and its daily life effects during the recent 5 months of the pandemic.

MethodsNatural language processing (NLP) algorithms were used to identify COVID-19 related and unrelated topics in over 300 million online data sources from June 15 to November 15, 2020. Posts in the sample were geotagged, and sensitivity and specificity were both calculated to validate the classification of posts. The prevalence of discussion regarding these topics was measured over this time period and compared to daily case rates in the US.

ResultsThe final sample size included 9,065,733 posts, 70% of which were sourced from the US. In October and November, discussion including mentions of COVID-19 and related health behaviors did not increase as it had from June to September, despite an increase in COVID-19 daily cases in the US beginning in October. Additionally, counter to reports from March and April, discussion was more focused on daily life topics (69%), compared with COVID-19 in general (37%) and COVID-19 public health measures (20%).

ConclusionsThere was a decline in COVID-19-related social media discussion sourced mainly from the US, even as COVID-19 cases in the US have increased to the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic.

Here we examined whether sera and monoclonal antibodies from convalescent donors, prior to and following a single immunization with the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines, neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain and a variant, B.1.351 from South Africa. Pre-vaccination sera weakly neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351. Immunization with either vaccine generated anamnestic B and CD4+ T cell responses and a 1000-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers against both strains and SARS-CoV-1. Neutralization was likely due to anti-RBD and anti-S2 antibodies. Our study highlights the importance of vaccination of both uninfected and of previously infected subjects, as the elicited immune response will neutralize distinct viral strains.",Leonidas Stamatatos; Julie Czartoski; Yu-Hsin Wan; Leah Homad; Vanessa Rubin; Hayley Glantz; Moni Neradilek; Emilie Seydoux; Madeleine F.

231,Immune cell residency in the nasal mucosa and COVID-19 severity across the age range,"Severe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) positively correlates with age (Centers for Disease Control), develops after progression of infection from the upper airway to the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and can worsen into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Shi et al., 2020). Why children seem to be less likely to develop severe disease remains unclear. As the nasal mucosa (NM) is the first site of contact and defense for respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 before dissemination to the LRT (Casadei and Salinas, 2019), we hypothesized that differences in this tissue across the age range may help explain the disparity in COVID-19 severity. To this end, we profiled NM samples across the lifespan in health and disease. We find that global transcriptomic changes including the expression of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors are not correlated with age or the novel virus type, since pediatric NM cells mount similar antiviral response to both SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza B. Rather, we find immune cell residency in NM decreases dramatically with age especially cells of the innate immune system. This includes a resident-memory-like T cell subset with antiviral properties. These observations give plausible biological explanation to the observed clinical differences in disease spectrum and provide a foundation for future experimental studies.",Konner Winkley; Dithi Banerjee; Daniel Louiselle; Rebecca Biswell; Nyshele Posey; Kelly Fatheree; Stephanie McDanel; Todd Bradley; Mary E.

232,Emergence of an early SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the United States,"The emergence of the early COVID-19 epidemic in the United States (U.S.) went largely undetected, due to a lack of adequate testing and mitigation efforts. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana experienced one of the earliest and fastest accelerating outbreaks, coinciding with the annual Mardi Gras festival, which went ahead without precautions. To gain insight into the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and how large, crowded events may have accelerated early transmission, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Louisiana. We show that SARS-CoV-2 in Louisiana initially had limited sequence diversity compared to other U.S. states, and that one successful introduction of SARS-CoV-2 led to almost all of the early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Louisiana. By analyzing mobility and genomic data, we show that SARS-CoV-2 was already present in New Orleans before Mardi Gras and that the festival dramatically accelerated transmission, eventually leading to secondary localized COVID-19 epidemics throughout the Southern U.S.. Our study provides an understanding of how superspreading during large-scale events played a key role during the early outbreak in the U.S. and can greatly accelerate COVID-19 epidemics on a local and regional scale.",Mark Zeller; Karthik Gangavarapu; Catelyn Anderson; Allison R.

A nationwide case-control study,"ObjectiveTo determine the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 among teachers and their household members, overall and compared to healthcare workers and the general working-age population.

DesignPopulation-based nested case-control study.

SettingsScotland, March 2020 to January 2021. Before and after schools re-opened in early August 2020.

ParticipantsAll cases of COVID-19 in Scotland in adults ages 21 to 65 (n = 83,817) and a random sample of controls matched on age, sex and general practice (n = 841,708).

ExposureIndividuals identified as actively teaching in a Scottish school by the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and household members of such individuals identified via the Unique Property Reference Number.

ComparatorIndividuals identified as healthcare workers in Scotland, their household members, and the remaining ""general population"" of working-age adults.

Main outcomesThe primary outcome was hospitalisation with COVID-19 defined in anyone testing positive with COVID-19 in hospital, admitted to hospital within 28 days of a positive test, and/or diagnosed with COVID-19 on discharge from hospital. Severe COVID-19 was defined as individuals admitted to intensive care or dying within 28 days of a positive test or assigned COVID-19 as a cause of death.

ResultsMost teachers were young (mean age 42), female (80%) and had no underlying conditions (84%). The cumulative incidence (risk) of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was below 1% for all of the working age adults. In the period after school re-opening, compared to the general population, in conditional logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, general practice, deprivation, underlying conditions and number of adults in the household, the relative risk in teachers (among 18,479 cases and controls) for hospitalisation was rate ratio (RR) 0.97 (95%CI 0.72-1.29) and for severe COVID-19 was RR 0.27 (95%CI 0.09-0.77). Equivalent rate ratios for household members of teachers were 0.97 (95%CI 0.74-1.27) and 0.67 (95%CI 0.36-1.24), and for healthcare workers were 1.82 (95%CI 1.55-2.14) and 1.76 (95%CI 1.22-2.56), respectively.

To assess evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections among children and adolescents in Mississippi, serologic testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was conducted on a convenience sample of residual serum specimens collected for routine laboratory testing by an academic medical center laboratory during May 17 through September 19, 2020. Seroprevalence by calendar month was standardized to the state population by race/ethnicity; cumulative numbers of infections were estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to all those aged <18 years in Mississippi. Serum specimens from 1,603 individuals were tested; 175 (10.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 1,579 (98.5%) individuals for whom race/ethnicity was known, the number testing positive was 16 (23.2%) of 69 Hispanic individuals, 117 (13.0%) of 901 non-Hispanic Black individuals and 30 (5.3%) of 565 non-Hispanic White individuals. Population-weighted seroprevalence estimates among those aged <18 years increased from 2.6% in May to 16.9% in September 2020. Cumulative numbers of infections extrapolated from seroprevalence data, however, were estimated at 117,805 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 68,771-168,708), suggesting that cases in children and adolescents are much higher than what was reported to the Mississippi State Department of Health (9,044 cases during this period).

India has also lost several lives, making the country fourth most deadly worldwide. However, the infection and death rate per million and the case fatality ratio in India were substantially lower than many of the developed nations. Several factors have been proposed including the genetics. One of the important facts is that a large chunk of Indian population is asymptomatic to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the real infection in India is much higher than the reported number of cases. Therefore, the majority of people are already immune in the country. To understand the dynamics of real infection as well as level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, we have performed antibody testing (serosurveillance) in the urban region of fourteen Indian districts encompassing six states. In our survey, the seroprevalence frequency varied between 0.01-0.48, suggesting high variability of viral transmission among states. We also found out that the cases reported by the Government were several fold lower than the real infection. This discrepancy is majorly driven by a higher number of asymptomatic cases. Overall, we suggest that with the high level of immunity developed against SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of the districts, it is less likely to have a second wave in India.",Prajjval Pratap Singh; Rakesh Tamang; Manoj Shukla; Abhishek Pathak; Anshika Srivastava; Pranav Gupta; Alay Bhatt; Abhishek K.

236,"COVID-19 increases age- and sex-controlled 21-day fatality rates for patients with melanoma, hematologic malignancies, uterine cancer, or kidney cancer","IntroductionPrior research has reported an increased risk of fatality for cancer patients, but most studies investigated the risk by comparing cancer patients to non-cancer patients among COVID-19 infections. Only a few studies have compared the impact of a COVID-19 infection to non-infection with matched cancer patients and types.

Methods & MaterialsWe conducted survival analyses of 4,606 cancer patients with COVID-19 test results from March 16 to October 11, 2020 in UK Biobank and estimated the overall hazard ratio of fatality with and without COVID-19 infection. We also examined the hazard ratios of thirteen specific cancer types with at least 100 patients.

ResultsCOVID-19 resulted in an overall hazard ratio of 7.76 (95% CI: [5.78, 10.40], p<10-10) by studying the survival rate of 4,606 cancer patients for 21-days after the tests. The hazard ratio was shown to vary among cancer type, with over a 10-fold increase in fatality rate (false discovery rate[&le;]0.02) for melanoma, hematologic malignancies, uterine cancer, and kidney cancer using a stratified analysis on each of the cancer types. Although COVID-19 imposed a higher risk for localized cancers compared to distant metastasis ones, those of distant metastasis yielded higher fatality rates due to their multiplicative effects.

ConclusionThe results highlight the importance of timely care for localized and hematological cancer patients and the necessity to vaccinate uninfected patients as soon as possible, particularly for the cancer types influenced most by COVID-19.",Haiquan Li; Edwin Alexander Baldwin; Xiang Zhang; Colleen Kenost; Wenting Luo; Elizabeth A Calhoun; Lingling An; Charles L Bennett; Yves A Lussier,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251099,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251099,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
237,Molecular Mechanism of Parosmia,"The molecular stimuli that trigger a parosmic response have been identified. Parosmia is a debilitating disease in which familiar smells become distorted and unpleasant. Often a result of post infectious smell loss, incidences are increasing as the number of COVID-19 cases escalates worldwide. Little is understood of its pathophysiology, but the prevailing hypothesis for the underlying mechanism is a mis-wiring of olfactory sensory neurons. We identified 15 different molecular triggers in coffee using GC-Olfactometry as a relatively rapid screening tool for assessment of both quantitative olfactory loss and parosmia.

238,Automated Detection of COVID-19 through Convolutional Neural Network using Chest x-ray images,"The COVID-19 epidemic appears to have a catastrophic impact on global well-being and public health. More than 10 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide until now. Due to the growing number of confirmed cases, timely and accurate classification of healthy and infected patients is essential to control and treat COVID-19. To this end, in this paper, we aim to develop a deep learning-based system for the persuasive classification and reliable detection of COVID-19 using chest radiography. Firstly, we evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proposed over recent years for medical image classification. Secondly, we develop and train CNN from scratch. In both cases, we use a recently published public X-Ray dataset for training and validation purposes. For transfer learning, we obtain 100% accuracy for binary classification (i.e., Normal/COVID-19) and 87.50% accuracy for tertiary classification (Normal/COVID-19/Pneumonia). With the CNN trained from scratch, we achieve 93.75% accuracy for tertiary classification. We observe, in the case of transfer learning, the classification accuracy drops with an increased number of classes. Our comprehensive ROC and confusion metric analysis with 10-fold cross-validation strongly underpin our findings.",Rubina Sarki; Khandakar Ahmed; Hua Wang; Yanchun Zhang; Kate Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251271,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251271,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
239,Clinical and Economic Impact of Widespread Rapid Testing to Decrease SARS-CoV-2 Transmission,"BackgroundThe value of frequent, rapid testing to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiological, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based, antigen testing.

DesignA simple compartmental epidemic model estimated viral transmission, clinical history, and resource use, with and without testing.

Data SourcesParameter values and ranges informed by Centers for Disease Control guidance and published literature.

Target PopulationUnited States population.

Time Horizon60 days.

PerspectiveSocietal.Costs include: testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays.

InterventionHome-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing.

Outcome MeasuresCumulative infections and deaths, numbers isolated and/or hospitalized, and total costs.

Results of Base-Case AnalysisWithout a testing intervention, the model anticipates 15 million infections, 125,000 deaths, and $10.4 billion in costs ($6.5 billion inpatient; $3.9 billion lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing may avert 4 million infections and 19,000 deaths, raising costs by $21.5 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.0 billion) and workdays lost ($13.9 billion), yielding incremental costs per infection (death) averted of $5,400 ($1,100,000).

Results of Sensitivity AnalysisOutcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios: large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations; and costs per death averted roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5-17 million).

LimitationsAnalysis restricted to at-home testing and limited by uncertainties about test performance.

ConclusionHigh-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 using an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.

Based on samples from 63 COVID-19 survivors up to seven months after symptom onset, and on 50 serum samples taken before the beginning of the pandemic, we compared the performance of three commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies (Euroimmun SARS-COV-2 IgA/IgG, Mikrogen recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, and SERION ELISA agile SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG) and three rapid lateral flow (immunochromatographic) tests (Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM, NADAL COVID-19 IgG/IgM, and Cleartest Corona 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM) with a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) representing the gold standard. In addition, we report and validate a novel, non-commercial flow cytometry bead-based surrogate test.

57 out of 63 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (90 %) showed neutralizing antibodies. The sensitivity of the seven assays ranged from 7.0 % to 98.3 %, the specificity from 86.0 % to 100.00 %.

243,Assessment & mitigation of O2 therapy driven spread of COVID-19,"BACKGROUNDExhalation exposure from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs), while using a nasal cannula or simple O2 mask used in treating COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, is a present and future risk. Little is known on exhalation dispersal through these devices, and on mitigating the viral exposure to those in the vicinity.

METHODSRespiration through O2 therapy devices was studied with a supine manikin equipped with a controllable mechanical lung by measuring aerosol density and flow with direct imaging. Dispersal direction and distances were quantified while placing a surgical mask loosely over the devices and contrasted with unmitigated oxygenation device use. Exhalation jets were examined over the entire range of oxygenation rates used in treatment.

RESULTSExhalation jets travel 0.35 {+/-} 0.02 m upward while wearing a nasal cannula, and 0.29 {+/-} 0.02 m laterally while wearing a simple O2 mask posing significant inhalation risk. Placing a surgical facemask loosely over the oxygenation device is demonstrated to alleviate exposure by reducing and deflecting the exhalation jets from being launched forward, and by reducing exhalations from being launched directly higher over a supine patient. Less than 12% of the exhaled breath is observed to reach above a masked face where HCWs would be present, independent of oxygen flow rates.

CONCLUSIONSExhalation jets from both the nasal cannula or simple O2 mask were found to concentrate aerosol-laden exhalations directly in front of a patients face. Exposure is effectively mitigated with a surgical mask which reduces and redirects the exhalation downward away from HCWs.",Arshad Kudrolli; Brian Chang; Jade Consalvi; Anton Deti; Christopher Frechette; Helen Scoville; Geoffrey R.

MethodsSetting: Charite Fatigue Center with clinical immunologists and rheumatologist, neurologists and cardiologists at Charite University hospital.

Participants: 42 patients who presented with persistent moderate to severe fatigue six months following a mostly mild SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Charite Fatigue Center from July to November 2020.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were clinical and paraclinical data and meeting diagnostic criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant neurological and cardiopulmonary morbidity was excluded.

ResultsThe median age was 36.5, range 22-62, 29 patients were female and 13 male. At six months post acute COVID-19 all patients had fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Score median 25 of 33, range 14-32), the most frequent other symptoms were post exertional malaise (n=41), cognitive symptoms (n=40), headache (n=38), and muscle pain (n=35). Most patients were moderately to severely impaired in daily live with a median Bell disability score of 50 (range 15-90) of 100 (healthy) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical function score of 63 (range 15-80) of 100. 19 of 42 patients fulfilled the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These patients reported more fatigue in the Chalder Fatigue Score (p=0.006), more stress intolerance (p=0.042) and more frequent and longer post exertional malaise (PEM) (p=0.003), and hypersensitivity to noise (p=0.029), light (p=0.0143) and temperature (p=0.024) compared to patients not meeting ME/CFS criteria.

245,Dynamics of neutralizing antibody responses in acute-phase COVID-19: A potential relationship between disease progression and rapid neutralizing antibody response,"IntroductionAdaptive immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics remain largely unknown. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are helpful for understanding the pathology.

Patients and MethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, serum sample neutralization values in symptomatic COVID-19 patients were measured using the chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT). At least two sequential serum samples collected during hospitalization were analyzed to assess NAbs neutralizing activity dynamics at different time points.

ResultsOf the 11 patients, four (36.4%), six (54.5%), and one (9.1%) had moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Fifty percent neutralization (N50%-CRNT) was observed upon admission in 90.9% (10/11); all patients acquired neutralizing activity 2-12 days after onset. In patients with moderate disease, neutralization was observed at earliest within two days after symptom onset. In patients with severe-to-critical disease, neutralization activity increased, plateauing 9-16 days after onset. Neutralization activity on admission was significantly higher in patients with moderate disease than in patients with severe-to-critical disease (relative % of infectivity, 6.4% vs. 41.1%; P=.0011).

246,The impact of mobility network properties on predicted epidemic dynamics in Dhaka and Bangkok,"1Properties of city-level commuting networks are expected to influence epidemic potential of cities and modify the speed and spatial trajectory of epidemics when they occur. In this study, we use aggregated mobile phone user data to reconstruct commuter mobility networks for Bangkok (Thailand) and Dhaka (Bangladesh), two megacities in Asia with populations of 16 and 21 million people, respectively. We model the dynamics of directly-transmitted infections (such as SARS-CoV2) propagating on these commuting networks, and find that differences in network structure between the two cities drive divergent predicted epidemic trajectories: the commuting network in Bangkok is composed of geographically-contiguous modular communities and epidemic dispersal is correlated with geographic distance between locations, whereas the network in Dhaka has less distinct geographic structure and epidemic dispersal is less constrained by geographic distance. We also find that the predicted dynamics of epidemics vary depending on the local topology of the network around the origin of the outbreak. Measuring commuter mobility, and understanding how commuting networks shape epidemic dynamics at the city level, can support surveillance and preparedness efforts in large cities at risk for emerging or imported epidemics.",Tyler S Brown; Kenth Engø-Monsen; Mathew V Kiang; Ayesha S Mahmud; Richard J Maude; Caroline O Buckee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21250586,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21250586,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
247,"COVIDHunter: An Accurate, Flexible, and Environment-Aware Open-Source COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model","MotivationEarly detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID-19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation measures.

ResultsUsing Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average of 23.8 x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

Whether pre-pandemic measures of cognition are related to COVID-19 mortality is untested.

MethodsUK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when a reaction time test was administered to the full sample, and verbal-numeric reasoning assessed in a subgroup. Death from COVID-19 was ascertained from participant linkage to a UK-wide national registry.

ResultsBetween April 1st and September 23rd 2020, there were 388 deaths (138 women) ascribed to COVID-19 in the 494,932 individuals (269,602 women) with a reaction time test result, and 125 such deaths (38 women) in the 180,198 (97,794 women) for whom there were data on verbal-numeric reasoning. In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, a one standard deviation (118.2 msec) slower reaction time was related to a higher rate of death from COVID-19 (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval: 1.18; 1.09, 1.28). A one standard deviation disadvantage (2.16 point) on the verbal-numeric reasoning test was also associated with an elevated risk of death (1.32; 1.09, 1.59). Attenuation after adjustment for additional covariates followed a similar pattern for both measures of cognition. For verbal-numeric reasoning, for instance, the hazard ratios were 1.22 (0.98, 1.51) after control for socioeconomic status, 1.16 (0.96, 1.41) after lifestyle factors, 1.25 (1.04, 1.52) after co-morbidity, and 1.29 (1.01, 1.64) after physiological indices.

250,Social predictors of food insecurity during the stay-at-home order due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Results from a cross-sectional web-based survey,"BackgroundStay-at-home orders and social distancing have been implemented as the primary tool to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this approach has indirectly caused, only in Lima-Peru, more than 2{middle dot}3 million Peruvians to lose their jobs. As a result, the risk of food insecurity may have increased in affected low-income families, especially those that depend on daily income. This study estimates the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity (MSFI) and identifies the associated factors that explain this outcome during the stay-at-home order.

MethodsA cross-sectional web-based survey, with the non-probability sample, was conducted between May 18 and June 30, 2020, during the stay-at-home order in Peru. We used social media advertisements on Facebook to reach 18-59 year-olds living in Peru. MSFI was assessed using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Rasch model methodology requirements were considered, and factors associated with MSFI were selected using a stepwise forward selection. A Poisson generalized linear model (Poisson GLMs), with log link function, was employed to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR).

FindingsThis analysis is based on 1846 replies. The prevalence of MSFI was 23{middle dot}2%, and FIES proved to be an acceptable instrument with reliability 0{middle dot}72 and infit 0{middle dot}8-1{middle dot}3. People more likely to experience MSFI were those with low income (less than 255 US$/month) in the pre-pandemic period (aPR 3{middle dot}77; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}98-7{middle dot}16), those whose income was significantly reduced during the pandemic period (aPR 2{middle dot}27; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}55-3{middle dot}31), and those whose savings ran out in less than 21 days (aPR 1{middle dot}86; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}43-2{middle dot}42).

Additionally, those who perceived losing weight during the pandemic (aPR 1{middle dot}21; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}01-1{middle dot}45), and reported increases in processed foods prices (aPR 1{middle dot}31; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}08-1{middle dot}59), and eating less minimally processed food (aPR 1{middle dot}82; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}48-2{middle dot}24) were also more likely to experience MSFI.

InterpretationPeople most at risk of MSFI were those in a critical economic situation before and during the pandemic period. It is necessary to reinforce social protection policies to prevent or mitigate these adverse effects.

251,Sero-surveillance for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 at antenatal care clinics in two Kenyan referral hospitals,"The high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that remain undetected presents a challenge to tracking the progress of the pandemic and implementing control measures in Kenya. We determined the prevalence of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in residual blood samples from mothers attending antenatal care services at 2 referral hospitals in Kenya. We used a validated IgG ELISA for SARS-Cov-2 spike protein and adjusted the results for assay sensitivity and specificity. In Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, seroprevalence in August 2020 was 49.9% (95% CI 42.7-58.0). In Kilifi County Hospital seroprevalence increased from 1.3% (95% CI 0.04-4.7) in September to 11.0% (95% CI 6.2-16.7) in November 2020.

The UK Biobank prospective cohort study comprises around half a million people who were aged 40-69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on ethnic background and potential explanatory factors was captured. Study members were linked to a national mortality registry. In an analytical sample of 448,664 individuals (248,820 women), 354 deaths were ascribed to COVID-19 between 5th March and the end of follow-up on 17th September 2020. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, relative to White participants, Black study members experienced around seven times the risk of COVID-19 mortality (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 7.25; 4.65, 11.33), while there was a doubling in the Asian group (1.98; 1.02, 3.84). Controlling for baseline comorbidities, socioeconomic circumstances, and lifestyle factors explained 53% of the differential in risk for Asian people (1.37; 0.68, 2.77) and 27% in Black study members (4.28; 2.67, 6.86).

The molecular mechanisms causing COVID-19-induced ARDS have yet to be defined, though many studies have documented an increase in cytokines known as a ""cytokine storm."" Here, we demonstrate that cytokines that activate the NF-kappaB pathway can induce Activin A and its downstream marker, FLRG. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients elevated Activin A/FLRG at baseline were predictive of the most severe longitudinal outcomes of COVID-19, including the need for mechanical ventilation, lack of clinical improvement and all-cause mortality. Patients with Activin A/FLRG above the sample median were 2.6/2.9 times more likely to die, relative to patients with levels below the sample median, respectively.

254,Neural epidermal growth factor-like 1 protein variant increases survival and modulates the inflammatory and immune responses in human ACE-2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is a worsening global pandemic. COVID-19 has caused at least 1.7 million deaths worldwide and over 300,000 in the United States. Recently, two promising vaccines are being administered in several countries. However, there remains an urgent need for a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory damage that can lead to intensive care, prolonged hospitalization, or mortality. Moreover, an increasing population of patients manifest lingering disabling symptoms (called Long Haulers). Here, we tested the efficacy of a recombinant neural epidermal growth factor like 1 protein variant (NELL1-NV1) in a COVID-19 mouse model, transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (tg-mice hACE2) infected with SARS-CoV-2. The administration of NELL1-NV1 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 significantly improved clinical health score and increased survival. Analyses of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid demonstrated decreased levels of several cytokines and chemokines (IFN-{gamma}, IL-10, IL-12 p70, CXCL-10/IP-10, MIG and Rantes), in NV1-treated treated mice compared to controls. Cytokines including IL-1, IL-9, IL-6, LIX/CXCL5, KC/CXCL1, MIP-2/CXCL2, MIP-1/CCL3, and G-CSF, critical to immune responses such as neutrophil recruitment, viral clearance and vascularization, were increased compared to controls.

255,Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States,"As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.",Nicole L.

256,"Neutralization of viruses with European, South African, and United States SARS-CoV-2 variant spike proteins by convalescent sera and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies","The increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein has raised concerns that recovered individuals may not be protected from reinfection and that current vaccines will become less effective. The B.1.1.7 isolate identified in the United Kingdom and B.1.351 isolate identified in the Republic of South Africa encode spike proteins with multiple mutations in the S1 and S2 subunits. In addition, variants have been identified in Columbus, Ohio (COH.20G/677H), Europe (20A.EU2) and in domesticated minks. Analysis by antibody neutralization of pseudotyped viruses showed that convalescent sera from patients infected prior to the emergence of the variant viruses neutralized viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, COH.20G/677H Columbus Ohio, 20A.EU2 Europe and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor decrease in titer compared to that of the earlier D614G spike protein. Serum specimens from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine neutralized D614G virus with titers that were on average 7-fold greater than convalescent sera. Vaccine elicited antibodies neutralized virus with the B.1.1.7 spike protein with titers similar to D614G virus and neutralized virus with the B.1.351 spike with, on average, a 3-fold reduction in titer (1:500), a titer that was still higher than the average titer with which convalescent sera neutralized D614G (1:139). The reduction in titer was attributable to the E484K mutation in the RBD. The B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses were not more infectious than D614G on ACE2.293T cells in vitro but N501Y, an ACE2 contacting residue present in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and COH.20G/677H spike proteins caused higher affinity binding to ACE2, likely contributing to their increased transmissibility. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by primary infection and by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are likely to maintain protective efficacy against B.1.1.7 and most other variants but that the partial resistance of virus with the B.1.351 spike protein could render some individuals less well protected, supporting a rationale for the development of modified vaccines containing E484K.",Takuya Tada; Belinda M Dcosta; Marie Samanovic-Golden; Ramin S Herati; Amber Cornelius; Mark J Mulligan; Nathaniel R Landau,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.430003,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.430003,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False

Furthermore, JMB2002 has demonstrated complete prophylactic and potent therapeutic efficacy in a rhesus macaque disease model.

259,Targeting CTP Synthetase 1 to Restore Interferon Induction and Impede Nucleotide Synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with astonishing mortality and morbidity. The mechanisms underpinning its highly infectious nature remain poorly understood. We report here that SARS-CoV-2 exploits cellular CTP synthetase 1 (CTPS1) to promote CTP synthesis and suppress interferon (IFN) induction. Screening a SARS-CoV-2 expression library identified ORF7b and ORF8 that suppressed IFN induction via inducing the deamidation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Deamidated IRF3 fails to bind the promoters of classic IRF3-responsible genes, thus muting IFN induction. Conversely, a shRNA-mediated screen focused on cellular glutamine amidotransferases corroborated that CTPS1 deamidates IRF3 to inhibit IFN induction. Functionally, ORF7b and ORF8 activate CTPS1 to promote de novo CTP synthesis while shutting down IFN induction. De novo synthesis of small-molecule inhibitors of CTPS1 enabled CTP depletion and IFN induction in SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus impeding SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our work uncovers a strategy that a viral pathogen couples immune evasion to metabolic activation to fuel viral replication.

Understanding protein rearrangement and identifying specific residues where mutations affect protein rearrangement has attracted a lot of attention for drug development. We use a mathematical method introduced in [9] to associate a local topological/geometrical free energy along the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein backbone. Our results show that the total local topological free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monotonically decreases from pre-to post-fusion and that its distribution along the protein domains is related to their activity in protein rearrangement. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with inclusion of solvent effects, we show that high local topological free energy conformations are unstable compared to those of low topological free energy. By comparing to experimental data, we find that the high local topological free energy conformations in the spike protein are associated with mutations which have the largest experimentally observed effect to protein rearrangement.",Quenisha Baldwin; Bobby G Sumpter; Eleni Panagiotou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430094,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430094,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
261,Insights on SARS-CoV-2's Mutations for Evading Human Antibodies: Sacrifice and Survival,"Recent mutations on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2s spike protein have been manifested as the major cause of the wide and rapid spread of the virus. Especially, the variant B.1.351 in South Africa with the hallmark of triple mutations (N501Y, K417N and E484K) is worrisome. Quickly after the outbreak of this new variant, several studies showed that both N501Y and E484K can enhance the binding between RBD and the human ACE2 receptor. However, the mutation K417N seems to be unfavorable because it removes one interfacial salt-bridge. So far, it is still not well understood why the K417N mutation is selected in the viral evolution. Here, we show that despite the loss in the binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2 the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt-bridge between RBD and the neutralizing antibody CB6 and thus substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, facilitating the variants to efficiently elude CB6 (as well as many other antibodies). Thus, when proliferating from person to person the virus might have adapted to the human immune system through evasive mutations. Taking into account limited and relevant experimental works in the field, we show that our theoretical predictions are consistent with existing experimental findings. By harnessing the revealed molecular mechanism for variants, it becomes feasible to redesign therapeutic antibodies accordingly to make them more efficacious.

There is no doubt that fully simulating the advanced structure of this homotrimer in the subunit vaccine development strategy is the most likely way to improve the immune protective effect of the vaccine. In this study, the preparation strategies of S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) trimer, S1 region trimer, and ectodomain (ECD) trimer nanoparticles were designed based on ferritin nanoparticle self-assembly technology. The Bombyx mori baculovirus expression system was used to prepare these three nanoparticle vaccines with high expression levels in the silkworm. The immune results of mice show that the nanoparticle vaccine prepared by this strategy can not only induce an immune response by subcutaneous administration but also effective by oral administration. Given the stability of these ferritin-based nanoparticles vaccine, easy-to-use and low-cost oral immunization strategy can make up for the vaccination blind areas caused by the shortage of ultralow-temperature equipment and medical resources in underdeveloped areas.

263,"Assessing knowledge, concerns, and risk perceptions among Italian medical students during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","INTRODUCTIONDuring the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic, Italian medical students transitioned from in-person to remote learning. This study was carried out to early assess students sources of information, perceived risk of infection, knowledge and preventive practices in order to resume academic activity. The impact of training and volunteer work was also assessed.

METHODSA cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2020 among medical students enrolled in the School of Medicine and Surgery, Bologna University.

RESULTSThe analysis included 537 responses. On average students used seven sources of information on COVID-19. Scientific journals were considered the most trustworthy but they ranked only 6th in the frequency of use. Perceived risk of infection was higher for academic activities, especially in the hospital than daily living activities. Less than 50% of students reported being trained on biological risk and use of PPE. Training received was significantly associated with both perceived risk of infection and confidence in the use of PPE. Students engaged in volunteer work had higher confidence in PPE usage.

DISCUSSIONAccessible scientific information and students engagement in spreading correct knowledge play an important role in challenging misinformation during the pandemic crisis. Students showed suboptimal knowledge about PPE use, calling for additional training. We found a moderate-high perceived risk of infection that could be mitigated with specific educational programs and by promoting voluntary work. Students engagement in public health emergencies (PHE) could potentially be beneficial for their training and as well as for the healthcare system.",Manfredi Greco; Elisa Maietti; Elena Savoia; Davide Trere; Chiara Reno; Flavia Rallo; Maria Pia Fantini; DAVIDE GORI,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250922,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
264,"Was R<1 before the English lockdowns? On modelling mechanistic detail, causality and inference about Covid-19","Detail is a double edged sword in epidemiological modelling. The inclusion of mechanistic detail in models of highly complex systems has the potential to increase realism, but it also increases the number of modelling assumptions, which become harder to check as their possible interactions multiply. Knock et al. (2020) fit an age structured SEIR model with added health service compartments to data on deaths, hospitalization and test results from Covid-19 in seven English regions for the period March to December 2020. The simplest version of the model has 684 states per region. One main conclusion is that only full lockdowns brought the pathogen reproduction number, R, below one, with R >> 1 in all regions on the eve of March 2020 lockdown. We critically evaluate the Knock et al. epidemiological model, and the semi-causal conclusions made using it, based on an independent reimplementation of the model designed to allow relaxation of some of its strong assumptions. In particular, Knock et al. model the effect on transmission of both non-pharmaceutical interventions and weather using a piecewise linear function, b(t), with 12 breakpoints at selected government announcement or intervention dates. We replace this representation by a smoothing spline with time varying smoothness, thereby allowing the form of b(t) to be substantially more data driven. We conclude that there is no sound basis for using the Knock et al. model and their analysis to make counterfactual statements about the number of deaths that would have occurred with different lockdown timings. However, if fits of this epidemiological model structure are viewed as a reasonable basis for inference about the time course of incidence and R, then without very strong modelling assumptions, the pathogen reproduction number was probably below one, and incidence in substantial decline, some days before either of the first two English national lockdowns. Of course this does not imply that lockdowns had no effect, but it does suggest that other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were much more effective than Knock et al. imply.

265,Symptom Prediction and Mortality Risk Calculation for COVID-19 Using Machine Learning,"BackgroundEarly prediction of symptoms and mortality risks for COVID-19 patients would improve healthcare outcomes, allow for the appropriate distribution of healthcare resources, reduce healthcare costs, aid in vaccine prioritization and self-isolation strategies, and thus reduce the prevalence of the disease. Such publicly accessible prediction models are lacking, however.

MethodsBased on a comprehensive evaluation of existing machine learning (ML) methods, we created two models based solely on the age, gender, and medical histories of 23,749 hospital-confirmed COVID-19 patients from February to September 2020: a symptom prediction model (SPM) and a mortality prediction model (MPM). The SPM predicts 12 symptom groups for each patient: respiratory distress, consciousness disorders, chest pain, paresis or paralysis, cough, fever or chill, gastrointestinal symptoms, sore throat, headache, vertigo, loss of smell or taste, and muscular pain or fatigue. The MPM predicts the death of COVID-19-positive individuals.

ResultsThe SPM yielded ROC-AUCs of 0.53-0.78 for symptoms. The most accurate prediction was for consciousness disorders at a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 70%. 2440 deaths were observed in the study population. MPM had a ROC-AUC of 0.79 and could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 70%. About 90% of deaths occurred in the top 21 percentile of risk groups. To allow patients and clinicians to use these models easily, we created a freely accessible online interface at www.aicovid.org.

ConclusionsThe ML models predict COVID-19-related symptoms and mortality using information that is readily available to patients as well as clinicians. Thus, both can rapidly estimate the severity of the disease, allowing shared and better healthcare decisions with regard to hospitalization, self-isolation strategy, and COVID-19 vaccine prioritization in the coming months.

266,Prioritizing allocation of COVID-19 vaccines based on social contacts increases vaccination effectiveness,"We study allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to individuals based on the structural properties of their underlying social contact network. Even optimistic estimates suggest that most countries will likely take 6 to 24 months to vaccinate their citizens. These time estimates and the emergence of new viral strains urge us to find quick and effective ways to allocate the vaccines and contain the pandemic. While current approaches use combinations of age-based and occupation-based prioritizations, our strategy marks a departure from such largely aggregate vaccine allocation strategies. We propose a novel agent-based modeling approach motivated by recent advances in (i) science of real-world networks that point to efficacy of certain vaccination strategies and (ii) digital technologies that improve our ability to estimate some of these structural properties. Using a realistic representation of a social contact network for the Commonwealth of Virginia, combined with accurate surveillance data on spatio-temporal cases and currently accepted models of within- and between-host disease dynamics, we study how a limited number of vaccine doses can be strategically distributed to individuals to reduce the overall burden of the pandemic. We show that allocation of vaccines based on individuals degree (number of social contacts) and total social proximity time is significantly more effective than the currently used age-based allocation strategy in terms of number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Our results suggest that in just two months, by March 31, 2021, compared to age-based allocation, the proposed degree-based strategy can result in reducing an additional 56-110k infections, 3.2-5.4k hospitalizations, and 700-900 deaths just in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Extrapolating these results for the entire US, this strategy can lead to 3-6 million fewer infections, 181-306k fewer hospitalizations, and 51-62k fewer deaths compared to age-based allocation. The overall strategy is robust even: (i) if the social contacts are not estimated correctly; (ii) if the vaccine efficacy is lower than expected or only a single dose is given; (iii) if there is a delay in vaccine production and deployment; and (iv) whether or not non-pharmaceutical interventions continue as vaccines are deployed. For reasons of implementability, we have used degree, which is a simple structural measure and can be easily estimated using several methods, including the digital technology available today. These results are significant, especially for resource-poor countries, where vaccines are less available, have lower efficacy, and are more slowly distributed.",Jiangzhuo Chen; Stefan Hoops; Achla Marathe; Henning Mortveit; Bryan Lewis; Srinivasan Venkatramanan; Arash Haddadan; Parantapa Bhattacharya; Abhijin Adiga; Anil Vullikanti; Aravind Srinivasan; Mandy Wilson; Gal Ehrlich; Maier Fenster; Stephen Eubank; Christopher Barrett; Madhav Marathe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251012,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251012,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
267,SARS-CoV-2 Worldwide Replication Drives Rapid Rise and Selection of Mutations across the Viral Genome: A Time-Course StudyPotential Challenge for Vaccines and Therapies,"Scientists and the public were alarmed at the first large viral variant of SARS-CoV2 reported in December 2020. We have followed the time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in ten countries on four continents. We examined complete SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID, (Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data) with sampling dates extending until January 20, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, USA, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China. Among the novel mutations, some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased in prevalence over time. VUI2012/01 (B.1.1.7) and 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), the so-called UK and South Africa variants, respectively, and two variants from Brazil, 484K.V2, now called P.1 and P.2, increased in prevalence. Despite lockdowns, worldwide active replication in genetically and socio-economically diverse populations facilitated selection of new mutations. The data on mutant and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains provided here comprise a global resource for easy access to the myriad mutations and variants detected to date globally. Rapidly evolving new variant and mutant strains might give rise to escape variants, capable of limiting the efficacy of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tests.

Significance and New Aspects of Study - SynopsisO_LIWe examine the time course of emerging mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have rapidly been selected in the worlds populations through the beginning of 2021. A study of the prevalence of viral mutations in the GISAID database in ten different countries - United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, US, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China - revealed widespread mutations along the genome.
C_LIO_LIWe previously identified about 10 hotspot mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that became prevalent in many of the countries studied1. Since the beginning of February, many new mutations arose in the ten countries (and worldwide). The preponderance of variants and mutations correlated with the increased spread of Covid-19.
C_LIO_LIThere was a temporal progression from about 10 predominant mutants shared by several countries up to the end of May 2020, followed by a consistent and rapid increase in the number of new mutations between June and December along with the emergence of variants of concern, first reported in December 2020.
C_LIO_LIWe examine the relative frequencies of mutations, along with variants of interest, in 10 countries up until January 20, 2021. Investigations on the pathogenic properties of individual SARS-CoV-2 mutations will be urgently needed to understand the kaleidoscopic patterns of worldwide Covid-19 outbreaks and symptoms. Monitoring the frequency and speed of mutant selection have direct relevance to diagnostic testing, vaccines and therapeutics.
C_LIO_LIAs an explanation for efficient viral mutagenesis, we hypothesize that the viral spike protein - as documented - facilitates viral entry via the cells ACE receptor2. This in turn interacts with the APOBEC polypeptide, an m-RNA editing function. The actually observed frequent C to U (T) transitions and other base exchanges are thus effected. Hence, as one of the earliest steps upon viral entry, active mutagenesis commences, since SARS-CoV-2 exploits one of the cells defenses against viral infections.

268,The systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection: Comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts,"BackgroundIn order to manage the COVID-19 systemic inflammatory response, it is important to identify clinicopathological characteristics across multiple cohorts.

MethodsElectronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17th March 2020 - 1st May 2020) and (cohort 2: 18th May 2020 - 6th July 2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data.

ResultsCompared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). Over the 2 cohorts, age [&ge;]70 (p<0.001), male gender (p<0.05), hypertension (p<0.01), heart failure (p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.001), frailty (p<0.001), COPD (p<0.05), delirium (p<0.001), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p[&le;]0.001), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.01); and the 4C score were associated with 30-day mortality. When compared with the 4C score, greater frailty (OR 10.2, 95% C.I. 3.4 - 30.6, p<0.01) and low albumin (OR 5.6, 95% C.I. 2.0 - 15.6, p<0.01) were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality.

ConclusionIn addition to the 4C mortality score, frailty score and a low albumin were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality in two consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Article summaryO_LIIn two consecutive cohorts of patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to two urban teaching hospitals in Glasgow, UK, there were variations in a number of clinicopathological characteristics despite similar mortality (23 and 22%).
C_LIO_LIIn these two cohorts, in a multivariate analysis that included the 4C mortality score, clinical frailty score >3, low serum albumin concentration (<35 g/L), high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ([&ge;]5), and abnormal serum sodium concentration (<133/>145 mmol/L) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality.

269,Assessing the performance of a serological point-of-care test in measuring detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"ObjectiveTo investigate the performance of a rapid point-of-care antibody test, the BioMedomics COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test, in comparison with a high-quality, validated, laboratory-based platform, the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay.

MethodsSerological testing was conducted on 708 individuals. Concordance metrics were estimated. Logistic regression was used to assess associations with seropositivity.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 63.4% (449/708; 95% CI 59.8%-66.9%) using the BioMedomics assay and 71.9% (509/708; 95% CI 68.5%-75.1%) using the Elecsys assay. There were 62 discordant results between the two assays. One specimen was seropositive in the BioMedomics assay, but seronegative in the Elecsys assay, while 61 specimens were seropositive in the Elecsys assay, but seronegative in the BioMedomics assay. Positive, negative, and overall percent agreements between the two assays were 88.0% (95% CI 84.9%-90.6%), 99.5% (95% CI 97.2%-99.9%), and 91.2% (95% CI 88.9%-93.1%), respectively, with a Cohens kappa of 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83), indicating excellent agreement. Excluding specimens with lower antibody titers, the agreement improved with positive, negative, and overall percent concordance of 91.2% (95% CI 88.2%-93.6%), 99.5% (95% CI 97.2%-99.9%), and 93.9% (95% CI 91.7%-95.5%), respectively, and a Cohens kappa of 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.89). Logistic regression confirmed better agreement with higher antibody titers.

270,"Combination therapy of Tocilizumab and steroid for management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome: A single center experience from Pune, Western India","BackgroundCytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is thought to be the cause of inflammatory lung damage, worsening pneumonia and death in patients with COVID-19. Steroids (Methylprednisolone or Dexamethasone) and Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, are approved for the treatment of CRS in India. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ and steroids in COVID-19 associated CRS.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary level private hospital in Pune, India between 2nd April and 2nd November 2020. All patients administered TCZ and steroids for treatment of CRS were included. The primary endpoint was incidence of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were need for mechanical ventilation and incidence of infectious complications. Baseline and time-dependent risk factors significantly associated with death were identified by Relative risk estimation.

ResultsOut of 2831 admitted patients, 515 (24.3% females) were administered TCZ and steroids. Median age of the cohort was 57 (IQR: 46.5, 66) years. Almost 72 % patients had preexisting co-morbidities. Median time to TCZ administration since onset of symptoms was 9 days (IQR: 7, 11). 63% patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Mechanical ventilation was required in 242 (47%) patients. Of these, 44.2% (107/242) recovered and were weaned off the ventilator. There were 135 deaths (26.2%), while 380 patients (73.8%) had clinical improvement. Infectious complications like hospital acquired pneumonia, bloodstream bacterial and fungal infections were observed in 2.13 %, 2.13 % and 0.06 % patients respectively. Age [&ge;] 60 years (p=0.014), presence of co-morbidities like hypertension (p = 0.011), IL-6 [&ge;] 100 pg/ml (p = 0.002), D-dimer [&ge;] 1000 ng/ml (p < 0.0001), CT severity index [&ge;] 18 (p < 0.0001) and systemic complications like lung fibrosis (p = 0.019), cardiac arrhythmia (p < 0.0001), hypotension (p < 0.0001) and encephalopathy (p < 0.0001) were associated with increased risk of death.

271,Subgenomic RNAs as molecular indicators of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,"In coronaviridae such as SARS-CoV-2, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) are replicative intermediates, therefore, their abundance and structures could infer viral replication activity and severity of host infection. Here, we systematically characterized the sgRNA expression and their structural variation in 81 clinical specimens collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with a goal of assessing viral genomic signatures of disease severity. We demonstrated the highly coordinated and consistent expression of sgRNAs from individuals with robust infections that results in symptoms, and found their expression is significantly repressed in the asymptomatic infections, indicating that the ratio of sgRNAs to genomic RNA (sgRNA/gRNA) is highly correlated with the severity of the disease. Using long read sequencing technologies to characterize full-length sgRNA structures, we also observed widespread deletions in viral RNAs, and identified unique sets of deletions preferentially found primarily in symptomatic individuals, with many likely to confer changes in SARS-CoV-2 virulence and host responses. Furthermore, based on the sgRNA structures, the frequently occurred structural variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes serves as a mechanism to further induce SARS-CoV-2 proteome complexity. Taken together, our results show that differential sgRNA expression and structural mutational burden both appear to be correlated with the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

272,Exponential increase in neutralizing and spike specific antibodies following vaccination of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors,"BackgroundWith the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines, recovered COVID-19 subjects who are vaccinated may be ideal candidates to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP).

Case SeriesThree recovered COVID-19 patients were screened to donate CCP. All had molecularly confirmed COVID-19, and all were antibody positive by chemiluminescence immunoassay (DiaSorin) prior to vaccination. All were tested again for antibodies 11 to 21 days after they received the first dose of the vaccine (Pfizer). All showed dramatic increases ([~]50 fold) in spike-specific antibody levels and had at least a 20-fold increase in the IC50 neutralizing antibody titer based on plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT). The spike-specific antibody levels following vaccination were significantly higher than those seen in any non-vaccinated COVID-19 subjects tested to date at our facility.

ConclusionSpike-specific and neutralizing antibodies demonstrated dramatic increases following a single vaccination post COVID-19 infection which significantly exceeded values seen with COVID-19 infection alone.

Materials and MethodsA randomized clinical trial (Trial registration # NCT04392713) was carried out at Combined Military Hospital Lahore from March 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Eighty-six patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) proven SARS-CoV-2 infection completed the trial protocol. Patients were stratified via the lottery method into two groups. Group A was administered standard of care (SOC) treatment as per existing hospital guidelines whereas group B was given ivermectin (single dose of 12 milligrams) along with SOC treatment. PCR was repeated at 72 hours, 7th day, and at 14th day of admission for both the groups and the point at which the PCR became negative was noted. Complete blood counts, liver function tests and renal function tests were done at recruitment, 7th day, and 14th day. The primary outcome was the viral clearance, measured as days to achieve PCR negativity. The secondary outcome was the development of any adverse side effects pertinent to ivermectin or derangement in baseline laboratory parameters.

ResultsIn group A, 36 (80%) participants were males, and 9 (20%) were females, whereas in group B, 37 (90.2%) were males and 4 (9.8%) were females. Mean age was 39.0{+/-} 12.6 and 42.2 {+/-} 12.0 years for groups A and B, respectively (p= 0.394). There was early viral clearance in group B as compared to group A (p=0.001).

275,"Could the new COVID-19 mutant strain undermine vaccination efforts? A mathematical modelling approach for estimating the spread of the UK mutant strain using Ontario, Canada, as a case study","BackgroundInfections represent highly dynamic processes, characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents, viruses, such as the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to takeover a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study, but the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogens.

Methods and findingsWe devise a two-strain mathematical framework, to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain is unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. Current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will mostly likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to have an immune population by end of 2021.

ConclusionsOur findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy-and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease.",Matthew Betti; Nicola Bragazzi; Jane Marie Heffernan; Jude Dzevela Kong; Angie Raad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251039,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251039,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

We sought to characterise the heterogeneity of R0 across known outbreaks within these facilities. We used a unique comprehensive dataset of all outbreaks that have occurred within LTHC facilities in British Columbia, Canada. We estimated R0 with a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic model of susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals, that incorporates heterogeneity of R0 between facilities. We further compared these estimates to those obtained with standard methods that utilize the exponential growth rate and maximum likelihood. The total size of an outbreak varied dramatically, with a range of attack rates of 2%-86%. The Bayesian analysis provides more constrained overall estimates of R0 = 2.83 (90% CrI [credible interval] 0.25- 7.19) than standard methods, with a range within facilities of 0.66-10.06.

Symptoms were more common among caregivers who were young vs older adults (e.g., aged 18-24 vs [&ge;]65 years, aPR 2.75, 95% CI 1.95-3.88, p<0.0001), Hispanic or Latino vs non-Hispanic White (1.14, 1.04-1.25, p=0.0044), living with vs without disabilities (1.18, 1.10-1.26, p<0.0001), and with moderate and high vs low Caregiver Intensity Index scores (2.31, 1.65-3.23; 2.81, 2.00-3.94; both p<0.0001). Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White caregivers (1.48, 1.15-1.90, p=0.0022).

ConclusionsCaregivers, who accounted for one in four US adult respondents in this nationally representative sample, more commonly reported adverse mental health symptoms than non-caregivers. Increased visibility of and access to mental health care resources are urgently needed to address mental health challenges of caregiving.",Mark É Czeisler; Alexandra Drane; Sarah S. Winnay; Emily R.

278,Estimating vaccine confidence levels among future healthcare workers and their trainers: A quantitative study protocol,"IntroductionThe outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caught the world off guard in the first quarter of the year 2020. To stem the tide of this pandemic, the development, testing, and pre-licensure approval for emergency use of some COVID 19 vaccine candidates were accelerated. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy which was already declared one of the top ten threats to global health in the year 2019. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a skeptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs becomes critical to the success of vaccination endeavors, especially COVID 19 vaccination. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID 19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention.

Methods and analysisAn online survey will be distributed to current staff and students of an academic institution for HCWs. The survey questionnaire will consist of a demographic questions section consisting of six items and a vaccine confidence section comprising six items in Likert scale format.

A multinomial logistic regression model will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. Statistical significance will be defined at a p-value <0.05.

Ethics and disseminationEthics approval has been obtained for the study from Stellenbosch University (HREC Reference # S19/01/014 (PhD)). The results will be shared with relevant health authorities, presented at conferences, and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

279,HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY INFECTION BY COVID-19: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL,"The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) represents a major public health problem due to its rapid spread and its ability to generate severe pneumonia. Thus, it is essential to find a treatment that reduces mortality. Our objective was to estimate whether treatment with 400 mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine for 10 days reduces in-hospital mortality in subjects with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 compared with placebo.

Material and methodsA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe disease by COVID-19 through an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible for the study were adults aged more than 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and lung injury requiring hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: days of mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events.

ResultsA total of 214 patients with COVID-19 were recruited, randomized and analyzed. They were hypoxemic with a mean SpO2 of 65% {+/-} 20, tachycardic (pulse rate 108{+/-}17 min-1) and tachypneic (32 {+/-}10 min-1); 162 were under mechanical ventilation at randomization. Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups (38% in Hydroxychloroquine vs. 41% in placebo, hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.51-1.53). In the surviving participants, no significant difference was found in secondary outcomes.

ConclusionNo beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of Hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

280,Protocol for a nationwide Internet-based health survey in workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,"The ever-changing social implications of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in an urgent need to understand the working environments and health status of workers. We conducted a nationwide Internet-based health survey in Japanese workers in December 2020, in the midst the countrys ""third wave"" of COVID-19 infection. Of 33,087 surveys collected, 6,051 were determined to have invalid responses. The 27,036 surveys included in the study were balanced in terms of geographical area, participant sex, and type of work, according to the sampling plan. Men were more likely than women to have telecommuted, while women were more likely to have resigned since April 2020. Moreover, 40% and 9.1% of respondents had a K6 score of 5 or higher and 13 or higher, respectively, they did not exhibit extremely poor health. The present study describes the protocol used to conduct an Internet-based health survey in workers and a summary of its results during a period when COVID-19 was spreading rapidly in Japan. In the future, we plan to use this survey to examine the impact of COVID-19 on workers work styles and health.",Yoshihisa Fujino; Tomohiro Ishimaru; Hisashi Eguchi; Mayumi Tsuji; Seiichiro Tateishi; Akira Ogami; Koji Mori; Shinya Matsuda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21249309,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21249309,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
281,Impact of personal protective equipment use on health care workers physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in high-risk clinical settings have been obliged to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

AimTo assess the impact of PPE use on HCWs physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, we examined factors related with a greater risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use.

MethodsWe applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the Cochrane criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL and pre-print services (medRxiv) from January 1, 2020 to December 27, 2020.

FindingsOur review included 14 studies with 11,746 HCWs from 16 countries. The estimated overall prevalence of adverse events among HCWs was 78% (95% CI: 66.7-87.5%) with a range from 42.8% to 95.1% among studies. The prevalence of adverse events was higher for the studies with poor quality compared to those with moderate quality (83.5% vs. 67.1%), while increased sample size was related with decreased prevalence (p<0.001). The most frequent adverse events were headache (55.9%), dry skin (54.4%), dyspnoea (53.4%), pressure injuries (40.4%), itching (39.8%), hyperhidrosis (38.5%), and dermatitis (31.0%). Among others, the following factors were related with the risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use: female gender, younger age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, smoking pre-existing headache, longer duration of shifts wearing PPE, increased consecutive days with PPE, and increased exposure to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionThe frequency of adverse events amongst HCWs due to PPE use is very high. Further studies should be conducted since the limitations of this review do not allow us to infer conclusive results especially in case of risk factors for the occurrence of adverse events. Healthcare facilities should take the necessary precautions and change the working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent adverse events associated with PPE use and minimize harm to HCWs.",Petros A Galanis; Irene Vraka; Despoina Fragkou; Angeliki Bilali; Daphne Kaitelidou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251056,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251056,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

We investigated the psychological impact of healthcare workers during novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV times in Morocco.

A cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare workers of an University Hospital. We evaluated the knowledge of the protective means against nCov-19, incidence and the degree of anxiety and depression according to health workers characteristic.

Among 287 health workers; 54% have been trained regarding protection procedures, and 94.8% declared that they are aware of individual protection measures. The incidence of anxiety and depression was respectively 77.4% and 73.9%. High degree of anxiety and depression was associated with female gender.

283,"Association between Median Household Income, State Medicaid Expansion Status, and COVID-19 Outcomes Across US Counties","ObjectiveThe relationship between socioeconomic status and its interaction with States Medicaid-expansion policies on COVID-19 outcomes across United States (US) counties are uncertain. To determine the association between median-household-income and its interaction with State Medicaid-expansion status on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties

MethodsLongitudinal, retrospective analysis of 3142 US counties (including District of Columbia) to study the relationship between County-level median-household-income (defined by US Census Bureaus Small-Area-Income-and-Poverty-Estimates) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality per 100000 of the population in US counties from January 20, 2020 through December 6, 2020. County median-household-income was log-transformed and stratified by quartiles. Medicaid-expansion status was defined by US States Medicaid-expansion adoption as of first reported US COVID-19 infection, January 20, 2020. Multilevel mixed-effects generalized-linear-model with negative binomial distribution and log link function compared quartiles of median-household-income and COVID-19 incidence and mortality, reported as incidence-risk-ratio (IRR) and mortality-risk-ratio (MRR), respectively. Models adjusted for county socio-demographic and comorbidity conditions, population density, and hospitals, with a random intercept for states. Multiplicative interaction tested for Medicaid-expansion*income quartiles on COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

ResultsThere was no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence across counties by income quartiles or by Medicaid expansion status. Conversely, significant differences exist between COVID-19 mortality by income quartiles and by Medicaid expansion status. The association between income quartiles and COVID-19 mortality was significant only in counties from non-Medicaid-expansion states but not significant in counties from Medicaid-expansion states (P<0.01 for interaction). For non-Medicaid-expansion states, counties in the lowest income quartile had a 41% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared to counties in the highest income quartile (MRR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.25-1.59).

Conclusions and RelevanceMedian-household-income was not related to COVID-19 incidence but negatively related to COVID-19 mortality in US counties of states without Medicaid-expansion. It was unrelated to COVID-19 mortality in counties of states that adopted Medicaid-expansion. These findings suggest that expanded healthcare coverage should be investigated further to attenuate the excessive COVID-19 mortality risk associated with low-income communities.

Key FindingsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there a relationship between COVID-19 outcomes (incidence and mortality) and household income and status of Medicaid expansion of US counties?

FindingsIn this longitudinal, retrospective analysis of 3142 US counties, we found no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence across US counties by quartiles of household income. However, counties with lower median household income had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, but only in non-Medicaid expansion states. This relationship was not significant in Medicaid expansion states.

284,Impact of Vaccination and Testing in an Urban Campus model for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"The crisis induced by the Coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted educational institutes. Even with vaccination efforts underway, it is not clear that sufficient confidence will be achieved for schools to reopen soon.

This paper considers the impact of vaccination rates and testing rates to reduce infections and hospitalizations and evaluates strategies that will allow educational institute in urban settings to reopen. These strategies are also applicable to businesses and would help plan reopening in order to help the economy.

Our analysis is based on a graph model where nodes represent population groups and edges represent population exchanges due to commuting populations. The commuting population is associated with edges and is associated with one of the end nodes of the edge during part of the time period and with the other node during the remainder of the time period. The progression of the disease at each node is determined via compartment models, that include vaccination rates and testing to place infected people in quarantine along with consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. Applying this to a university population in Chicago with a substantial commuter population, chosen to be 80% as an illustration, provides an analysis which specifies benefits of testing and vaccination strategies over a time period of 150 days.",Sanjiv Kapoor; Yi Zhang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251040,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251040,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
285,Age-related heterogeneity in Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following BNT162b2 vaccination,"BackgroundVaccines remain the cornerstone for containing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. mRNA vaccines provide protection in clinical trials using a two-dose approach, separated by a three to four week gap. UK policy in 2021 is to extend the dosing interval from three to twelve weeks. There is a paucity of data in the elderly, even though these individuals are the first to receive vaccines due to risk of severe disease. Here we assessed real world immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2.

MethodsWe did a prospective cohort study of individuals presenting for first dose vaccination. Following the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, we measured IFN{gamma} T cell responses, as well as binding antibody (IgA, IgG and IgG1-4) responses to Spike and Spike RBD. We also measured neutralising antibody responses to Spike in sera using a lentiviral pseudotyping system. We correlated age with immune responses and compared responses after the first and second doses.

FindingsMedian age was 63.5 years amongst 42 participants. Three weeks after the first dose a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved adequate neutralisation titre of >1:20 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 (8/17 versus 19/24, p=0.03). Geometric mean neutralisation titres in this age group after the first dose were lower than in younger individuals (p<0.001). Binding IgA and IgG1 and 3 responses developed post vaccination, as observed in natural infection. T-cell responses were not different in those above or below 80 years. Following the second dose, 50% neutralising antibody titres were above 1:20 in all individuals and there was no longer a difference by age grouping.

InterpretationA high proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have suboptimal neutralising antibody responses following first dose vaccination with BNT162b2, cautioning against extending the dosing interval in this high risk population.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles published from June 1st 2020 until February 8th 2021. We limited our search to English language papers. We used the following terms: ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""vaccine"" OR ""BNT162b2"" OR ""Pfizer/BioNTech"". We identified only one paper. It showed lower neutralising antibody responses following the first dose of BNT162b in a small group of 12 individuals over 65 compared to those under 65. There were no data for patients above 82 years of age and no data on T cell responses by age. We did not find pre-prints on age related heterogeneity in individuals immunised with the Pfizer/BioNtech mRNA vaccine.

What this study addsWe show real world immune responses in forty two individuals to BNT162b2, spanning both T and B cell arms. We show that a high proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have suboptimal neutralising antibody responses following first dose vaccination with BNT162b2. The second dose generates robust responses in these poor responders. We quantify SARS-CoV-2 Spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) IgA and IgG isotypes as well as IgG subclasses. Finally we show that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are robustly induced by first dose vaccination and are not impacted by age.

286,Risk Factors for Infection and Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Autoimmune Diseases,"BackgroundPeople with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions who take immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have a higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences.

ObjectiveAssess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterize pandemic-associated changes to care.

DesignLongitudinal registry study

Participants4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins

MeasurementsPeriodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare

ResultsA total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Pandemic-related disruption to care was common. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions. Individuals experiencing changes to employment or income were at highest odds of care disruption.

LimitationsResults may not be generalizable to all patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Information was self-reported.

287,Increased SAR-CoV-2 shedding associated with reduced disease severity despite continually emerging genetic variants,"Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, genetic variants have continued to emerge, complicating strategies for mitigating the disease burden of COVID-19. Positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs (n=8,735) were collected from Missouri, USA, from March-October 2020, and viral genomes (n=178) were sequenced. Hospitalization status and length of stay were extracted from medical charts of 1,335 patients and integrated with emerging genetic variants and viral shedding analyses for assessment of clinical impacts. Multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Missouri, primarily from Australia, Europe, and domestic states, were observed. Four local lineages rapidly emerged and spread across urban and rural regions in Missouri. While the majority of Missouri viruses harbored Spike-D614G mutations, a large number of unreported mutations were identified among Missouri viruses, including seven in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex and Spike protein that were positively selected. A 15.6-fold increase in viral RNA levels in swab samples occurred from March to May and remained elevated. Accounting for other comorbidities, individuals test-positive for COVID-19 with high viral loads were less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.20, 0.77) and had shorter hospital stays (hazard ratio=0.34, p=0.003) than those with low viral loads. Overall, the first eight months of the pandemic in Missouri saw multiple locally acquired mutants emerge and dominate in urban and rural locations. Although we were unable to find associations between specific variants and greater disease severity, Missouri COVID-positive individuals that presented with increased viral shedding had less severe disease by several measures.",Cynthia Y Tang; Yang Wang; Cheng Gao; David R Smith; Jane A McElroy; Tao Li; Karen Segovia; Tricia Haynes; Richard Hammer; Christopher Sampson; Detlef Ritter; Christopher Schulze; Robin Trotman; Grace M Lidl; Richard Webby; Jun Hang; Xiu-Feng Wan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250928,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250928,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
288,Antibody responses boosted in seropositive healthcare workers after single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine,"Current guidelines recommend that individuals who have had COVID-19 should receive the identical vaccine regimen as those who have not had the infection. This includes two doses of the mRNA platform vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer; mRNA-1273/Moderna) that are approved for use in the United States. In this brief report, we show that after a single dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, individuals that had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly higher antibody levels than individuals that had no history of infection. This provides the rationale for changing vaccination policy to deliver only a single dose to individuals with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection that may free up additional doses for individuals that have no preexisting immunity to the virus. Future study of other immune parameters such as T cell response and durability of immune response should be rapidly undertaken in individuals that had COVID-19 prior to vaccination.",Todd Bradley; - CODIEFY study team; Elin Grundberg; Rangaraj Selvarangan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251078,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251078,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

While there is evidence for autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we established a prospective observational cohort to study lung specific autoantibodies (auto-Abs). Incubation of plasma from severe COVID-19 patients with healthy human lung tissue revealed the presence of IgA antibodies binding to surfactant-producing pneumocytes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and protein pull-downs using porcine surfactant confirmed the presence of auto-Abs binding to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Mass spectrometry and ELISAs with recombinant proteins identified IgA auto-Abs that target human surfactant proteins B and C. In line with these findings, lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients showed reduced pulmonary surfactant.

290,Infection and mRNA-1273 vaccine antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 UK variant,"Antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein correlate with protection against COVID-19. Serum neutralizing antibodies appear early after symptom onset following SARS-CoV-2 infection and can last for several months. Similarly, the messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, generates serum neutralizing antibodies that are detected through at least day 119. However, the recent emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant has raised significant concerns about the breadth of these neutralizing antibody responses. In this study, we used a live virus neutralization assay to compare the neutralization potency of sera from infected and vaccinated individuals against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. We found that both infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies were effective at neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. These findings support the notion that in the context of the UK variant, vaccine-induced immunity can provide protection against COVID-19.

291,SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are lower in children and increase with age and time after infection,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of children leads to a mild illness and the immunological differences with adults remains unclear. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines. Acute and memory CD4+ T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly increased with age, whilst CD8+ T cell responses increased with time post infection. Infected children had significantly lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In infected adults CD4+ T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies to {beta}-coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults. Therefore, reduced prior {beta}-coronavirus immunity and reduced activation and recruitment of de novo responses in children may drive milder COVID-19 pathogenesis.",Carolyn A Cohen; Athena PY Li; Asmaa Hachim; David SC Hui; Mike YW Kwan; Owen TY Tsang; Susan S Chiu; Wai Hung Chan; Yat Sun Yau; Niloufar Kavian; Fionn NL Ma; Eric HY Lau; Samuel MS Cheng; Leo LM Poon; Malik JS Peiris; Sophie A Valkenburg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250988,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250988,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
292,Impact of systemic corticosteroids on hospitalized patients with COVID-19: January 2021 Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a myriad of potential therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids. The first RCT reporting results on the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the RECOVERY trial published in July, 2020. The RECOVERY trial showed a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received oral or intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days.

This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the analysis process.

MethodsMeta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing systemic corticosteroids to usual care or placebo.

ResultsFive English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7645 hospitalized patients worldwide using systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. Three RCTs were discontinued when preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial became available.

Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to usual care or placebo (Odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.05, p = 0.09). Subgroup analysis from the 1967 critically ill patients in the identified RCTs showed improved survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy (Odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.87, p = 0.01).

ConclusionsThis meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The early termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis.

293,Arabic validation and cross-cultural adaptation of the 5C scale for assessment of COVID-19 vaccines psychological antecedents,"BackgroundIn the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.

MethodsThe 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then subsequently translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged [&ge;]18 years) were included in the final analysis. Convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha.

ResultsAge of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females, 37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from UAE, and 30% were healthcare workers. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha [&ge;]0.7). Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-total correlation (P<0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix (<0.7). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA=0.060,GFI=0.924, CFI=0.957, TLI=0.937, SRMR=0.076 & NFI=906).

294,Bronchoscopy in COVID19 ARDS patients on mechanical ventilation: a prospective study,"BackgroundBronchoscopy has been done sparingly in COVID19 patients due to the risk of aerosol generation, with few reports describing its clinical utility. We describe a study on bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated (MV) COVID-19 patients outlining the procedural, clinical, utilitarian and safety aspects.

MethodsBedside bronchoscopy was performed in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases on MV; only positive cases were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, bronchoscopic and laboratory findings were noted and analysed.

Results98 procedures were performed on 61 patients, mean age of 62.1 years, 51 (83.6%) males. 42 patients (69%) had at least 1 co-morbidity. Major indications for bronchoscopy were new radiographic infiltrates with clinical deterioration, increased endotracheal tube (ETT) secretions and haemorrhagic secretions/hemoptysis. Common findings were copious secretions in 87 (88.8%), purulent in 61%, mucoid in 18%, haemorrhagic in 7% and frothy in 14% cases. Morphologically, hyperaemic airways were seen in 85 (86.7%) cases, ranging from mild (61%) to moderate-severe (39%). On the management front, antibiotics were changed in 31 (31.6%) cases based on bronchoscopic findings. Other significant changes included reduction or stopping of steroids and anticoagulation, fluid, and diuretic adjustment and ETT repositioning. The incidence of bacterial superinfection was also high (54% culture positivity for various bacteria), a significant number (94%) with multi-drug resistant organisms. Fungi were seen in 7 cases (7.1%). Pneumocystis jiroveci was not seen and cytology did not show any viral inclusions. Therapeutic mucus plug removal was done in 30 cases (30.6%), and hemoptysis control in 4% cases. The procedures were safe with no complications, and none of the HCW developed any COVID19 infection.

295,Human mobility and COVID-19 transmission: a systematic review and future directions,"Without a widely distributed vaccine, controlling human mobility has been identified and promoted as the primary strategy to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. Many studies have reported the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 transmission by utilizing the spatial-temporal information of mobility data from various sources. To better understand the role of human mobility in the pandemic, we conducted a systematic review of articles that measure the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 in terms of their data sources, statistical models, and key findings. Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we selected 47 articles from Web of Science Core Collection up to September 2020. Restricting human mobility reduced the transmission of COVID-19 spatially, although the effectiveness and stringency of policy implementation vary temporally and spatially across different stages of the pandemic. We call for prompt and sustainable measures to control the pandemic. We also recommend researchers 1) to enhance multi-disciplinary collaboration; 2) to adjust the implementation and stringency of mobility-control policies in corresponding to the rapid change of the pandemic; 3) to improve statistical models used in analyzing, simulating, and predicting the transmission of the disease; and 4) to enrich the source of mobility data to ensure data accuracy and suability.",Mengxi Zhang; Siqin Wang; Tao Hu; Xiaokang Fu; Xiaoyue Wang; Yaxin Hu; Briana Halloran; Yunhe Cui; Haokun Liu; Zhimin Liu; Shuming Bao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250889,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250889,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
296,A Comparison of Methylprednisolone and Dexamethasone in Intensive Care Patients with COVID-19,"OBJECTIVESThis study retrospectively compares the effectiveness of methylprednisolone to dexamethasone in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) requiring ICU care.

DESIGNThis is an institutional review board approved cohort study in patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit admission. Patients admitted and requiring oxygen supplementation were treated with either methylprednisolone or dexamethasone.

SETTINGThis study takes place in the intensive care units at a large, tertiary, public teaching hospital serving a primarily low-income community in urban Los Angeles.

PATIENTSAll eligible patients admitted to the intensive care unit for COVID-19 respiratory failure from March 1 to July 31, 2020 were included in this study.

INTERVENTIONSA total of 262 patients were grouped as receiving usual care (n=75), methylprednisolone dosed at least at 1mg/kg/day for [&ge;] 3 days (n=104), or dexamethasone dosed at least at 6 mg for [&ge;] 7 days (n=83).

MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTSAll-cause mortality within 50 days of initial corticosteroid treatment as compared to usual care was calculated. The mortality effect was then stratified based on levels of respiratory support received by the patient.

In this cohort of 262 patients with severe COVID-19, all-cause mortalities in the usual care, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone groups were 41.3%, 16.4% and 26.5% at 50 days (p <0.01) respectively. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 42% lower in the methylprednisolone group than in the dexamethasone group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI: 0.235-0.956, p=0.0385).

297,A Dynamic Bayesian Model for Identifying High-Mortality Risk in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"IntroductionAs COVID-19 hospitalization rates remain high, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic factors to improve treatment. Our analysis, to our knowledge, is one of the first to quantify the risk associated with dynamic clinical measurements taken throughout the course of hospitalization.

MethodsWe collected data for 553 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital whose eventual outcomes were known. The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients laboratory values.

ResultsFrom the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk. The lab values upon admission most associated with mortality included neutrophil percentage, RBC, RDW, protein levels, platelets count, albumin levels and MCHC. Incorporating dynamic changes in lab values throughout hospitalization lead to dramatic gains in the predictive accuracy of the model and indicated a catalogue of variables for determining high-risk patients including eosinophil percentage, WBC, platelets, pCO2, RDW, LUC count, alkaline phosphatase and albumin.

ConclusionOur prognostic model highlights the nuance of determining risk for COVID-19 patients and indicates that, rather than a single variable, a range of factors (at different points in hospitalization) are needed for effective risk stratification.",Amir Momeni-Boroujeni; Rachelle Mendoza; Isaac J.

298,COVID-19 infection and subsequent thromboembolism: A self-controlled case series analysis of a population cohort,"ImportanceAn unexpectedly large number of people infected with Covid-19 appear to have experienced ischaemic stroke or thrombotic event.

ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the risk associations between Covid-19 infection and thromboembolism.

DesignThis is a self-controlled case-series study in Scotland. Their incidence rates during the risk interval (5 days before to 56 days after the positive test) and the control interval (the remaining periods) were compared intra-personally.

SettingPopulation-based.

ParticipantsIndividuals with confirmed (positive test) Covid-19 and at least one thromboembolic event between March 2018 and October 2020.

ExposureCovid-19 test positive.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresMyocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) hospital admissions and deaths.

ResultsAcross Scotland, 1,449 individuals tested positive for Covid-19 and experienced a thromboembolic event. The risk of thromboembolism was significantly elevated over the whole risk period but highest in the 7 days following the positive test (IRR 12.01, 95% CI 9.91-14.56), especially among people [&le;]75 years (IRR 22.78, 95% CI 17.58-29.53). Risk of MI, stroke, PE and DVT were all significantly higher in the week following a positive test. The risk of PE and DVT was particularly high and remained significantly elevated even 56 days following the test.

Conclusions and relevanceConfirmed Covid-19 infection was associated with early elevated risk of MI, ischaemic stroke, and stronger and long elevations in risk with DVT and PE, reinforcing the need to consider monitoring and early diagnosis. Treatment and prevention trials may need to be considered out of hospital on the basis of risk stratification.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes Covid-19 infection increase the risk of thromboembolism?

299,GPS-estimated foot traffic data and venue selection for COVID-19 serosurveillance studies,"1Tracking the dynamics and spread of COVID-19 is critical to mounting an effective response to the pandemic. In the absence of randomized representative serological surveys, many SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies have relied on convenience sampling to estimate cumulative incidence. One common approach is to recruit at frequently visited community locations (""venue-based"" sampling), but the sources of bias and uncertainty associated with this strategy are still poorly understood. Here, we used data from a venue-based community serosurveillance study, GPS-estimated foot traffic data, and data on confirmed COVID-19 cases to report an estimate of cumulative incidence in Somerville, Massachusetts, and a methodological strategy to quantify and reduce uncertainty in serology-based cumulative incidence estimates obtained via convenience sampling. The mismatch between the geographic distribution of participants home locations (the ""participant catchment distribution"") and the geographic distribution of infections is an important determinant of uncertainty in venue-based and other convenience sampling strategies. We found that uncertainty in cumulative incidence estimates can vary by a factor of two depending how well the participant catchment distribution matches the known or expected geographic distribution of prior infections. GPS-estimated business foot traffic data provides an important proxy measure for the participant catchment area and can be used to select venue locations that minimize uncertainty in cumulative incidence.",Tyler S Brown; Pablo Martinez de Salazar Munoz; Abhishek Bhatia; Bridget Bunda; Ellen K Williams; David Bor; James S Miller; Amir Mohareb; Vivek Naranbai; Wilfredo Garcia Beltran; Tyler E Miller; Julia Thierauf; Wenxin Yang; Doug Kress; Kristen Stelljes; Keith Johnson; Daniel B Larremore; Jochen Lennerz; A.

This study investigated COVID19-related and all-cause deaths among middle-aged and older adults during the first wave of COVID19 epidemic period, assessing mortality risks by pre-existing socio-demographic and medical underlying conditions.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study involving 79,083 individuals [&ge;]50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Baseline cohort characteristics (age/sex, comorbidities and medications/vaccinations history) were established at study start (01/03/2020) and main outcomes were COVID19-related deaths (occurred in patients diagnosed with the disease) and all-cause deaths occurred among cohort members between 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Mortality risks were assessed by Cox regression analyses.

ResultsCohort members were followed for 1,356,358 persons-weeks, occurring 576 all-cause deaths (124 COVID19-related). All-cause mortality rate was 42.5 deaths per 100,000 persons-week, being 22.8 in healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, 236.4 in COVID19-excluded/PCR-negative subjects, 493.7 in COVID19-compatible/PCR-unperformed subjects and 4009.1 in COVID19-confirmed patients. In multivariable analyses, increasing age, sex male, nursing-home residence, cancer, neurologic, cardiac or liver disease, receiving diuretics, systemic corticosteroids, proton-pump inhibitors and benzodiazepines were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality; conversely, receiving renin-angiotensin inhibitors and statins were associated with reduced risk. Age/years, sex male and nursing-home residence were strong predictors for COVID19-related mortality, but none comorbidity appeared significantly associated with an increased risk.

ConclusionApart from direct COVID19-related deaths (which represented almost 22% of all-cause mortality), theoretically COVID19-excluded patients (PCR-negative) suffered considerable greater all-cause mortality than healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, which could explain, in part, the large excess deaths observed across the COVID19 pandemic.",Angel Vila-corcoles; Eva Satue-Gracia; Angel Vila-Rovira; Cinta de Diego-Cabanes; Maria Jose Forcadell-Peris; Olga Ochoa-Gondar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251028,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251028,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

Results from a national cross-sectional online survey,"ObjectiveTo describe changes in sexual behaviours, including virtual sex (sexting and cybersex), and access to STI&HIV testing and care during COVID-19 measures in Panama.

MethodWe conducted an online cross-sectional survey from August 8 to September 12, 2020, among adults ([&ge;]18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to STI&HIV testing and HIV care and sexual behaviours three months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes.

ResultWe recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men, and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender; median age was 28y (IQR:23-37y), 531/957 (55.5%) were of mixed-ethnicity (mixed-Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181/470) cis-women, 58.4% (184/315) cis-men and 45.0% (27/60) non-binary participants; during COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230/800 [28.8%] of participants reported decreased casual sex compared to pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared to pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex were reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared to cis-women (39.2% versus 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.57-3.01); and by Afro-descendant compared to mixed-ethnicity participants (40.0% versus 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.07-2.94). Compared to no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increase in virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.10-2.88); and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95%CI:7.74-35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, STI&HIV testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58/100) participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8/15) HIV-positive participants.

302,Ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality during the first two waves of the Coronavirus Pandemic: a nationwide cohort study of 29 million adults in England,"BackgroundEthnic minorities have experienced disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates in the UK and many other countries. We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves.

MethodsUsing data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset on individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We estimated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions.

ResultsThe study population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7 - 376.2] and 166.8 [141.7 - 191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4 - 390.1] and 127.1 [91.1 - 171.3] in men and women)background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves.

ConclusionBetween the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes.

*VN and NI contributed equally to this paper

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA recent systematic review by Pan and colleagues demonstrated that people of ethnic minority background in the UK and the USA have been disproportionately affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, compared to White populations. While several studies have investigated whether adjusting for socio-demographic and economic factors and medical history reduces the estimated difference in risk of mortality and hospitalisation, the reasons for the differences in the risk of experiencing harms from COVID-19 are still being explored during the course of the pandemic. Studies so far have analysed the ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave of the pandemic. The evidence on the temporal trend of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality, especially those from the second wave of the pandemic, is scarce.

Added value of this studyUsing data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Data Asset on 29 million adults aged 30-100 years living in private households in England, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine the differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We find that in the first wave all ethnic minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death attenuated for Black African and Black Caribbean groups, remained substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi background, and worsened in people from Pakistani background. We also find that some of the factors explaining these differences in mortality have changed in the two waves.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of COVID-19 mortality during the first wave of the pandemic was elevated in people from ethnic minority background. An appreciable reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality in the second wave of the pandemic between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group is reassuring, but the continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy response. Focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. Focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities in COVID-19 mortality.",Vahe Nafilyan; Nazrul Islam; Rohini Mathur; Daniel Ayoubkhani; Amitava Banerjee; Myer Glickman; Ben Humberstone; Ian DIamond; Kamlesh Khunti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251004,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251004,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
303,Using a household structured branching process to analyse contact tracing in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"We explore strategies of contact tracing, case isolation and quarantine of exposed contacts to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic using a branching process model with household structure. This structure reflects higher transmission risks among household members than among non-household members, and is also the level at which physical distancing policies have been applied. We explore implementation choices that make use of household structure, and investigate strategies including two-step tracing, backwards tracing, smartphone tracing and tracing upon symptom report rather than test results. The primary model outcome is the effect on the growth rate of the epidemic under contact tracing in combination with different levels of physical distancing, and we investigate epidemic extinction times to indicate the time period over which interventions must be sustained. We consider effects of non-uptake of isolation/quarantine, non-adherence, and declining recall of contacts over time. We find that compared to self-isolation of cases but no contact tracing, a household-based contact tracing strategy allows for some relaxation of physical distancing measures; however, it is unable to completely control the epidemic in the absence of other measures. Even assuming no imported cases and sustainment of moderate distancing, testing and tracing efforts, the time to bring the epidemic to extinction could be in the order of months to years.",Martyn Fyles; Elizabeth Fearon; Christopher Overton; - University of Manchester COVID-19 Working Group; Tom Wingfield; Graham F Medley; Ian Hall; Lorenzo Pellis; Thomas House,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250992,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250992,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
304,"Field performance evaluation of the PanBio rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay in an epidemic driven by 501Y.v2 (lineage B.1.351) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa","BackgroundSouth Africa was the African country most severely affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during 2020, experiencing 2 waves of infection. During the first wave, diagnostics were largely based on reverse transcription-linked PCR (RT-PCR). The Abbott PanBio antigen test was deployed during the 2nd wave which was driven by emergence of the 501Y.v2 variant. At the time of evaluation in mid-November 2020, 501Y.v2 was the dominant circulating virus in Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape Province.

MethodsA prospective diagnostic evaluation study was undertaken, during a period of high community transmission, to evaluate the field performance of the PanBio antigen RTD. Testing was conducted at mobile community testing centres on 677 ambulant patients seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing. RT-PCR was performed on the original naso-pharyngeal antigen swabs to evaluate test performance.

ResultsOf 146 RT-PCR positive individuals, 101 were RTD positive in the clinic. The antigen RTD had an overall sensitivity of 69.2% (95%CI 61.4, 75.8) and specificity of 99.0% (95%CI 98.8, 99.3) in this clinical context. Sensitivity was strongly dependent on the amount of virus in clinical samples, as reflected by the PCR cycle threshold (CT) value, with 100% detection in samples where the CT was <20, 96% with CT between 20-25, 89% with CT between 26-30 and 64% when CT was 31-35.

ConclusionsThe assay reliably detected 501Y.v2 infections in ambulatory ill patients. Assay sensitivity was >90% in patients with high viral loads who are expected to be most infectious. Negative and positive predictive values were also >90%.",Oluwakemi Laguda Akingba; Kaitlin Sprong; Diana Ruth Hardie,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251057,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251057,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

Similar newborn protection would be expected after maternal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19). There is a significant and urgent need for research regarding safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Here, we report the first known case of an infant with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detectable in cord blood after maternal vaccination.

Case presentationA vigorous, healthy, full-term female was born to a COVID-19 naive mother who had received a single dose of mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 three weeks prior to delivery. Cord blood antibodies (IgG) were detected to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 at time of delivery.

306,Intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine: Results from a population-based survey in Canada,"ObjectiveThe success of any COVID-19 vaccine program ultimately depends on high vaccine uptake. This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and identified factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada.

MethodsIndividuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia aged 25-69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Two multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsOf 4,528 respondents, 79.8% intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In multivariable modeling, respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine attitudinal scores (p <0.001), reported greater influence of direct social norms (p = 0.001), and indirect social norms, including their family physician (p = 0.024), and Provincial Health Officer (p = 0.011). Older individuals (>60 years) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine, while females (95%CI 0.57,0.93), those with less than high school education (95%CI 0.5,0.76), those who self-identified as non-white (95%CI 0.60,0.92), self-identified as Indigenous (95%CI 0.36,0.84) and essential non-health care workers (95%CI 0.59,0.86) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsTo optimize vaccine coverage, public health should focus on key messages around vaccine safety and benefit, and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging. As certain key populations report a lower intention to vaccinate, there is a need for in-depth education and support for these communities to ensure optimal uptake.",Gina Ogilvie; Shanlea Gordon; Laurie Smith; Arianne Albert; Amy Booth; C Sarai Racey; Anna Gottschlich; David M Goldfarb; Melanie C.

307,Development of a highly sensitive bioanalytical assay for the quantification of favipiravir.,"Favipiravir (FAV; T-705) has been approved for use as an anti-influenza therapeutic and has reports against a wide range of viruses (e.g., Ebola virus, rabies and norovirus). Most recently FAV has been reported to demonstrate activity against SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing opportunities have been intensively studied with only limited success to date. If successful, repurposing will allow interventions to become more rapidly available than development of new chemical entities. Pre-clinical and clinical investigations of FAV require robust, reproducible and sensitive bioanalytical assay. Here, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay is presented which was linear from 0.78-200 ng/mL Accuracy and precision ranged between 89% and 110%, 101% and 106%, respectively.

308,Evaluation of individual and ensemble probabilistic forecasts of COVID-19 mortality in the US,"Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. In 2020, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized hundreds of thousands of specific predictions from more than 50 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. This manuscript systematically evaluates 23 models that regularly submitted forecasts of reported weekly incident COVID-19 mortality counts in the US at the state and national level. One of these models was a multi-model ensemble that combined all available forecasts each week. The performance of individual models showed high variability across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a naive baseline model. In combining the forecasts from all teams, the ensemble showed the best overall probabilistic accuracy of any model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions farther into the future, with probabilistic accuracy at a 20-week horizon more than 5 times worse than when predicting at a 1-week horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.",Estee Y Cramer; Evan L Ray; Velma K Lopez; Johannes Bracher; Andrea Brennen; Alvaro J Castro Rivadeneira; Aaron Gerding; Tilmann Gneiting; Katie H House; Yuxin Huang; Dasuni Jayawardena; Abdul H Kanji; Ayush Khandelwal; Khoa Le; Anja Muhlemann; Jarad Niemi; Apurv Shah; Ariane Stark; Yijin Wang; Nutcha Wattanachit; Martha W Zorn; Youyang Gu; Sansiddh Jain; Nayana Bannur; Ayush Deva; Mihir Kulkarni; Srujana Merugu; Alpan Raval; Siddhant Shingi; Avtansh Tiwari; Jerome White; Spencer Woody; Maytal Dahan; Spencer Fox; Kelly Gaither; Michael Lachmann; Lauren Ancel Meyers; James G Scott; Mauricio Tec; Ajitesh Srivastava; Glover E George; Jeffrey C Cegan; Ian D Dettwiller; William P England; Matthew W Farthing; Robert H Hunter; Brandon Lafferty; Igor Linkov; Michael L Mayo; Matthew D Parno; Michael A Rowland; Benjamin D Trump; Sabrina M Corsetti; Thomas M Baer; Marisa C Eisenberg; Karl Falb; Yitao Huang; Emily T Martin; Ella McCauley; Robert L Myers; Tom Schwarz; Daniel Sheldon; Graham Casey Gibson; Rose Yu; Liyao Gao; Yian Ma; Dongxia Wu; Xifeng Yan; Xiaoyong Jin; Yu-Xiang Wang; YangQuan Chen; Lihong Guo; Yanting Zhao; Quanquan Gu; Jinghui Chen; Lingxiao Wang; Pan Xu; Weitong Zhang; Difan Zou; Hannah Biegel; Joceline Lega; Timothy L Snyder; Davison D Wilson; Steve McConnell; Yunfeng Shi; Xuegang Ban; Robert Walraven; Qi-Jun Hong; Stanley Kong; James A Turtle; Michal Ben-Nun; Pete Riley; Steven Riley; Ugur Koyluoglu; David DesRoches; Bruce Hamory; Christina Kyriakides; Helen Leis; John Milliken; Michael Moloney; James Morgan; Gokce Ozcan; Chris Schrader; Elizabeth Shakhnovich; Daniel Siegel; Ryan Spatz; Chris Stiefeling; Barrie Wilkinson; Alexander Wong; Sean Cavany; Guido Espana; Sean Moore; Rachel Oidtman; Alex Perkins; Zhifeng Gao; Jiang Bian; Wei Cao; Juan Lavista Ferres; Chaozhuo Li; Tie-Yan Liu; Xing Xie; Shun Zhang; Shun Zheng; Alessandro Vespignani; Matteo Chinazzi; Jessica T Davis; Kunpeng Mu; Ana Pastore y Piontti; Xinyue Xiong; Andrew Zheng; Jackie Baek; Vivek Farias; Andreea Georgescu; Retsef Levi; Deeksha Sinha; Joshua Wilde; Nicolas D Penna; Leo A Celi; Saketh Sundar; Dave Osthus; Lauren Castro; Geoffrey Fairchild; Isaac Michaud; Dean Karlen; Elizabeth C Lee; Juan Dent; Kyra H Grantz; Joshua Kaminsky; Kathryn Kaminsky; Lindsay T Keegan; Stephen A Lauer; Joseph C Lemaitre; Justin Lessler; Hannah R Meredith; Javier Perez-Saez; Sam Shah; Claire P Smith; Shaun A Truelove; Josh Wills; Matt Kinsey; RF Obrecht; Katharine Tallaksen; John C.

309,Catching SARS-CoV-2 by sequence hybridization: a comparative analysis,"Controlling and monitoring the still ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic regarding geographical distributions, evolution and emergence of new mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is only possible due to continuous next-generation sequencing (NGS) and worldwide sequence data sharing. Efficient sequencing strategies enabling the retrieval of the maximum number of high quality, full-length genomes are hence indispensable. Here, we describe for the first time a combined approach of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and NGS to evaluate five commercially available sequence capture panels targeting SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we were not only able to determine the most sensitive and specific capture panel, but to discriminate their mode of action and number of read pairs needed to recover a high quality full length genome. Thereby, we are providing essential information for all sequencing laboratories worldwide striving for maximizing the sequencing output and simultaneously minimizing time, costs and sequencing resources.",Alexandra Rehn; Peter Braun; Mandy Knuepfer; Roman Woelfel; Markus H.

310,SARS-CoV-2 ORF7b: is a bat virus protein homologue a major cause of COVID-19 symptoms?,"ORF7b is an accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic. Using cell-free synthesized ORF7b, we experimentally show that ORF7b assembles into stable multimers. The ORF7b sequence shows a transmembrane segment, which multimerizes through a leucine zipper. We hypothesize that ORF7b has the potential to interfere with important cellular processes that involve leucine-zipper formation, and present two particularly striking examples. First, leucine zippers are central in heart rhythm regulation through multimerization of phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Second, epithelial cell-cell adhesion relies on E-cadherins, which dimerize using a transmembrane leucine zipper. Most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including heart arrythmias, odor loss, impaired oxygen uptake and intestinal problems, up to multiorgan failure, can be rationalized by a possible interference of ORF7b with the functions of these proteins. We ask whether this is pure coincidence, or whether our observations point to disruption by ORF7b of vital processes in COVID-19.",Marie-Laure Fogeron; Roland Montserret; Johannes Zehnder; Minh-Ha Nguyen; Marie Dujardin; Louis Brigandat; Laura Cole; Marti Ninot-Pedrosa; Lauriane Lecoq; Beat H Meier; Anja Bockmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428650,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428650,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
311,Collaboration between the Fab and Fc contribute to maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates following NVX-CoV2373 subunit vaccine with Matrix-M™ vaccination,"Recently approved vaccines have already shown remarkable protection in limiting SARS-CoV-2 associated disease. However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, as well as how boosting alters immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels, administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M. While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

312,Post-infection treatment with a protease inhibitor increases survival of mice with a fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to be a serious global public health threat. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a virus protease encoded by SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for virus replication. We have previously reported a series of small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors effective for inhibiting replication of human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in animal models. Here we generated a series of deuterated variants of a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, and evaluated the antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. The deuterated GC376 displayed potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the enzyme and the cell-based assays. The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and was proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 hr post infection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Structural investigation using high-resolution crystallography illuminated binding interactions of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with deuterated variants of GC376.

313,Protein glycosylation is essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 extensively N-glycosylates its surface spike (S) proteins. This post-translational modification is essential to modulate protein conformation and host cell invasion. Each S monomer can be modified with up to 22 N-glycans. To meet the high demand of protein glycosylation during virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 upregulates the expression of host N-glycosylation genes. Although a substantial amount of detail is known about the structure of S protein N-glycans, the role of N-glycosylation in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely undetermined. Here, we investigated the essentiality of the host N-glycosylation pathway and viral N-glycans for SARS-CoV-2 infection. When either monkey or human cells were preincubated with glycosylation inhibitors, including FDA-approved iminosugars, virus infection was significantly reduced. This infection phenotype was confirmed after RNAi knockdown of several glycosylation genes. In addition, enzymatic deglycosylation of whole viral particles confirmed that accessible oligosaccharides on the SARS-CoV-2 surface are essential for host cell infection. Altogether, we show evidence that the normal functioning of the host N- glycosylation machinery is essential not only for SARS-CoV-2 to infect, but also to produce new functional virions. These findings open the door for developing new approaches targeting N-glycosylation against COVID-19.",Aitor Casas-Sanchez; Alessandra Romero-Ramirez; Eleanor Hargreaves; Edward I Patterson; Grant L Hughes; Tobias Zech; Alvaro Acosta-Serrano,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429940,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429940,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
314,Serological Profile Of Specific Antibodies Against Dominant Antigens Of SARS-CoV-2 In Chilean COVID-19 Patients.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has been a pandemic since March 2020. Currently, the virus has infected more than 50 million people worldwide and more than half a million in Chile. For many coronaviruses, Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins are described as major antigenic molecules, inducing seroconversion and production of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we evaluated the presence in serum of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using western blot, and developed an ELISA test for the qualitative characterization of COVID-19 patients. Patients with an active infection or who have recovered from COVID-19 showed specific immunoblotting patterns for the recombinants S protein and its domains S1 and S2, as well as for the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-N antibodies were more frequently detected than anti-S or anti-S1-RBD antibodies. People who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 did not show reactivity. Finally, indirect ELISA assays using N and S1-RBD proteins, alone or in combination, were established with variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the antigen bound to the solid phase. Overall, Spike showed higher specificity than the nucleocapsid, and comparable sensitivity for both antigens. Both approaches confirmed the seroconversion after infection and allowed us to implement the analysis of antibodies in blood for research purposes in a local facility.",Karina Cereceda; Roxana Gonzalez-Stegmaier; Jose Luis Briones; Carolina Selman; Adam Aguirre; Guillermo Valenzuela-Nieto; Christian Caglevic; Raimundo Gazitua; Alejandro Rojas-Fernandez; Franz Villaroel-Espíndola,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429566,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429566,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
315,Furin cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is modulated by O-glycosylation,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the global pandemic contains a unique furin cleavage site in the spike protein (S) that increases viral infectivity and syncytia formation. Here, we show that O-glycosylation near the furin cleavage site is mediated by specific members of the GALNT enzyme family and is dependent on the novel proline at position 681 (P681). We further demonstrate that O-glycosylation of S decreases furin cleavage. Finally, we show that GALNT family members capable of glycosylating S are expressed in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that O-glycosylation may influence viral infectivity/tropism by modulating furin cleavage of S and provide mechanistic insight into the potential role of P681 mutations in the recently identified, highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant.",Liping Zhang; Matthew Mann; Zulfeqhar Syed; Hayley M.

Whether and when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can be lifted as vaccination builds up remains key questions. To address them, we built a data-driven SARS-CoV-2 transmission model for China. We estimated that, to prevent local outbreaks to escalate to major widespread epidemics, stringent NPIs need to remain in place at least one year after the start of vaccination. Should NPIs be capable to keep the reproduction number (Rt) around 1.3, vaccination could reduce up to 99% of COVID-19 burden and bring Rt below the epidemic threshold in 9 months.

318,Point-of-care evaluation of a rapid antigen test (CLINITEST Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals,"Rapid antigen assays (RAD) based on lateral flow immunochromatography (LFIC) technology have emerged as a valuable tool for the control of COVID-19 pandemic. Manufacturer{square}independent, real{square}world evaluation of these assays is crucial given the considerable heterogeneity reported in their clinical and analytical performances. Here, we report for the first time on the point-of-care performance of the CLINITEST(R) Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test (Siemens, Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in presumptive COVID-19 cases or asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients. When compared to RT-PCR, the overall sensitivity of the assay was 80.2 (95% CI, 70.9-87.1) for symptomatic patients sampled (nasopharyngeal specimens) within five days after the onset of symptoms and 60% (95% CI, 40.7-76.6%) for asymptomatic participants.

319,Usability of saliva collection devices for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics,"There is an urgent need to expand testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens as the global community struggles to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Current diagnostic methods can be affected by supply chain bottlenecks and require the assistance of medical professionals, impeding the implementation of large-scale testing. Self-collection of saliva may solve these problems because it can be completed without specialized training and uses generic materials. In this study, we observed thirty individuals who self-collected saliva using four different collection devices and analyzed their feedback. These devices enabled the safe collection of saliva that was acceptable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.",Mary E. Petrone; Devyn Yolda-Carr; Mallery Breban; Hannah Walsh; Orchid Allicock; Anne E.

320,Estimation of infection rate and the population size potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Japan during 2020,"BackgroundThe infectious respiratory disease COVID-19, caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached pandemic status during 2020. The primary statistic data are important to survey the actual circumstances of COVID-19. Here, we report the analysis of the primary data of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020.

MethodsData were collected and released systematically under Japan domestic law. Machine learning was conducted to estimate the positive rate in Japan and four prefectures (Tokyo, Osaka, Chiba, and Fukuoka).

ResultsPrimary data analysis revealed there were at least two peaks of infection in Japan; the first one was during April 2020 and the second one started from November 1, 2020. Estimating the positive rate in Japan as well as in the four prefectures reinforced the above observations. The positive rate in Japan during 2020 was estimated to be around 6% to 8%. We also estimated that 1.95 million people were possibly exposed to the novel virus on October 31, 2020. The numbers of related deaths were over 3,000 people at the end of 2020.

ConclusionWe estimated the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan to be 6-8% in 2020. We also concluded that Japan had at least two infection-spreading periods, the first one being from Jan 19, 2020 until May 2020, and the second one beginning from November 1, 2020. Importantly, our analysis supports the need for clear definition of the criteria for conducting confirmation tests before embarking on data analysis.",Motohiko Naito,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250971,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250971,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,True
321,The mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily shaped by the host antiviral defense,"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution is a fundamental effort in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are the two inter-dependent mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i) antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins and (ii) probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 genomes are evolving worldwide. Revealing the evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand host-virus interactions. Here, we aim to understand whether mutagenesis or selection is the primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This study provides an unbiased computational method for profiling and analyzing independently occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The results point out three host antiviral mechanisms shaping the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins.

322,The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and the dynamics of the S gene furin cleavage site in primary human airway epithelia,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the devastating ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which poses a great threat to global public health. The spike (S) polypeptide of SARS-CoV-2 consists of the S1 and S2 subunits and is processed by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 boundary. The inclusion of the 4 amino acids (PRRA) at the S1/S2 boundary forms a furin cleavage site (FCS), 682RRAR{downarrow}S686, distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its closest relative, the SARS-CoV. Various deletions surrounding the FCS have been identified in patients. When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, the virus acquired various deletions surrounding the FCS. In the present study, we studied the viral transcriptome in SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability at the S1/S2 boundary using RNA-seq. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the S1/S2 boundary of the S gene: one is a deletion of 12 amino acids, 678TNSPRRAR{downarrow}SVAS689, which contains the FCS, another is a deletion of 5 amino acids, 675QTQTN679, which is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the S gene stability in HAE-ALI but with exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are remained at a high rate. Thus, our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is donor-dependent.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429670,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429670,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
323,Sensitive visualization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with CoronaFISH,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus contains a single linear RNA segment that serves as a template for transcription and replication, leading to the synthesis of positive and negative-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) in infected cells. Tools to visualize viral RNA directly in infected cells are critical to analyze its replication cycle, screen for therapeutic molecules or study infections in human tissue. Here, we report the design, validation and initial application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes to visualize positive or negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaFISH). We demonstrate sensitive visualization of vRNA in African green monkey and several human cell lines, in patient samples and human tissue. We further demonstrate the adaptation of CoronaFISH probes to electron microscopy (EM). We provide all required oligonucleotide sequences, source code to design the probes, and a detailed protocol. We hope that CoronaFISH will complement existing techniques for research on SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology, drug screening and diagnostics.",Elena I.

324,"Targeted in situ cross-linking mass spectrometry and integrative modeling reveal the architectures of Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nucleocapsid proteins from SARS-CoV-2","Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell. Here, we applied targeted in situ CLMS to structurally probe Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins from SARS-CoV-2, and obtained cross-link sets with an average density of one cross-link per twenty residues. We then employed integrative modeling that computationally combined the cross-linking data with domain structures to determine full-length atomic models. For the Nsp2, the cross-links report on a complex topology with long-range interactions. Integrative modeling with structural prediction of individual domains by the AlphaFold2 system allowed us to generate a single consistent all-atom model of the full-length Nsp2. The model reveals three putative metal binding sites, and suggests a role for Nsp2 in zinc regulation within the replication-transcription complex. For the N protein, we identified multiple intra- and inter-domain cross-links. Our integrative model of the N dimer demonstrates that it can accommodate three single RNA strands simultaneously, both stereochemically and electrostatically. For the Nsp1, cross-links with the 40S ribosome were highly consistent with recent cryo-EM structures. These results highlight the importance of cellular context for the structural probing of recalcitrant proteins and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted in situ CLMS and integrative modeling.",Moriya Slavin; Joanna Zamel; Keren Zohar; Siona Eliyahu; Merav Braitbard; Esther Brielle; Leah Baraz; Miri Stolovich-Rain; Ahuva Friedman; Dana G Wolf; Alexander Rouvinski; Michal Linial; Dina Schneidman-Duhovny; Nir Kalisman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429751,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429751,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
325,Bronchoalveolar lavage affects thorax computed tomography of healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"Medical imaging as method to assess the longitudinal process of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates is commonly used in research settings. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also regularly used to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities with each other is unknown in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between timepoints in CT score were increased for the second BAL. These results indicate that the effect of BAL on infected lungs is not completed within the first 24 hours. Therefore, it is of importance to acknowledge the interference between BAL and CT in rhesus macaques.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429761,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429761,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
326,Type-I interferon signatures in SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-{beta} production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment.

327,Large-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein mutants demonstrates the need for continuous screening of virus isolates,"Due to the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is evolving in diverse human populations. Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it.

We analyzed 146,920 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 2,393 NGS datasets from GISAID, NCBI Virus and NCBI SRA archives focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 13.6% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.98% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 2,592 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only nine and 23 recurrent variants were found in at least 0.5% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 15.1% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition.

These findings demonstrate the increasing importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies.",Barbara Schroers; Ranganath Gudimella; Thomas Bukur; Thomas Roesler; Martin Loewer; Ugur Sahin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429765,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429765,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
328,Site-specific O-glycosylation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produced in insect and human cells,"Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S - insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.",Ieva Bagdonaite; Andrew J.

329,Extensive recombination-driven coronavirus diversification expands the pool of potential pandemic pathogens,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the third zoonotic coronavirus identified in the last twenty years. Previously, four other known coronaviruses moved from animal reservoirs into humans and now cause primarily mild-to-moderate respiratory disease. The emergence of these viruses likely involved a period of intense transmission before becoming endemic, highlighting the recurrent threat to human health posed by animal coronaviruses. Enzootic and epizootic coronaviruses of diverse lineages pose a significant threat to livestock, as most recently observed for virulent strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine acute diarrhea-associated coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Unique to RNA viruses, coronaviruses encode a proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) that lowers point mutation rates to increase the viability of large RNA virus genomes, which comes with the cost of limiting virus adaptation via point mutation. This limitation can be overcome by high rates of recombination that facilitate rapid increases in genetic diversification. To compare dynamics of recombination between related sequences, we developed an open-source computational workflow (IDPlot) to measure nucleotide identity, locate recombination breakpoints, and infer phylogenetic relationships. We analyzed recombination dynamics among three groups of coronaviruses with impacts on livestock or human health: SARSr-CoV, Betacoronavirus-1, and SADSr-CoV. We found that all three groups undergo recombination with highly diverged viruses, disrupting phylogenetic relationships and revealing contributions of unknown coronavirus lineages to the genetic diversity of established groups. Dynamic patterns of recombination impact inferences of relatedness between diverse coronaviruses and expand the genetic pool that may contribute to future zoonotic events. These results illustrate the limitations of current sampling approaches for anticipating zoonotic threats to human and animal health.",Stephen A. Goldstein; Joe Brown; Brent S Pedersen; Aaron R.

330,Codon arrangement modulates MHC-I peptides presentation: implications for a SARS-CoV-2 peptide-based vaccine,"Among various vaccination strategies, peptide-based vaccines appear as excellent candidates because they are cheap to produce, are highly stable and harbor low toxicity. However, predicting which MHC-I Associated Peptide (MAP) will ultimately reach cell surface remains challenging, due to high false discovery rates. Previously, we demonstrated that synonymous codon arrangement (usage and placement) is predictive of, and modulates MAP presentation. Here, we apply CAMAP (Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor), the artificial neural network we used to unveil the role of codon arrangement in MAP presentation, to predict SARS-CoV MAPs. We report that experimentally identified SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 MAPs are associated with significantly higher CAMAP scores. Based on CAMAP scores and binding affinity, we identified 48 non-overlapping MAP candidates for a peptide-based vaccine, ensuring coverage for a high proportion of HLA haplotypes in the US population (>78%) and SARS-CoV-2 strains (detected in >98% of SARS-CoV-2 strains present in the GISAID database). Finally, we built an interactive web portal (https://www.epitopes.world) where researchers can freely explore CAMAP predictions for SARS-CoV-1/2 viruses. Collectively, we present an analysis framework that can be generalizable to empower the rapid identification of virus-specific MAPs, including in the context of an emergent virus, to help accelerate target identification for peptide-based vaccine designs that could be critical in safely attaining group immunity in the context of a global pandemic.",Tariq Daouda; Maude Dumont-Lagacé; Albert Feghaly; Alexandra-Chloe Villani,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429819,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429819,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
331,"Follow-up of a hospital cohort during the first 3,530 suspected cases of COVID-19 in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil","IntroductionIn a global context, COVID-19 is the most significant health threat in the present days, evidenced by the fact that, in just over four months, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 171 countries, reaching a Pandemic status. Most patients with COVID-19 have a mild course of the disease. However, approximately 20% develop severe illness with a high mortality rate which is associated with age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Epidemiological studies are used to reveal the extent of viral spread in homes, communities, and hospitals. Thus, preventive and control measures can be established by the authorities.

ObjectiveIn this study, patients with suspect COVID-19 symptoms who search for hospital care at the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto (Sao Paulo, Brazil) were monitored, in order to identify the first case of this new disease in the region. In the first two months (March and April), more than 3000 individuals looked for the public and private health system with suspected respiratory symptoms, but only 164 (8.4%) were COVID-19 confirmed.

ResultsFrom those, males (56.1%) and patients of the age distribution of 16-59 (91.2%), with diarrhea (22.2%), runny nose (25%), altered taste (15.9%), and anosmia (11.6%) presented statistical significance, although none comorbidities were related with COVID-19 occurrence.

To date, little is known about the roles of ER stress, UPR, and autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we over-expressed the viral Spike (S) protein in cultured HEK293T cells, as it has been shown that such protein is largely responsible for UPR activation in other CoV-infected cells. We noticed, in the transfected cells, heightened ER stress, activation of the PERK-eIF2 arm of the UPR, induction of autophagy and cell death. When we treated the transfected cells with Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA), Salubrinal, Trazadone hydrochloride, and Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), we saw reduced the BiP/GRP78 levels, but only PBA and TUDCA could significantly diminish the levels of peIF2 and autophagy expression.",Bijina Balakrishnan; Kent Lai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429769,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429769,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
333,IN-HOSPITAL CONTINUATION WITH ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER MORTALITY RATE THAN CONTINUATION WITH ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS IN COVID-19 PATIENTS A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY,"BackgroundSeveral studies have reported a reduced risk of death associated with the inpatient use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in COVID-19 patients, but have been criticized for incurring in several types of bias. Also, most studies have pooled ACEIs and ARBs as if they were a unique group, overlooking their pharmacological differences. We aimed to assess whether the in-hospital continuation of ARBs and ACEIs, in regular users of these drugs, was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared to their discontinuation and also to compare head-to-head ARBs with ACEIs.

MethodsAdult patients with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission during March, 2020 were consecutively selected from 7 hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Among them, we identified outpatient users of ACEIs/ARBs and divided them in two cohorts depending on treatment discontinuation/continuation at admission. Then, they were followed-up until discharge or in-hospital death. An intention-to-treat survival analysis was carried out and hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95%CI were computed through a Cox regression model adjusted for propensity scores of discontinuation and controlled by potential mediators.

ResultsOut of 625 ACEI/ARB users, 340(54.4%) discontinued treatment. The in-hospital mortality rates were 27.6% and 27.7% in discontinuation and continuation cohorts, respectively (HR=1.01; 95%CI:0.70-1.46). No difference in mortality was observed between ARB and ACEI discontinuation (28.6% vs. 27.1%, respectively), while a significantly lower mortality rate was found among patients who continued with ARBs (20.8%,N=125) as compared to those who continued with ACEIs (33.1%,N=136; p=0.03). The head-to-head comparison (ARB vs. ACEI continuation) yielded an adjusted HR of 0.52 (95%CI:0.29-0.93), being especially notorious among males (HR=0.34; 95%CI:0.12-0.93), subjects older than 74 years (HR=0.46; 95%CI:0.25-0.85), and patients with obesity (HR=0.22; 95%CI:0.05-0.94), diabetes (HR=0.36; 95%CI:0.13-0.97) and heart failure (HR=0.12; 95%CI:0.03-0.97).

ConclusionsAmong regular users of ARBs admitted for COVID-19, the in-hospital continuation with them was associated with an improved survival, while this was not observed with ACEIs. Regular users of ARBs should continue with this treatment if admitted for COVID-19, unless medically contraindicated. In admitted ACEI users, a switching to ARBs should be considered, especially among high-risk patients.

334,Stay Home and Stay Active? The impact of stay-at-home restrictions on physical activity routines in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Government restrictions applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK led to the disruption of many peoples physical activity routines, with sports and leisure facilities closed and outdoor exercise only permitted once per day. In this study we investigated which population groups were impacted most in terms of reduced physical activity levels during these periods, and which groups benefitted in terms of increasing their usual level of physical activity. We surveyed UK residents, sampled through users of a rewards-for-exercise app (Sweatcoin; n=749) and an online panel (Prolific; n=907). Of the app users, n=487 further provided daily step-count data collected by the app, prior to, and during the periods of restrictions between March and June 2020. Regression models were applied to investigate factors associated with subjective change (perceived change in physical activity) and objective change (log-percentage change in daily step-count) in physical activity during the periods of restrictions. ANOVAs were used to further investigate the significant factors identified. Key factors associated with a substantial subjective reduction in physical activity included those classed as obese, gym users and people living in urban areas. All participants had a reduced step count during restrictions, with Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, students and urban dwellers showing the largest reductions. Therefore, targeted interventions are required to ensure that the physical and mental health impacts of sedentary behaviour are not exacerbated over the long-term by significant reductions in physical activity identified in these groups, particularly those who are also more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus.",Victoria Eshelby; Muhammed Sogut; Kate Jolly; Ivo Vlaev; Mark T Elliott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250863,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250863,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
335,Returning to a normal life via COVID-19 vaccines in the USA: a large-scale agent-based simulation study,"BackgroundIn 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 300,000 deaths in the US alone. While non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the USA, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the FDA approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy is renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nation-wide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown.

ObjectiveWe study the effectiveness of a nation-wide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines, through six scenarios that capture a range of possible impact from non-pharmaceutical interventions.

MethodsWe use large-scale cloud-based agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using Covasim, an open-source ABM for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity as well as a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose six non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth is fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates are recorded.

ResultsFor both vaccination plans and all non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low at 20%. We noted an unintended consequence: given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections.

ConclusionsAlthough potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Non-pharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance, so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.",Junjiang Li; Philippe Giabbanelli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250872,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250872,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
336,Limited specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at low temperatures,"SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are available within and outside of health care settings to enable increased access to COVID-19 diagnosis. These environments include provisional testing facilities, lacking temperature control; as outside temperatures fall, recommended testing temperatures cannot be guaranteed. We report impaired specificity in two out of six Ag-RDTs when used at 2-4{degrees}C, indicating that testing in cold settings might cause false-positive results potentially entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments and incorrect incidence estimates.",Verena Claudia Haage; Andres Moreira-Soto; Jilian A.

337,Bayesian Calibration of Using CO2 Sensors to Assess Ventilation Conditions and Associated COVID-19 Airborne Aerosol Transmission Risk in Schools,"Ventilation rate plays a significant role in preventing the airborne transmission of diseases in indoor spaces. Classrooms are a considerable challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic because of large occupancy density and mainly poor ventilation conditions. The indoor CO2 level may be used as an index for estimating the ventilation rate and airborne infection risk. In this work, we analyzed a one-day measurement of CO2 levels in three schools to estimate the ventilation rate and airborne infection risk. Sensitivity analysis and Bayesian calibration methods were applied to identify uncertainties and calibrate key parameters. The outdoor ventilation rate with a 95% confidence was 1.96 {+/-} 0.31ACH for Room 1 with mechanical ventilation and fully open window, 0.40 {+/-} 0.08 ACH for Rooms 2, and 0.79 {+/-} 0.06 ACH for Room 3 with only windows open. A time-averaged CO2 level < 450 ppm is equivalent to a ventilation rate > 10 ACH in all three rooms. We also defined the probability of the COVID-19 airborne infection risk associated with ventilation uncertainties. The outdoor ventilation threshold to prevent classroom COVID-19 aerosol spreading is between 3 - 8 ACH, and the CO2 threshold is around 500 ppm of a school day (< 8 hr) for the three schools.

Practical ImplicationsThe actual outdoor ventilation rate in a room cannot be easily measured, but it can be calculated by measuring the transient indoor CO2 level. Uncertainty in input parameters can result in uncertainty in the calculated ventilation rate. Our three classrooms study shows that the estimated ventilation rate considering various input parameters uncertainties is between {+/-} 8-20 %. As a result, the uncertainty of the ventilation rate contributes to the estimated COVID-19 airborne aerosol infection risks uncertainty up to {+/-} 10 %. Other studies can apply the proposed Bayesian and MCMC method to estimating building ventilation rates and airborne aerosol infection risks based on actual measurement data such as CO2 levels with uncertainties and sensitivity of input parameters identified. The outdoor ventilation rate and CO2 threshold values as functions of exposure times could be used as the baseline models to develop correlations to be implemented by cheap/portable sensors to be applied in similar situations to monitor ventilation conditions and airborne risk levels.",Danlin Hou; Ali Katal; Liangzhu (Leon) Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250791,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250791,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
338,Towards a COVID-19 symptom triad: The importance of symptom constellations in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"Pandemic scenarios like SARS-Cov-2 require rapid information aggregation. In the age of eHealth and data-driven medicine, publicly available symptom tracking tools offer efficient and scalable means of collecting and analyzing large amounts of data. As a result, information gains can be communicated to front-line providers. We have developed such an application in less than a month and reached more than 500 thousand users within 48 hours. The dataset contains information on basic epidemiological parameters, symptoms, risk factors and details on previous exposure to a COVID-19 patient. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed different symptoms reported by users with confirmed contacts vs. no confirmed contacts. The symptom combination of anosmia, cough and fatigue was the most important feature to differentiate the groups, while single symptoms such as anosmia, cough or fatigue alone were not sufficient. A linear regression model from the literature using the same symptom combination as features was applied on all data. Predictions matched the regional distribution of confirmed cases closely across Germany, while also indicating that the number of cases in northern federal states might be higher than officially reported. In conclusion, we report that symptom combinations anosmia, fatigue and cough are most likely to indicate an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Leander Edwin Melms; Evelyn Falk; Bernhard Schieffer; Andreas Jerrentrup; Uwe Wagner; Sami Matrood; Jürgen R Schaefer; Tobias Müller; Martin Hirsch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250537,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250537,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
339,Optimal time to return to normality: parallel use of COVID-19 vaccines and circuit breakers,"By January 2020, the COVID-19 illness has caused over two million deaths. Countries have restricted disease spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing). More severe ""lockdowns"" have also been required. Although lockdowns keep people safer from the virus, they substantially disrupt economies and individual well-being. Fortunately, vaccines are becoming available. Yet, vaccination programs may take several months to implement, requiring further time for individuals to develop immunity following inoculation. To prevent health services being overwhelmed it may be necessary to implement further lockdowns in conjunction with vaccination. Here, we investigate optimal approaches for vaccination under varying lockdown lengths and/or severities to prevent COVID-19-related deaths exceeding critical thresholds. We find increases in vaccination rate cause a disproportionately larger decrease in lockdowns: with vaccination, severe lockdowns can reduce infections by up to 89%. Notably, we include demographics, modelling three groups: vulnerable, front-line workers, and non-vulnerable. We investigate the sequence of vaccination. One counter-intuitive finding is that even though the vulnerable group is high risk, demographically, this is a small group (per person, vaccination occurs more slowly) so vaccinating this group first achieves limited gains in overall disease control. Better disease control occurs by vaccinating the non-vulnerable group with longer and/or more severe lockdowns.",Michael Bonsall; Chris Huntingford; Thomas Rawson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250877,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250877,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
340,RAY: CRISPR diagnostic for rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV2 variants on a paper strip,"The COVID-19 pandemic originating in the Wuhan province of China in late 2019 has impacted global health, causing increased mortality among elderly patients and individuals with comorbid conditions. During the passage of the virus through affected populations, it has undergone mutations- some of which have recently been linked with increased viral load and prognostic complexities. Interestingly, several of these variants are point mutations that are difficult to diagnose using the gold standard quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method. This necessitates widespread sequencing which is expensive, has long turn-around times, and requires high viral load for calling mutations accurately. In this study, we show that the high specificity of Francisella novicida Cas9 (FnCas9) to point mismatches can be successfully adapted for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV2 infection as well as for detecting point mutations in the sequence of the virus obtained from patient samples. We report the detection of the mutation N501Y (earlier shown to be present in the British N501Y.V1, South African N501Y.V2, and Brazilian N501Y.V3 variants of SARS-CoV2) within an hour using paper strip chemistry. The results were corroborated using deep sequencing. Our design principle can be rapidly adapted for other mutations, highlighting the advantages of quick optimization and roll-out of CRISPR diagnostics (CRISPRDx) for disease surveillance even beyond COVID-19.",Manoj Kumar; Sneha Gulati; Asgar H Ansari; Rhythm Phutela; Sundaram Acharya; Poorti Kathpalia; Akshay Kanakan; Ranjeet Maurya; Janani Srinivasa Vasudevan; Aparna Murali; Rajesh Pandey; Souvik Maiti; Debojyoti Chakraborty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250900,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250900,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
341,Antibody seroprevalence and rate of asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Austrian hospital personnel.,"ContextOn March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of infection followed an exponential increase until a complete lockdown in March 2020. Thereafter easing of restrictions was gradually introduced and until mid-August daily infections remained mostly below 5 per 100.000 population.

ObjectivesThe aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM, and/or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) during the study, iii) the antibody decline in seropositive subjects over a period of around six months, and iv) the utility of rapid antibody tests for outpatient screening.

Study DesignOpen uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study.

Setting/ParticipantsA total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in the study.

Study Interventions and MeasuresRapid antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies, and RT-PCR tests based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA/PRNT were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4{+/-}7.7 (Min=30, Max=64) days. Additionally, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities. Antibody positive tested participants were re-tested with ELISA/PRNT tests at a third time point on average 188.0{+/-}12.8 days after their initial test.

ResultsIn our study cohort, only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.81%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among participants who had positive test results in either of the antibody tests, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding six weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%).

The rapid antibody test was generally more sensitive based on serum (sensitivity=86.6%) as compared to whole blood (sensitivity=65.4). Concerning both ELISA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity=88.9%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity=81.5%).

In participants with a positive PRNT, a significant decrease in PRNT concentration from 31.8{+/-}22.9 (Md=32.0) at T1 to 26.1{+/-}17.6 (Md=21.3) at T2 to 21.4{+/-}13.4 (Md=16.0) at T3 ({chi}2=23.848, df=2, p<0.001) was observed ({chi}2=23.848, df=2, p<0.001) - with an average time of 42.4{+/-}7.7 days between T1 and T2 and 146.9{+/-}13.8 days between T2 and T3.

ConclusionsDuring the study period (May 11th - December 21th) only 0.81% were tested positive for antibodies in our study cohort. The antibody concentration decreases significantly over time with 14.8% (4 out of 27) losing detectable antibodies.",Iris Leister; Elisabeth Ponocny-Seliger; Herwig Kollaritsch; Peter Dungel; Barbara Holzer; Johannes Grillari; Heinz Redl; Ivo Ponocny; Claudia Wilfing; Ludwig Aigner; Markus Exner; Michaela Stainer; Matthias Hackl; Thomas Hausner; Rainer Mittermayr; Wolfgang Schaden,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250898,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250898,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
342,One Year of Evidence on Mental Health in the COVID-19 Crisis - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"ObjectiveThis paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence rate of mental health issues of the major population, including general population, general healthcare workers (HCWs), and frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), in China over one year of the COVID-19 crisis.

DesignA systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesarticles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and medRxiv up to November 16, 2020, one year after the first publicly known confirmed COVID-19 case.

Eligibility criteria and data analysisany COVID-19 and mental disorders relevant English studies with frontline/general healthcare workers, general adult population sample, using validated scales. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, distress, general psychological symptoms (GPS), insomnia, and PTSD and ran meta-regression to tease out the heterogeneity.

ResultsThe meta-analysis includes 131 studies and 171 independent samples. The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, GPS, insomnia, and PTSD are 11%, 13%, 20%, 13%, 19%, and 20%, respectively. The meta-regression results uncovered several predictors of the prevalence rates, including severity (e.g., above severe vs. above moderate, p<0.01; above moderate vs. above mild, p<0.01) and type of mental issues (e.g., depression vs. anxiety, p=0.04; insomnia vs. anxiety p=0.04), population (frontline HCWs vs. general HCWs, p<0.01), sampling location (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan, p=0.04), and study quality (p=0.04).

LimitationsFirst, we only focus on China population, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Second, 96.2% studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional. Last, since we only included studies published in English, we expect to have a language bias.

ConclusionOur pooled prevalence rates are significantly different from, yet largely between, the findings of previous meta-analyses, suggesting the results of our larger study are consistent with, yet fine-tune, the findings of the smaller, previous meta-analyses. Hence, this meta-analysis not only provides a significant update on the mental health prevalence rates in COVID-19 but also suggests the need to update meta-analyses continuously to provide more accurate estimates of the prevalence of mental illness during this ongoing health crisis. While prior meta-analyses focused on the prevalence rates of mental health disorders based on one level of severity (i.e., above mild), our findings also suggest a need to examine the prevalence rates at varying levels of severity. The one-year cumulative evidence on sampling locations (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan) corroborates the typhoon eye effect theory. Our finding that the prevalence rates of distress and insomnia and those of frontline healthcare workers are higher suggest future research and interventions should pay more attention to those mental outcomes and populations.

343,How lifestyle changes within the COVID-19 global pandemic have affected the pattern and symptoms of the menstrual cycle.,"BackgroundThe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant changes to homes, working life and stress. The purpose of this research was to investigate the implications that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the menstrual cycle and any contributing factors to these changes.

MethodsA questionnaire was completed by 749 participants, whom ranged from  physically active to elite, in their training status. The questionnaire captured detail on menstrual cycle symptoms and characteristics prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, as well as lifestyle, stress, exercise and nutrition. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribution were reported and decision tree analysis performed. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05.

ResultsFifty-two point six percent of females experienced a change in their menstrual cycle during the lockdown period. Psychosocial symptoms had changed in over half of all participants. Participants who reported increased stress/worry in family and personal health were significantly associated with changes in menstrual symptoms. Similarly, job security stress was associated with increases in bleeding time (p<0.05).

344,"The effect of mobility restrictions on the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave: what are the impacts in Sweden, USA, France and Colombia.","ResumeCombined with sanitation and social distancing measures, control of human mobility has quickly been targeted as a major leverage to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a great majority of countries worldwide. The extent to which such measures were successful, however, is uncertain (Gibbs et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020). Very few studies are quantifying the relation between mobility, lockdown strategies and the diffusion of the virus in different countries. Using the anonymised data collected by one of the major social media platforms (Facebook) combined with spatial and temporal Covid-19 data, the objective of this research is to understand how mobility patterns and SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave are connected in four different countries: the west coast of the USA, Colombia, Sweden and France. Our analyses suggest a relatively modest impact of lockdown on the spread of the virus at the national scale. Despite a varying impact of lockdown on mobility reduction in these countries (83% in France and Colombia, 55% in USA, 10% in Sweden), no country successfully implemented control measures to stem the spread of the virus. As observed in Hubei (Chinazzi et al. 2020), it is likely that the virus had already spread very widely prior to lockdown; the number of affected administrative units in all countries was already very high at the time of lockdown despite the low testing levels. The second conclusion is that the integration of mobility data considerably improved the epidemiological model (as revealed by the QAIC). If inter-individual contact is a fundamental element in the study of the spread of infectious diseases, it is also the case at the level of administrative units. However, this relational dimension is little understood beyond the individual scale mostly due to the lack of mobility data at this scale. Fortunately, these types of data are getting increasingly provided by social media or mobile operators, and they can be used to help administrations to observe changes in movement patterns and/or to better locate where to implement disease control measures such as vaccination (Pollina & Busvine 2020; Pullano et al. 2020; Romm et al. 2020).",Olivier Telle; Samuel Benkimoun; Richard E.

345,"ABC2-SPH risk score for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients: development, external validation and comparison with other available scores","ObjectiveTo develop and validate a rapid scoring system at hospital admission for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and to compare this score with other existing ones.

DesignCohort study

SettingThe Brazilian COVID-19 Registry has been conducted in 36 Brazilian hospitals in 17 cities. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a prediction model for in-hospital mortality, based on the 3978 patients that were admitted between March-July, 2020. The model was then validated in the 1054 patients admitted during August-September, as well as in an external cohort of 474 Spanish patients.

ParticipantsConsecutive symptomatic patients ([&ge;]18 years old) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted to participating hospitals. Patients who were transferred between hospitals and in whom admission data from the first hospital or the last hospital were not available were excluded, as well those who were admitted for other reasons and developed COVID-19 symptoms during their stay.

Main outcome measuresIn-hospital mortality

ResultsMedian (25th-75th percentile) age of the model-derivation cohort was 60 (48-72) years, 53.8% were men, in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. The validation cohorts had similar age distribution and in-hospital mortality. From 20 potential predictors, seven significant variables were included in the in-hospital mortality risk score: age, blood urea nitrogen, number of comorbidities, C-reactive protein, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count and heart rate. The model had high discriminatory value (AUROC 0.844, 95% CI 0.829 to 0.859), which was confirmed in the Brazilian (0.859) and Spanish (0.899) validation cohorts. Our ABC2-SPH score showed good calibration in both Brazilian cohorts, but, in the Spanish cohort, mortality was somewhat underestimated in patients with very high (>25%) risk. The ABC2-SPH score is implemented in a freely available online risk calculator (https://abc2sph.com/).

ConclusionsWe designed and validated an easy-to-use rapid scoring system based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients commonly available at hospital presentation, for early stratification for in-hospital mortality risk of patients with COVID-19.

346,A Rapid Realist Review of the Role of Community Pharmacy in the Public Health Response to COVID-19,"IntroductionCommunity pharmacists and their teams have remained accessible to the public providing essential services despite immense pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out.

AimThis rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future.

MethodAn embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data was extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics, and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations.

ResultsThe 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy.

DiscussionCommunity pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.",Ian D Maidment; Emma Young; Maura MacPhee; Andrew Booth; Hadar Zaman; Juanita Breen; Andrea Hilton; Tony Kelly; Geoff Wong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250765,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250765,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
347,Increased circulating levels of angiotensin-(1-7) in severely ill COVID-19 patients,"The mono-carboxypeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important ""player"" of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It has been hypothesized that following SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 internalization Ang II level would increase in parallel to a decrease of Ang-(1-7) in COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary report, we analyzed the plasma levels of angiotensin peptides in 19 severe COVID-19 patients and 19 non-COVID-19 volunteers, to assess potential outcome associations. Unexpectedly, a significant increase in circulating Ang-(1-7) and lower Ang II plasma level were found in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, an increased Ang-(1-7)/ Ang II ratio was observed in COVID-19 suggesting a RAS dysregulation toward an increased formation of Ang-(1-7) in these patients.",Ana Luisa Valle Martins; Filipe Alex Silva; Lucas Bolais Ramos; Renata Cunha Ribeiro; Filippo Annoni; Alexandre Cardoso; Gisele Capanema Oliveira; Juliana Carvalho Martins; Daisy Motta Santos; Bruna Zivianni; Maria Jose Campagnole-Santos; Danilo Augusto Alves Pereira; Fabio Silvio Taccone; Thiago Verano Braga; Robson A S Santos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.20232785,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.20232785,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
348,Estimating the effectiveness of the Pfizer COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine after a single dose. A reanalysis of a study of 'real-world' vaccination outcomes from Israel.,"A distinctive feature of the roll out of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the UK was the decision to delay the timing of the second injection till 12 weeks after the first. The logic behind this is to protect more people sooner and so reduce the total number of severe infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. This decision caused criticism from some quarters due in part to a belief that a single injection may not give adequate immunity. A recent paper based on Israels experience of vaccination suggested that a single dose may not provide adequate protection. Here we extract the primary data from the Israeli paper and then estimate the incidence per day for each day after the first injection and also estimate vaccine effectiveness for each day from day 13 to day 24. We used a pooled estimate of the daily incidence rate during days 1 to 12 as the counterfactual estimate of incidence without disease and estimated confidence intervals using Monte Carlo modelling. After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off. The cause of the initial surge in infection risk is unknown but may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection. What our analysis shows is that a single dose of vaccine is highly protective, although it can take up to 21 days to achieve this. The early results coming from Israel support the UK policy of extending the gap between doses by showing that a single dose can give a high level of protection.",Paul R Hunter; Julii Suzanne Brainard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250957,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250957,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
349,COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters before and after pub lockdown,"AimTo study how different bans on serving alcohol in Norwegian bars and restaurants were related to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in bartenders and waiters.

MethodsIn 24,276 bartenders and waiters and 1,287,970 persons with other occupations (mean [SD] age 41.7 [12.8] years and 51.7% men), we examined the weekly rates of workers tested and detected with SARS-CoV-2, one to five weeks before and one to five weeks after implementation of different degrees of bans on serving alcohol in pubs and restaurants, across 56 Norwegian municipalities with: 1) full blanket ban, 2) partial ban with hourly restrictions (e.g. from 10 pm), or 3) no ban, adjusted for age, sex and testing behavior.

ResultsIn municipalities introducing full ban, COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters had been reduced by 65% by three weeks (from 3.4 [95%CI=2.5-4.3] to 1.2 [95%CI=0.7-1.7] per 1000), i.e. to the same levels as that for persons with other occupations (1.8 [95%CI=1.7-1.9] vs 1.2 [95%CI=1.1-1.3] per 1000). Similarly, in municipalities introducing partial ban, COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters had been reduced by 68% by three weeks (from 2.5 [95%CI=1.4-3.6] to 0.8 [95%CI=0.0-1.5] per 1000). However, there was more uncertainty to the estimated reduction for partial bans.

ConclusionMunicipalities with higher levels of confirmed COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters implemented stricter bans on serving of alcohol than other municipalities.

350,"Sarilumab treatment of hospitalised patients with severe or critical COVID-19: a multinational, randomised, adaptive, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BackgroundElevated proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity. We assessed efficacy and safety of sarilumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in severe (requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal canula or face mask) or critical (requiring greater supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal support) COVID-19.

MethodsThis was a 60-day, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial in patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pneumonia, who required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Patients were randomised 2:2:1 to intravenous sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to [&ge;]2-point clinical improvement (7-point scale; range: 1 [death] to 7 [not hospitalised]). The key secondary endpoint was proportion of patients alive at day 29. Safety outcomes included adverse events and laboratory assessments. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04327388).

FindingsBetween March 28 and July 3, 2020, 420 patients were randomised; 416 received treatment (placebo, n=84; sarilumab 200 mg, n=159; sarilumab 400 mg, n=173). At day 29, there were no significant differences in median (95% CI) time to [&ge;]2-point improvement between placebo (12{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-15{middle dot}0] days) and sarilumab groups (200 mg: 10{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-12{middle dot}0] days, p=0.96, log-rank test; 400 mg: 10{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-13{middle dot}0] days, p=0.34) or in proportions of patients alive (placebo, 91{middle dot}7%; sarilumab 200 mg, 89{middle dot}9%, p=0{middle dot}63; sarilumab 400 mg, 91{middle dot}9%, p=0{middle dot}85). At day 29, there were numerical, nonsignificant survival differences between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +9%, 95% CI -7{middle dot}7 to 25{middle dot}5, p=0{middle dot}25) for critical patients. There were no unexpected safety signals.

InterpretationThis trial did not demonstrate efficacy of sarilumab in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and receiving supplemental oxygen. Adequately powered trials of targeted immunomodulatory therapies assessing survival as a primary endpoint are suggested in patients with critical COVID-19.

351,Sex disparities and neutralizing antibody durability to SARS-CoV-2 infection in convalescent individuals,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now caused over 2 million deaths worldwide and continues to expand. Currently, much is unknown about functionally neutralizing human antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2. Using convalescent sera collected from 101 COVID-19 recovered individuals 21-212 days after symptom onset with forty-eight additional longitudinal samples, we measured functionality and durability of serum antibodies. We also evaluated associations between individual demographic and clinical parameters with functional neutralizing antibody responses to COVID-19. We found robust antibody durability out to six months, as well as significant positive associations with the magnitude of the neutralizing antibody response and male sex. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent neutralizing antibodies are higher in individuals with cardio-metabolic comorbidities.

SignificanceIn this study we found that neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19 convalescent individuals vary in magnitude but are durable and correlate well with RBD Ig binding antibody levels compared to other SARS-CoV-2 antigen responses. In our cohort, higher neutralizing antibody titers are independently and significantly associated with male sex compared to female sex. We also show for the first time, that higher convalescent antibody titers in male donors are associated with increased age and symptom grade. Furthermore, cardio-metabolic co-morbidities are associated with higher antibody titers independently of sex. Here, we present an in-depth evaluation of serologic, demographic, and clinical correlates of functional antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2.",Alena Janda Markmann; Natasa Gaillourou; D.

352,Vaccinating Australia: How long will it take?,"The Australian Governments COVID-19 vaccine rollout strategy is scheduled to commence in late February 2021 and aims to vaccinate the Australian adult population by the end of October 2021. The task of vaccinating some 20 million people within this timeframe presents considerable logistical challenges. Key to meeting this target is the rate of vaccine delivery: the number of vaccine doses that can be administered per day. In the opening phase, high priority groups will receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through hospital hubs at an initial rate of 80,000 doses per week. However, pending regulatory approval, the currently announced plan appears to be to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine to the bulk of the popluation through a combination of general practices and community pharmacies. Here, we run a series of projections to estimate how long it will take to vaccinate the Australian population under different assumptions about the rate of vaccine administration as well as the schedule for second doses and prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis highlights the ambitious rate of vaccine administration that will be neccessary to meet the Australian Government completion target of October 2021. A rate of 200,000 doses per day would comfortably meet that target; 80,000 doses a day would see roll-out extended until mid-2022. Speed is of the essence when it comes to vaccine rollout: protecting the population quickly will minimise the risk of sporadic and costly lockdowns lockdowns and the potential for small, local clusters getting out of control and sparking new epidemic waves. The government should gather all its resources to maximise the daily vaccination rate, ideally aiming to ramp up administration to at least 200,000 doses per day as quickly as possible. Quickly achieving and maintaining this pace will likely require dedicated large-scale vaccination sites that are capable of delivering thousands of doses a week in addition to the enthusiastic participation of GP practices and community pharmacies around the country. Lessons on the neccessary logistical planning, including coordination of delivery, ultra-cold-chain storage and staffing, can potentially be learned from Israel, where between 7,000 and 20,000 vaccinations per million population have been delivered daily throughout January.",Mark J Hanly; Tim Churches; Oisin Fitzgerald; Chandini Raina MacIntyre; Louisa Jorm,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250979,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250979,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
353,Increased hazard of death in community-tested cases of SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01,"VOC 202012/01, a SARS-CoV-2 variant first detected in the United Kingdom in September 2020, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that this novel variant is more transmissible than preexisting variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity. We analyse a large database of SARS-CoV-2 community test results and COVID-19 deaths, representing 52% of all SARS-CoV-2 community tests in England from 1 September 2020 to 5 February 2021. This subset of SARS-CoV-2 tests can identify VOC 202012/01 because mutations in this lineage prevent PCR amplification of the spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF). We estimate that the hazard of death among SGTF cases is 58% (95% CI 40-79%) higher than among non-SGTF cases after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation level, care home residence, local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a male aged 55-69 increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% CI 0.8-1.0%) over the 28 days following a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate a 71% (48-97%) higher hazard of death associated with VOC 202012/01. Our analysis suggests that VOC 202012/01 is not only more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants but may also cause more severe illness.",Nicholas G Davies; Christopher I Jarvis; - CMMID COVID-19 Working Group; W.

354,Epidemiological and evolutionary considerations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dosing regimes,"As the threat of Covid-19 continues and in the face of vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels. How timing of delivery of the second dose affects infection burden but also prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape are critical questions. Both hinge on the strength and duration (i.e. robustness) of the immune response elicited by a single dose, compared to natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short-term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection, evaluating how different second dose delays might drive immune escape via a build-up of partially immune individuals. Under certain scenarios, we find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose, and to ramp up vaccination efforts throughout the world.",Chadi M. Saad-Roy; Sinead E.

355,Changes in Characteristics of Opioid Overdose Death Trends during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background and AimsThere are limited reports analyzing opioid overdose (OD) mortality data during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also great heterogeneity in outcomes across states, necessitating assessments of the effects of COVID-19 on OD deaths on a state-by-state level. This report aims to analyze overall trends in OD deaths in Massachusetts during COVID-19.

DesignUsing individual-level death records in Massachusetts, we identified and analyzed OD mortality trends during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 2018 and 2019. We analyzed the period between March 24 (stay-at-home order in 2020) and August 11 (latest reliable data). We also estimated the correlation between OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates at the county level.

SettingMassachusetts.

ParticipantsA total of 2,342 OD deaths were analyzed.

MeasurementsThe outcomes studied were OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates.

FindingsOD deaths involving cocaine and amphetamines increased from 2019 to 2020, by 20% (276 vs. 330; P<0.01) and 79% (33 vs. 59; P<0.01), respectively, but were steady from 2018 to 2019. Heroins presence continued to decrease (238 in 2018, 161 in 2019, 102 in 2020; P<0.001); however, fentanyl was present in more than 90% of OD deaths, reflecting its continued domination of the illicit opioid supply in Massachusetts. Prescription opioid presence was stable. 79% of OD decedents were White and 6% were Black in 2019, as compared to 74% and 10% in 2020 (P=0.01). We found no significant correlation between COVID-19 case fatality and OD death rates.

ConclusionsIncreased deaths involving stimulants and alcohol reflect concerning trends in the era of COVID-19. Rising OD death rates among Black residents underscore that interventions focused on racial equity are necessary.

356,Microscopic dynamics modeling unravels the role of asymptomatic virus carriers in SARS-CoV-2 epidemics at the interplay between biological and social factors,"The recent experience of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics spreading revealed the importance of passive forms of infection transmissions. Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modelling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and to unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes. The model accounts for each human actors susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.",Bosiljka Tadic; Roderick Melnik,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250926,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250926,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
357,Multi-modality detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal donor samples for transplantation and in asymptomatic emergency surgical admissions,"IntroductionFaecal transplantation is an evidence based treatment for Clostridiodes difficile. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to shed the virus in stool for up to 33 days, well beyond the average clearance time for upper respiratory tract shedding. We carried out an analytical and clinical validation of reverse-transcriptase quantitative (RT-qPCR) as well as LAMP, LamPORE and droplet digital PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool from donated samples for FMT, spiked samples and asymptomatic inpatients in an acute surgical unit.

MethodsKilled SARS-CoV-2 viral lysate and extracted RNA was spiked into donor stool & FMT and a linear dilution series from 10-1 to 10-5 and tested via RT-qPCR, LAMP, LamPORE and ddPCR against SARS-CoV-2. Patients admitted to the critical care unit with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and sequential asymptomatic patients from acute presentation to an acute surgical unit were also tested.

ResultsIn a linear dilution series, detection of the lowest dilution series was found to be 8 copies per microlitre of sample. Spiked lysate samples down to 10-2 dilution were detected in FMT samples using RTQPCR, LamPORE and ddPCR and down to 10-1 with LAMP. In symptomatic patients 5/12 had detectable SARS-CoV-2 in stool via RT-qPCR and 6/12 via LamPORE, and in 1/97 asymptomatic patients via RT-qPCR.

ConclusionsRT-qPCR can be detected in FMT donor samples using RT-qPCR, LamPORE and ddPCR to low levels using validated pathways.

358,SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the healthcare setting into the home: a prospective longitudinal cohort study,"ObjectiveTo assess the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in healthcare workers and subsequent transmission to their close contacts within their household. To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in exposed participants.

SettingTwo acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of England.

BackgroundThe UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current literature.

MethodsHealthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs.

Results633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%).

7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50[&ge;]1/300; no cohabitee achieved this level..

ConclusionsTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce viral transmission from hospitals to the community.

SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSSection 1: What is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIHealthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population due, at least in part, to high levels of occupational exposure.
C_LIO_LIIgA, IgM and IgG are detectable for most patients after 11 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection but all decline in the weeks following SAR-CoV-2 exposure.
C_LIO_LIRates of transmission to healthcare workers, and therefore subsequent transmission to their close contacts, may be reduced with effective PPE.

Section 2: What this study addsO_LIThe amount of neutralising antibodies formed may be dependent on IgG response as it is much lower among seropositive cohabitees than seropositive healthcare workers.
C_LIO_LINHS Healthcare workers had a far greater seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LICohabitees of positive healthcare workers have a 6-fold increased risk of developing serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LIDespite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community.

Research into contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for articles published between January 1 2020 and January 27, 2021 with the terms ""Covid-19"", ""healthcare workers"", and ""transmission"" ""home {NOT nursing} or household"". We did not restrict our search by language or type of publication. We identified 38 studies of which only one assessed the prevalence among HCW households using Canadian national databases. Our PubMed search yielded only one serological study within the German Healthcare system, which suggested very low transmission from healthcare workers to their close cohabitees.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal serological cohort study assessing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the UK healthcare environment to the home (n = 633 healthcare workers, 178 cohabitees). Our findings showed that serological evidence within the HCW was high with 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. A cohabitee of a seropositive HCW had a six-fold increase of being seropositive themselves compared to a baseline rate of 2.5%. Despite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

Implications of all available evidenceUnderstanding the transmission during the first wave from the healthcare setting into the home and the extent of such transmissions is essential to understand containment strategies of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants or to understand viral transmission of future respiratory viruses. NHS workers appeared to be at an increased risk of contracting of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the HCWs of other nations; we hypothesise that this may be related to a scarcity of appropriate personal protective equipment during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population. An infected HCW, whether symptomatic or not, appears to be a significant bridge for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to their close home contacts.",Simon Craxford; Jessica Nightingale; Adeel Ikram; Ben Arthur Marson; Anthony Kelly; Alan Norrish; Amrita Vijay; Stuart Astbury; Lola Cusin; Waheed Ashraf; Jayne Newham; Guruprasad Aithal; Patrick Tighe; Jonathan Ball; Alexander W Tarr; Richard A Urbanowicz; Ana Valdes; Benjamin Ollivere,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250950,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250950,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
359,Inference on the dynamics of the COVID pandemic from observational data,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe describe a time dependent stochastic dynamic model in discrete time for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in various states of USA. The proposed multi-compartment model is expressed through a system of difference equations that describe their temporal dynamics. Various compartments in our model is connected to the social distancing measures and diagnostic testing rates. A nonparametric estimation strategy is employed for obtaining estimates of interpretable temporally static and dynamic epidemiological rate parameters. The confidence bands of the parameters are obtained using a residual bootstrap procedure. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to estimate latent compartments such as the trajectory of the number of asymptomatic but infected individuals which are the key vectors of COVID-19 spread. The nature of the disease dynamics is further quantified by the proposed epidemiological markers, which use estimates of such key latent compartments.",Satarupa Bhattacharjee; Shuting Liao; Debashis Paul; Sanjay Chaudhuri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250936,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250936,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
360,"Evaluation of Depression, Anxiety and Sleep Quality in the Brazilian Population During Social Isolation Due to the New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: the DEGAS-CoV Study","IntroductionThe new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has caused distress and repercussions in mental and physical health of individuals. Depression, anxiety and worsening of sleep quality have been reported in several recent articles that surveyed populations all over the globe. Our work meant to access, through a cross-sectional study, these disorders in the Brazilian population, through the application of an online questionnaire conducted on the second trimester of 2020.

Materials and MethodsWe applied an online questionnaire, filled with questions regarding social, economic, financial, educational and health status, as well as questions from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), and from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

ResultsWe collected 2,695 valid answers, from April 24th to May 31st, 2020. Age ranged from 18 to 79 years, mean of 31.3. Women were 76.3%, men 23.7%. Symptoms of Anxiety were found in 56.5%, of depression in 46.1%, and of bad sleep in 49.2%. Some groups were more prone than others to one or more of those conditions, such as: younger people, women, mestizos, Northeasterners, people with lesser years of education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic, caregivers, students, sedentary or people practicing less physical activity, people who followed more hours of news of COVID-19 and those less engaged in social and instrumental activities.

Conclusionanxiety, depression and bad sleep quality were significantly high in our survey. Mental and sleep health is heterogeneously affected among individuals, depending on social, economic, financial, educational and health status.

O_TEXTBOXHIGHLIGHTS

- An online survey (DEGAS-CoV) was conducted between April 30th and May 31st, 2020, with people living in Brazil, aged 18 or more. The study obtained 2,695 valid answers.
- Rates of possible anxiety, possible depression and bad sleep quality were 56.5%, 46.1% and 49.2%, respectively. Rates are similar to another Brazilian survey, with 45,161 participants, conducted in a similar time window.
- Were more prone to mental and/or sleep conditions: younger participants, women, mestizos, unemployed, students, people with less years of education, people with lower income or with considerable drops of income during the virus outbreak, caregivers, people who followed more news of COVID-19, people less engaged in social and instrumental activities, smokers, sedentary or those who practiced less physical activity, and people who had symptoms suspected (confirmed or not) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Alcohol drinkers were slightly less likely to be possibly depressed. That finding needs more clarification and may be due to confounders.

361,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and associated outcomes: results from an ongoing prospective cohort study, New York City","BackgroundIn May-July 2020 in the New York City area, up to 16% of pregnant women had reportedly been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies found associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and certain adverse outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, cesarean delivery). These studies relied on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection. This led to overrepresentation of symptomatic or acutely ill cases in scientific studies.

ObjectiveTo expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology and stage of infection, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels.

Study DesignThe Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant women receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai West Hospital from April 20, 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before August 15, 2020. Blood was drawn as part of routine clinical care; for each woman, we tested the latest sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labor and delivery. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, Apgar score, ICU/NICU admission, and neonatal hospital length of stay) and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Among all Generation C participants who had given birth by August 15, 2020 (n=708), we established the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Excluding women who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models to compare antibody positive women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery with antibody negative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification.

ResultsThe SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4% (n=116, 95% CI 13.7-19.3). Twelve women (1.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery (11 of these women were seropositive). Seropositive women were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative women. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity without RT-PCR positivity at delivery was associated with decreased odds of caesarean delivery (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.27; 0.84) compared with seronegative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. Stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between seropositivity and decreased odds of caesarean delivery remained for non-Hispanic Black/African-American and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic White women. No other pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity.

ConclusionSeropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery, suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy, was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample of women from New York City. While non-Hispanic Black and Latina women in our cohort had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared with non-Hispanic White women, we found no increase in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among these groups due to infection.",Nina M Molenaar; Anna-Sophie Rommel; Lotje de Witte; Siobhan Dolan; Whitney Lieb; Erona Ibroci; Sophie Ohrn; Jezelle Lynch; Christina Capuano; Daniel Stadlbauer; Florian Krammer; Lauren Zapata; Rachel Brody; Rhoda Sperling; Omara Afzal; Roy Missall; Amy Balbierz; Teresa Janevic; Joanne Stone; Elizabeth Howell; Veerle Bergink,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250943,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
362,"Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 on college campuses: Initial efforts, lessons learned and research needs","BackgroundWastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging approach to help identify the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. This tool can contribute to public health surveillance at both community (wastewater treatment system) and institutional (e.g., colleges, prisons, nursing homes) scales.

ObjectivesThis research aims to understand the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from initial wastewater surveillance efforts at colleges and university systems to inform future research, development and implementation.

MethodsThis paper presents the experiences of 25 college and university systems in the United States that monitored campus wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 during the fall 2020 academic period. We describe the broad range of approaches, findings, resource needs, and lessons learned from these initial efforts. These institutions range in size, social and political geographies, and include both public and private institutions.

DiscussionOur analysis suggests that wastewater monitoring at colleges requires consideration of information needs, local sewage infrastructure, resources for sampling and analysis, college and community dynamics, approaches to interpretation and communication of results, and follow-up actions. Most colleges reported that a learning process of experimentation, evaluation, and adaptation was key to progress. This process requires ongoing collaboration among diverse stakeholders including decision-makers, researchers, faculty, facilities staff, students, and community members.",Sasha Harris-Lovett; Kara L Nelson; Paloma Beamer; Heather N Bischel; Aaron Bivins; Andrea Bruder; Caitlyn Butler; Todd D.

363,"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in Monterey County, California","ImportanceEssential workers in agriculture and food production have been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding and antibody response in farmworkers in California.

DesignThis cross-sectional study collected survey data and determined current SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seropositivity among 1,107 farmworkers in Californias Salinas Valley from 16 July to 30 November 2020.

SettingFarmworkers receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites were invited to participate in our study.

ParticipantsIndividuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, [&ge;]18 years old, had conducted farm work since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish.

ExposuresSociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Current (as indicated by TMA positivity) and historical (as indicated by IgG seropositivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsMost farmworkers enrolled in the study were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels of educational attainment, and were overweight or obese. Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.99-1.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60; 1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24). Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection.

364,"Scientists' opinion, attitudes, and consensus towards immunity passports","ObjectivesWe measured attitudes towards ""immunity passports"" in the context of COVID-19 of a large sample of scientists. Consensus of scientists opinions on a different aspect of immunity passports was assessed.

MethodsWe designed and implemented a survey to capture what scientists from around the world and different scientific background think about immunity certification. The survey was sent to the corresponding authors of scholarly articles published in the last five years in the top 20-ranked journals in each of the 27 subject areas between May and June 2020. Responses from 12,738 scientists were captured, and their distribution was tabulated by participants in health science and other fields. Consensus of responses was calculated using a variant of Shannon Entropy, made suitable for the ordinal response variables.

ResultsHalf of the scientists surveyed, regardless of academic background agree that a potential immunity passport program will be good for public health (50.2%) and the economy (54.4%), with 19.1% and 15.4% of participants disagree, respectively. A significant proportion of scientists raised concerns about immunity certification over fairness to others (36.5%) and social inequality (45.5%). There is little consensus in the different aspects of immunity passport among scientists. Overall, scientists with health background hold a more conservative view towards immunity certification.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest a lack of general agreement regarding the potential health and economic benefits, societal costs, and ethical issues of an immunity certification program within the scientific community. Given the relevant and important implications of immunity passport due to the increasing vaccine availability and efficacy, more attention should be given to the discussion of the design and implementation of immunity certification program.

366,SEVERE COVID-19 IS MARKED BY DYSREGULATED SERUM LEVELS OF CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A3 AND SEROTONIN,"The immune response plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from protection to tissue damage. This is observed in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome when elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines are detected. Several cells of the immune response are implied in this dysregulated immune response including innate immune cells and T and B cell lymphocytes. Mast cells are abundant resident cells of the respiratory tract, able to rapidly release different inflammatory mediators following stimulation. Recently, mast cells have been associated with tissue damage during viral infections, but little is known about their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We noticed that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3), and decreased serotonin levels in their serum. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, while serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that mast cells are relevant players in the inflammatory response in COVID-19, might represent targets for therapeutic intervention.",Rodolfo Soria-Castro; Yatsiri G.

367,Colchicine use in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionColchicine may inhibit inflammasome signaling and reduce proinflammatory cytokines, a purported mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to report on the state of the current literature on the use of colchicine in COVID-19 and to investigate the reported clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients by colchicine usage.

MethodsThe literature was searched from January 2019 through January 28, 2021. References were screened to identify studies that reported the effect of colchicine usage on COVID-19 outcomes including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, or mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroup of trial design (RCT vs observational) and ICU status. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsSix studies, reporting on 5,033 patients, were included in this review. Across the six studies, COVID-19 patients who had colchicine had a lower risk of mortality - HR of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.66) and OR of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.76). Among the three observational studies, COVID-19 patients who received colchicine had a lower risk of mortality - HR of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.66) and OR of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.71). Among three randomized controlled trials, the summary point estimate suggests a direction toward benefit in mortality that is not statistically significant among patients receiving colchicine versus placebo- OR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.20, 1.24).

368,Deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human pancreatic cells,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 46 million people worldwide and caused more than 1.2 million deaths. It is transmitted by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and affects the respiratory tract as well as extra-pulmonary systems, including the pancreas, that express the virus entry receptor, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Importantly, the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, the latter composed of ductal and acinar cells, express high levels of ACE2, which correlates to impaired functionality characterized as acute pancreatitis observed in some cases presenting with COVID-19. Since acute pancreatitis is already one of the most frequent gastrointestinal causes of hospitalization in the U.S. and the majority of studies investigating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas are clinical and observational, we utilized human iPSC technology to investigate the potential deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures containing endocrine and exocrine cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting iPSC-derived pancreatic cells, thus perturbing their normal molecular and cellular phenotypes. The infection increased a key inflammatory cytokine, CXCL12, known to be involved in pancreas dysfunction. Transcriptome analysis of infected pancreatic cultures confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the ribosomal machinery in these cells. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the pancreas is confirmed in post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients, which showed co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells and increased the expression of some pancreatic ductal stress response genes. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human iPSC-derived pancreatic cells with supporting evidence of presence of the virus in post-mortem pancreatic tissue of confirmed COVID-19 human cases. This novel model of iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures will open new avenues for the comprehension of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially establish a platform for endocrine and exocrine pancreas-specific antiviral drug screening.",Syairah Hanan Shaharuddin; Victoria L Wang; Roberta DeSouza Santos; Yizhou Wang; Harneet Jawanda; Yi Zhang; Wohaib Hasan; Gustavo L Garcia; Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami; Dhruv Sareen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250846,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250846,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

370,Rapid vaccination and early reactive partial lockdown will minimize deaths from emerging highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants,"The goals of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs are to maximally reduce cases and deaths, and to limit the amount of time required under lockdown. Using a mathematical model calibrated to data from King County Washington but generalizable across states, we simulated multiple scenarios with different vaccine efficacy profiles, vaccination rates, and case thresholds for triggering and relaxing partial lockdowns. We assumed that a contagious variant is currently present at low levels. In all scenarios, it rapidly becomes dominant by early summer. Low case thresholds for triggering partial lockdowns during current and future waves of infection strongly predict lower total numbers of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in 2021. However, in regions with relatively higher current seroprevalence, there is a predicted delay in onset of a subsequent surge in new variant infections. For all vaccine efficacy profiles, increasing vaccination rate lowers the total number of infections and deaths, as well as the total number of days under partial lockdown. Due to variable current estimates of emerging variant infectiousness, vaccine efficacy against these variants, vaccine refusal, and future adherence to masking and physical distancing, we project considerable uncertainty regarding the timing and intensity of subsequent waves of infection. Nevertheless, under all plausible scenarios, rapid vaccination and early implementation of partial lockdown are the two most critical variables to save the greatest number of lives.",Daniel B Reeves; Chloe Bracis; David A Swan; Mia Moore; Dobromir Dimitrov; Joshua T Schiffer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250985,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250985,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
371,Extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a strictly-Orthodox Jewish community in the UK,"BackgroundEthnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community.

MethodsWe performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres.

FindingsA total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres.

InterpretationIn this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSIn January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", seroprevalence, ""ethnic minority"", and ""Jewish"" with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups.

Added value of the studyWe report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults.

Implications of the available evidenceOur data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.",Katherine M Gaskell; Marina Johnson; Victoria Gould; Adam Hunt; Neil RH Stone; William Waites; Ben Kasstan; Tracey Chantler; Sham Lal; Chrissy h.

372,Effect of co-infection with parasites on severity of COVID-19,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a spectrum of clinical presentations. The effect of co-infection with parasites on the clinical features of COVID-19 is unknown.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled consecutive COVID-19 patients and screened them for intestinal parasitic infections. Patients were followed during hospitalization for clinical outcomes. Patients with parasitic co-infection were compared to those without parasitic co-infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed severe disease. Factors associated with the development of severe disease were determined by logistic regression.

ResultsA total of 515 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for intestinal parasites, of whom 267 (51.8%) were co-infected with one or more parasites. Parasitic co-infection correlated inversely with COVID-19 severity. Severe COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients without parasites [47/248 (19.0%, CI: 14.52-24.35)] than in those with parasites [21/267 (7.9%, CI: 5.17-11.79)]; p<0.0001. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who developed severe COVID-19 in the non-protozoa group [56/369 (15.2%, CI: 11.85-19.23)] as compared to the protozoa group [12/146 (8.2%, CI: 4.70-14.00)]; p=0.036. Significant higher proportion of the patients presented at baseline with severe COVID-19 in the helminth negative group [57/341 (16.7%, CI: 13.10 - 21.08)] than in the group with pre-existing helminth infection [11/174 (6.3%, CI: 3.51 - 11.11)]; p=0.001. In addition, after adjustment for age and presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.77); p=0.006], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21-0.98); p=0.044] as well as those with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17-0.80); p=0.011] had lower probability of developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite, protozoa or helminth co-infection.

ConclusionOur results suggest that co-infection with parasitic co-infection appears to be associated with reduced COVID-19 severity. The results suggest that parasite-driven immunomodulatory responses may mute hyperinflammation associated with severe COVID-19.",Teklay Gebrecherkos; Zekarias Gessesse; Yazezew Kebede; Atsbeha Gebreegzabher; Geremew Tassew; Mahmud Abdulkader; Hiluf Ebuy; Abraham Desta; Atakilti Hailu; Vanessa Harris; Tobias Rinke de Wit; Dawit Wolday,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250995,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250995,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
373,The role of the SwissCovid digital contact tracing app during the pandemic response: results for the Canton of Zurich,"ImportanceDigital proximity tracing (DPT) apps were released in several countries to help interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains in the population. However, the impact of DPT on pandemic mitigation still remains to be demonstrated.

ObjectiveTo estimate key populations and performance indicators along the DPT app notification cascade in a clearly defined regional (Canton of Zurich, using all of Switzerland as a comparison) and temporal context (September/October 2020).

DesignPublicly available administrative and research data, including key DPT performance indicators, SARS-CoV-2 testing statistics, infoline call statistics, and observational study data, were compiled. A model of the DPT notification cascade was developed and key performance indicators for DPT processes were defined. Subpopulation sizes at each cascade step were estimated using data triangulation. Resulting estimates were systematically checked for internal consistency and consistency with other up- or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic simulations were performed to explore robustness of results.

ResultsFor the Canton of Zurich, we estimate that 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in September 2020, of whom 324 received and entered a CovidCode. This triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 proximity contacts and led to 722 infoline calls. In total, 170 callers received a quarantine recommendation, and 30 app users tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after an app notification, reflecting a performance above the national level.

Based on this quantification, key performance indicators were evaluated. For September 2020, these analyses suggest that SwissCovid triggered quarantine recommendations in the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. Per 11 CovidCodes entered in the app, we estimate that almost 1 contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon app notification.

However, longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrate bottlenecks in the notification cascade, as capacity limits were reached due to large increases in SARS-CoV-2 incidence in October 2020.

ConclusionAlthough requiring confirmation, our estimations on the number of notified proximity contacts receiving quarantine recommendations or testing positive after notification suggest relevant contributions to mitigating the pandemic. Increasing SwissCovid app uptake and improving notification cascade performance may further enhance its impact.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the real-life impact of Digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps on interrupting SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains?

FindingsThis data-informed simulation study found that, in the canton of Zurich, the number of app notified persons receiving a quarantine recommendation corresponds to the equivalent of up to 5% of all mandatory quarantined contacts identified by manual contact tracing. Furthermore, about 1 in 11 notification triggers led to SARS-CoV-2 testing of an exposed proximity contact who was consecutively tested positive.

374,A cautionary note on recall vaccination in ex-COVID-19 subjects,"Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA or adenovirus require a first jab followed by recall immunization. There is no indication as to whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 should be vaccinated, and if so, if they should receive one or two vaccine doses. Here, we tested the antibody response developed after the first dose of the mRNA based vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (BNT162b2) in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of COVID-19 (ExCOVID). Post-vaccine antibodies in ExCOVID individuals increase exponentially within 7-15 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (p<0.0001). We developed a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model with l2 regularization to predict the IgG response for SARS-COV-2 vaccine. We found that the antibody response of ExCOVID patients depends on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the symptoms that they developed during the disorder, with anosmia/dysgeusia and gastrointestinal disorders being the most significantly positively correlated in the LR. Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient to induce a good antibody response in ExCOVID subjects. On the contrary, a second dose might switch-off the immune response due to antigen exhaustion, which occurs in response to several viruses or drive the development of low-affinity antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 which may foster an antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) reaction when re-exposed to the virus. These results question whether a second shot in ExCOVID subjects is indeed required and suggest to post-pone it while monitoring antibody response longevity.",Riccardo Levi; Elena Azzolini; Chiara Pozzi; Leonardo Ubaldi; Michele Lagioia; Alberto Mantovani; Maria Rescigno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250923,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250923,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
375,First indication of the effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on the course of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel,"Concomitantly with rolling out its rapid COVID-19 vaccine program, Israel is experiencing its third, and so far largest, surge in morbidity. We aimed to estimate whether the high vaccine coverage among individuals aged over 60 years old creates an observable change in disease dynamics. Using observed and simulated data, we suggest that the shape of the outbreak as measured by daily new moderate and severe cases, and in particular of patients aged over 60, has changed because of vaccination, bringing the decline in new moderate and severe cases earlier than expected, by about a week. Our analyses is consistent with the assumption that vaccination lead to higher than 50% protection in preventing clinical disease and with at least some effectiveness in blocking transmission of elderly population, and supports the importance of prioritizing vulnerable population. This is the first indication of the effectivity of COVID-19 vaccine in changing the course of an ongoing pandemic outbreak.

One Sentence SummaryWe show, by data analysis and modelling of the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, that the current nationwide outbreak, that had up to 0.1% of the population confirmed daily, is clearly affected by the vaccination program, that reached a coverage of more than 80% among people [&ge;] 60 years old.",Hilla De-Leon; Ronit Calderon-Margalit; Francesco Pederiva; Yinon Ashkenazy; Doron Gazit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250630,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250630,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

377,Association Between Preparedness and Response Measures and COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most disruptive global health threat in a century. We analyzed publicly available data on preparedness capacity, COVID-19 incidence and mortality, governance, and testing. Although other analyses have suggested that preparedness assessments do not correlate with effective pandemic response, we found that testing rates correlate with both COVID-19 incidence and mortality and strongly correlated with country preparedness capacity as measured by the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). There is a statistically significant association between preparedness capacities and COVID-19 case incidence and an independent association between governance and COVID-19 case and mortality rates. Legislation, surveillance, and risk communication capacities were associated with lower COVID-19 case incidence and mortality. Preparedness and governance are independently associated with COVID-19 pandemic severity. Preparedness capacities are not sufficient -- capacity and governance are both critical to pandemic control. Countries must improve public health systems and implement strong government leadership.

378,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms of young people in the Global South: evidence from a four-country cohort study,"ObjectiveTo provide evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of adolescents and young adults who grew up in poverty in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs).

DesignA phone survey implemented August-October 2020 to participants of a population-based cohort study since 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-5 and 2001-2 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We examined associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, as well as structural factors (gender, location, wealth); and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, past household wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems and subjective well-being) measured at younger ages.

SettingA diverse, poverty focused sample, reaching those without mobile phones or internet access.

Participants10,496 individuals were approached, 9,730 participated. Overall, 8,988 individuals were included in this study, 4,610 (51%) male and 4,378 (49%) female. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data.

Main outcome measuresAt least mild anxiety and depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7, [&ge;]5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8, [&ge;]5).

ResultsRates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) [95% CI, 38.63-43.12; (29.49-33.74)], and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) [95% CI, 8.16-10.58; (8.33-10.77)], mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Females were most affected in all countries but Ethiopia. In all countries, pandemic-related stressors were associated with increased rates of anxiety and depression, though with varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent and peer relationships were protective factors for mental health while having a long-term health problem or prior emotional problems were risk factors.

ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health of young people. Mental health support is limited in LMICs and young people have to date been lower priority for COVID-19 interventions.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThe study uses data from adolescents and young adults who grew up in poverty in four LMICs which were diversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore investigating a globally vulnerable, but understudied group both in terms of age and wealth.
C_LIO_LIThis study reaches a broad sample of young people who grew up in poverty, including those without internet or mobile phone access.
C_LIO_LIA key strength is combining a broad range of pandemic-related stressors from survey data on experiences of COVID-19 with previously measured information on longer-term risk and protective factors, therefore contributing to a more complete picture of COVID-19 effects.
C_LIO_LIA limitation of the study is that it does not have a directly comparable pre-COVID baseline for depression/anxiety, however, proxy variables are used as a baseline and the explanatory variables capture dynamics that happened during the pandemic.
C_LIO_LIA further limitation is possible underreporting due to stigma associated with mental health, despite piloting and validation, as well as possible bias in self-reported experiences of pandemic-related stressors due to feelings of anxiety or depression.

A single institution study in the region of Abu Dhabi.,"PurposeTo evaluate diagnostic performance of greyscale and inverted greyscale Chest X-ray (CXR) using Computed Tomography (CT) scan as a gold standard.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, electronic medical records of 120 patients who had valid CXR and High-resolution CT (HRCT) within less than 24 hours after having a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test during the period from May 19 th to May 23 rd 2020 in a single tertiary care center were reviewed.

PA chest radiographs were presented on 2 occasions to 5 radiologists to evaluate the role and appropriateness of greyscale and inverted greyscale chest radiographs (CXR). The images were viewed on high-specification viewing systems using a primary display monitors and compared it to computed tomography (CT) findings for screening and management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

ResultsNinety-six (80%) patients had positive CT findings, 81 (67.5%) had positive grey scale CXR lesions, and 25 (20.8%) had better detection in the inverted grey scale CXR. The CXR sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia was 93.8% (95% CI (86.2% - 98.0%) and the specificity was 48.7% (95% CI (32.4% - 65.2%). The CXR sensitivity of detection of lung lesions was slightly higher in male (95.1% (95% CI (86.3% - 99.0%)) than female (90.0% (95% CI (68.3% - 98.8%)), while the specificity was 48.0% (95% CI (27.8% - 68.7%) and 50.0% (95% CI (23.0% - 77.0%) in males and females, respectively. However, no significant difference was detected in ROC area between men and women.

ConclusionsThe sensitivity of detection of lung lesions of CXR was relatively high, particularly in men. The results of the study support the idea of considering conventional radiographs as an important diagnostic tool in suspected COVID-19 patients especially in healthcare facilities where there is no access to HRCT scans.

HighlightsO_LICXR shows high sensitivity for detecting lung lesions in HRCT confirmed COVID-19 patients.
C_LIO_LIBetter detection of lesions was noted in the inverted grey scale CXR in (20.8%) of cases with positive findings in standard greyscale CXR.

380,Home Food Procurement Impacts Food Security and Diet Quality during COVID-19,"BackgroundHome food procurement (HFP) (i.e. gardening, fishing, foraging, hunting, backyard livestock and canning) have historically been important ways that people obtain food. Recently, some HFP activities have grown (e.g. gardening), while other activities (e.g. hunting) have become less common in the United States. Anecdotally, COVID-19 has sparked an increase in HFP evidenced by increased hunting licenses and shortages in seeds and canning supplies. HFP may have positive benefits for food security and diet quality, though research beyond gardening is especially limited in high-income countries.

MethodsWe examine HFP activities before and since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their relationship to food security and dietary quality using multivariable logit models and matching analysis with a statewide representative survey (n=600) of residents of Vermont, United States.

ResultsWe find 29% of respondent households classified as food insecure since COVID-19, and more prevalence among those experiencing a negative job change since COVID-19, households earning less than $50,000 annually, Hispanic and multi-race respondents. Forty-two percent of respondents engaged in HFP activities; the majority of those gardened, and more than half pursued HFP activities more intensely than before the pandemic. HFP was more common among food insecure households, who were more likely to fish, forage, hunt and have backyard livestock. Respondents who were food insecure, Black, Indigenous, People of Color and/or Hispanic, those with a negative job disruption, and larger households all had greater odds of increased intensity of HFP since COVID-19. HFP were significantly associated with eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables, especially if gardening and canning, while respondents hunting or having backyard livestock were significantly more likely to have higher red meat intake.

ConclusionOverall, these results suggest that HFP activities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be an important safety net for food insecure households, and provide diet quality impacts. Long-term, HFP activities may have important food security and diet quality impacts, as well as conservation implications, which should be more thoroughly explored. Regardless, the increased interest and intensity of HFP demonstrates multiple opportunities for educational and outreach efforts.",Meredith T. Niles; Kristen Brassard Wirkkala; Emily H.

381,Standard and anomalous second waves in the COVID-19 pandemic,"We apply a generalised logistic growth model, with time dependent parameters, to describe the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries that exhibit a second wave of infections. The model parameters vary as a function of time according to a logistic function, whose two extreme values, i.e., for early and late times, characterise the first and second waves, respectively. We show that the theoretical curves are in excellent agreement with the empirical data for all cases considered. The model also allows for predictions about the time of occurrence and relative severity of the second wave, in comparison to the first wave. It is shown furthermore that the COVID-19 second waves can be generically classified in two main types, namely, standard and anomalous second waves, according as to whether the second wave starts well after or still during the first wave, respectively. We have also observed that the standard second waves tend, in their majority, to be more severe than the corresponding first wave, whereas for anomalous second waves the opposite occurs.",Giovani L.

382,Muscle strength is associated with COVID-19 hospitalization in adults 50 years of age and older,"BackgroundWeak muscle strength has been associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Yet, whether individuals with weaker strength are more at risk for hospitalization due to severe COVID-19 is still unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the independent association between muscle strength and COVID-19 hospitalization.

MethodsData from 3600 adults 50 years of age and older were analyzed using logistic models adjusted for several chronic conditions, body mass index, age, and sex. Hand grip strength was repeatedly measured between 2004 and 2017 using a handheld dynamometer. COVID-19 hospitalization during the lockdown was self-reported in summer 2020 and was used an indicator of COVID-19 severity.

ResultsResults showed that higher grip strength was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per increase of 1 SD in grip strength = .64, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = .45-.87, p = .015).

384,CovRadar: Continuously tracking and filtering SARS-CoV-2 mutations for molecular surveillance,"SummaryThe ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of molecular surveillance to understand the evolution of the virus and to monitor and plan the epidemiological responses. Quick analysis, easy visualization and convenient filtering of the latest viral sequences are essential for this purpose. We present CovRadar, a tool for molecular surveillance of the Corona spike protein. The spike protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is used as a target for most vaccine candidates. CovRadar consists of a workflow pipeline and a web application that enable the analysis and visualization of over 250,000 sequences. First, CovRadar extracts the regions of interest using local alignment, then builds a multiple sequence alignment, infers variants, consensus sequences and phylogenetic trees and finally presents the results in an interactive PDF-like app, making reporting fast, easy and flexible.

385,Potent in vitro Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by Hetero-bivalent Alpaca Nanobodies Targeting the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain,"Cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 requires the binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As such, RBD has become the major target for vaccine development, while RBD-specific antibodies are pursued as therapeutics. Here, we report the development and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific VHH/nanobody (Nb) from immunized alpacas. Seven RBD-specific Nbs with high stability were identified using phage display. They bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with affinity KD ranging from 2.6 to 113 nM, and six of them can block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The fusion of the Nbs with IgG1 Fc resulted in homodimers with greatly improved RBD-binding affinities (KD ranging from 72.7 pM to 4.5 nM) and nanomolar RBD-ACE2 blocking abilities. Furthermore, fusion of two Nbs with non-overlapping epitopes resulted in hetero-bivalent Nbs, namely aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with significantly higher RBD binding affinities (KD of 59.2 pM and 0.25 nM) and greatly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The 50% neutralization dose (ND50) of aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7 was 1.22 ng/mL ([~]0.043 nM) and 3.18 ng/mL ([~]0.111 nM), respectively. These high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 blocking Nbs could be further developed into therapeutics as well as diagnosis reagents for COVID-19.

ImportanceTo date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous loss of human life and economic output worldwide. Although a few COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in several countries, the development of effective therapeutics including SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies remains critical. Due to their small size (13-15 kDa), highly solubility and stability, Nbs are particularly well suited for pulmonary delivery and more amenable to engineer into multi-valent formats, compared to the conventional antibody. Here, we report a serial of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nbs isolated from immunized alpaca and two engineered hetero-bivalent Nbs. These potent neutralizing Nbs showed promise as potential therapeutics against COVID-19.",Huan Ma; Weihong Zeng; Xiangzhi Meng; Xiaoxue Huang; Yunru Yang; Dan Zhao; Peigen Zhou; Xiaofang Wang; Changcheng Zhao; Yong Sun; Peihui Wang; Huichao Ou; Xiaowen Hu; Yan Xiang; Tengchuan Jin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429311,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429311,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
386,Protective immune trajectories in early viral containment of non-pneumonic SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The immune system of most SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals limits viral spread to the upper airways without pulmonary involvement. This prevents the development of pneumonic COVID-19. However, the protective immunological responses causative of successful viral containment in the upper airways remain unclear. Here, we combine longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomic profiling, multidimensional flow cytometry, RNA-Seq of FACS-sorted leukocyte subsets and multiplex plasma interferon profiling to uncover temporally resolved protective immune signatures in non-pneumonic and ambulatory SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

We compare host responses in a high-risk patient population infected with SARS-CoV-2 but without pulmonary involvement to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Our data reveal a distinct immunological signature of successful viral containment, characterized by an early prominent interferon stimulated gene (ISG) upregulation across immune cell subsets. In addition, reduced cytotoxic potential of Natural Killer (NK) and T cells, as well as a monocyte phenotype with immune-modulatory potential are hallmarks of protective immunity. Temporal resolution across disease trajectories highlights ISG upregulation as particularly prominent early in the disease and confirms increased expression also in comparison to healthy controls.

We validate this distinct temporal ISG signature by in-depth RNA-seq of FACS-sorted leukocyte subsets in a large prospective ambulatory SARS-CoV-2 infected cohort confirming early and robust ISG upregulation particularly in monocytes and T cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a protective ISG phenotype in patients with successful containment of SARS-CoV-2 infection without progression to COVID-19. This early protective interferon response might be exploited as a therapeutic approach and for disease course prediction.",Kami Pekayvaz; Alexander Leunig; Rainer Kaiser; Sophia Brambs; Markus Joppich; Aleksandar Janjic; Oliver Popp; Vivien Polewka; Lucas Esteban Wange; Christoph Gold; Marieluise Kirchner; Maximilian Muenchhoff; Johannes C.

387,"In silico, in vitro and in cellulo models for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 spike/human ACE2 complex, viral entry and cell fusion","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a novel computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context, and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429555,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429555,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
388,Assessment of immunogenicity and protective efficacy of ZyCoV-D DNA vaccine candidates in Rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Vaccines remain the key protective measure to achieve herd immunity to control the disease burden and stop COVID-19 pandemic. We have developed and assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of two formulations (1mg and 2mg) of ZyCoV-D (a plasmid DNA based vaccine candidates) administered through Needle Free Injection System (NFIS) and syringe-needle (intradermal) in rhesus macaques with three dose vaccine regimens. The vaccine candidate 2mg dose administered using Needle Free Injection System (NFIS) elicited a significant immune response with development of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike region specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers during the immunization phase and significant enhancement in the levels after the virus challenge. In 2 mg NFIS group the IgG and NAb titers were maintained and showed gradual rise during the immunization period (15 weeks) and till 2 weeks after the virus challenge. It also conferred better protection to macaques evident by the viral clearance from nasal swab, throat swab and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens in comparison with macaques from other immunized groups. In contrast, the animals from placebo group developed high levels of viremia and lung disease following the virus challenge. Besides this, the vaccine candidate also induced increase lymphocyte proliferation and cytokines response (IL-6, IL-5).The administration of the vaccine candidate with NFIS generated a better immunogenicity response in comparison to syringe-needle (intradermal route).

389,Identification of the SHREK family of proteins as broad-spectrum host antiviral factors,"Mucins and mucin-like molecules are highly glycosylated, high-molecular-weight cell surface proteins that possess a semi-rigid and highly extended extracellular domain. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a mucin-like glycoprotein, has recently been found to restrict HIV-1 infectivity through virion incorporation that sterically hinders virus particle attachment to target cells. Here, we report the identification of a family of antiviral cellular proteins, named the Surface-Hinged, Rigidly-Extended Killer (SHREK) family of virion inactivators (PSGL-1, CD43, TIM-1, CD34, PODXL1, PODXL2, CD164, MUC1, MUC4, and TMEM123), that share similar structural characteristics with PSGL-1. We demonstrate that SHREK proteins block HIV-1 infectivity by inhibiting virus particle attachment to target cells. In addition, we demonstrate that SHREK proteins are broad-spectrum host antiviral factors that block the infection of diverse viruses such as influenza A. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a subset of SHREKs also blocks the infectivity of a hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle. These results suggest that SHREK proteins may be a part of host innate immunity against enveloped viruses.",Deemah Dabbagh; Sijia He; Brian Hetrick; Linda Chilin; Ali Andalibi; Yuntao Wu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429469,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429469,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False

Here, we demonstrate that a single intranasal administration of a lentiviral vector encoding a prefusion form of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein induces full protection of respiratory tracts and totally avoids pulmonary inflammation in the susceptible hamster model. More importantly, we generated a new transgenic mouse strain, expressing the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2, with unprecedent brain permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication and developing a lethal disease in <4 days post infection. Even though the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is now well established, so far other vaccine strategies under development have not taken into the account the protection of central nervous system. Using our highly stringent transgenic model, we demonstrated that an intranasal booster immunization with the developed lentiviral vaccine candidate achieves full protection of both respiratory tracts and brain against SARS-CoV-2.",Min-Wen Ku; Pierre Authie; Maryline Bourgine; Francois Anna; Amandine Noirat; Fanny Moncoq; Benjamin Vesin; Fabien Nevo; Jodie Lopez; Philippe Souque; Catherine Blanc; Sebastien Chardenoux; Ilta Lafosse; David Hardy; Kirill Nemirov; Francoise Guinet; Francina Langa Vives; Laleh Majlessi; Pierre Charneau,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429211,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429211,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
391,Potential global impact of the N501Y mutation on MHC-II presentation and immune escape,"The B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant, characterized by the N501Y mutation, is rapidly emerging, raising concerns about its effectiveness on natural as well as vaccine-induced adaptive viral immunity at the population level. Since CD4 T cell responses are of critical importance to the antibody response, we examined the global effects of N501Y mutation on MHC-II presentation compared to the N501 wildtype and found poorer presentation across the majority of MHC-II alleles. This suggests that the N501Y mutation may not only diminish binding of antibodies to the RBD but also interfere with their production by weakening the cooperation between T and B cells, facilitating immune escape.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429431,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429431,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
392,Impact of the B.1.1.7 variant on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognizing diverse epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 Spike,"The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the ACE2 receptor on host cells is essential for viral entry. RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To fully understand how these mutations affect the antigenicity of Spike, we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as a sorting bait, we isolated >100 Spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. ~45% showed neutralizing activity of which ~20% were NTD-specific. None of the S2-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed that NTD-specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes need to be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.",Luke Muir; Weng M Ng; Helen M. E.

393,Multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics demonstrate very high potency against mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 100 million people globally, and continues to undergo genomic evolution. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies.

Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development start to lose potency against various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against such variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin(R) domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape.

Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that both multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics, ensovibep (MP0420) and MP0423, are highly potent against the new circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) and the most frequent emerging mutations in the spike protein. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multi-specific DARPin(R) antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin(R) molecules, suggests ensovibep and MP0423 as superior alternatives to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin(R) platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.",Sylvia Rothenberger; Marcel Walser; Francesca Malvezzi; Jennifer Mayor; Sarah Ryter; Hector Moreno; Nicole Liechti; Silvan Halg; Andreas Bosshart; Chloe Iss; Valerie Calabro; Andreas Cornelius; Tanja Hospodarsch; Alexandra Neculcea; Thamar Looser; Susanne Mangold; Christian Reichen; Filip Radom; Keith M.

394,A high-throughput radioactivity-based assay for screening SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex,"Frequent outbreaks of novel coronaviruses (CoVs), highlighted by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, necessitate the development of therapeutics that could be easily and effectively administered world-wide. The conserved mRNA-capping process enables CoVs to evade their host immune system and is a target for antiviral development. Nonstructural protein (nsp) 16 in complex with nsp10 catalyzes the final step of coronaviral mRNA-capping through its 2-O-methylation activity. Like other methyltransferases, SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex is druggable. However, the availability of an optimized assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) is an unmet need. Here, we report the development of a radioactivity-based assay for methyltransferase activity of nsp10-nsp16 complex in a 384-well format, and kinetic characterization, and optimization of the assay for HTS (Z'-factor: 0.83).

395,Characterization of the NiRAN domain from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase provides insights into a potential therapeutic target against SARS-CoV-2,"Apart from the canonical fingers, palm and thumb domains, the RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) from the viral order Nidovirales possess two additional domains. Of these, the function of the Nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyl transferase domain (NiRAN) remains unanswered. The elucidation of the 3D structure of RdRp from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), provided the first ever insights into the domain organisation and possible functional characteristics of the NiRAN domain. Using in silico tools, we predict that the NiRAN domain assumes a kinase or phosphotransferase like fold and binds nucleoside triphosphates at its proposed active site. Additionally, using molecular docking we have predicted the binding of three widely used kinase inhibitors and five well characterized anti-microbial compounds at the NiRAN domain active site along with their drug-likeliness as well as DFT properties. For the first time ever, using basic biochemical tools, this study shows the presence of a kinase like activity exhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Interestingly, the proposed kinase inhibitors and a few of the predicted nucleotidyl transferase inhibitors significantly inhibited the aforementioned enzymatic activity.

In this study, we selected the key mutations of SARS-CoV-2, including D614G and A222V of S protein and Q57H of ORF3a protein, to conduct molecular dynamics simulation and analysis on the structures of the mutant proteins. The results suggested that D614G improved the stability of S protein, while A222V enhanced the ability of protein to react with the outside environment. Q57H enhanced the structural flexibility of ORF3a protein. Our findings could complete the mechanistic link between genotype--phenotype--epidemiological characteristics in the study of SARS-CoV-2.

397,Variation in predicted COVID-19 risk among lemurs and lorises,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans leads to the disease COVID-19, has caused global disruption and more than 1.5 million fatalities since it first emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection rates are currently at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary viral target is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predicts that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results and finds additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and Endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their health should be a conservation priority.

398,Exaggerated cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 and its inhibition by dexamethasone,"An understanding of the pathological inflammatory mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is necessary in order to discover new molecular pharmacological targets for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. In this study, the effects of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Stimulation with spike glycoprotein S1 (100 ng/mL) resulted in significant elevation in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-8. However, pre-treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM) caused a significant reduction in the release of these cytokines. Further experiments revealed that S1 stimulation of PBMCs increased phosphorylation of NF-{kappa}B p65 and I{kappa}B, while increasing I{kappa}B degradation. DNA binding of NF-{kappa}B p65 was also significantly increased following stimulation with S1. Treatment of PBMCs with dexamethasone (100 nM) or BAY11 -7082 (1 M) resulted in inhibition of S1 -induced NF-{kappa}B activation. Activation of p38 MAPK by S1 was blocked in the presence of dexamethasone and SKF 86002. CRID3, but not dexamethasone pre-treatment produced significant inhibition of S1-induced activation of NLRP3/caspase-1. Further experiments revealed that S1-induced increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-8 was reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 and SKF 86002, while CRID3 pre-treatment resulted in the reduction of IL-1{beta} production. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulate PBMCs to release pro-inflammatory cytokines through mechanisms involving activation of NF-{kappa}B, p38 MAPK and NLRP3 inflammasome.

We aimed to investigate whether ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 deaths were similar in the more recent ""second wave"" of the epidemic. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used primary care and linked ONS mortality data within the OpenSAFELY platform. All adults in the database at 1st September 2020 and with at least 1 year of prior follow-up and a record of ethnicity were included. The outcome was COVID-19-related death (death with COVID-19 listed as a cause of death on the death certificate). Follow-up was to 9th November 2020. Hazard ratios for ethnicity were calculated using Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex, and then further adjusted for deprivation. 13,223,154 people were included. During the study period, people of South Asian ethnicity were at higher risk of death due to COVID-19 than white people after adjusting for age and sex (HR = 3.47, 95% CI 2.99-4.03); the association attenuated somewhat on further adjustment for index of multiple deprivation (HR = 2.86, 2.46-3.33, Table 2). In contrast with the first wave of the epidemic, we found little evidence of a raised risk in black or other ethnic groups compared to white (HR for black vs white = 1.28, 0.87-1.88 adjusted for age and sex; and 1.01, 0.69-1.49 further adjusted for deprivation). Our findings suggest that ethnic inequalities in the risk of dying COVID-19-related death have changed between the first and early second wave of the epidemic in England.

400,Knowledge and Awareness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Chinese dental students----a comparison study.,"BackgroudThis study aimed to measure the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Chinese dental students during the global outbreak recently.

MethodA descriptive cross-sectional study was performed among dental students and nonmedical college students in China. All the participants were required to anonymously answer a reliable online questionnaire, which covered 3 different fields of COVID-19. Average scores of dental students (D group), including junior (JD group) and senior dental students (SD group), and nonmedical college students (N group) were compared respectively. Chi-square test and independent sample T test were taken for statistical analysis with SPSS.12.

ResultsTotally 497 questionnaires were collected, including 224 from dental students and 273 from non-medical students. The overall average score was 57{+/-}19.2. The average scores of dental students were 64.5{+/-}18. The D group had significantly higher scores on the total score, section scores, and 20 questions respectively than with the N group. No significant differences were found on 5 questions. Compared with the N group, the SD group won on all three sections while JD group failed to win on the diagnose section.

ConclusionAlthough the dental student showed good awareness regarding the clinical aspects of COVID-19 than non-medical students, there are still some weakness in the part of treatment and prevention, which need to be strengthened for better prepare during work. Besides, the low accuracy rate of lower grade dental students is also worth noting.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429522,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429522,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False
401,'Phytopathological strolls' in the dual context of COVID-19 lockdown and IYPH2020: transforming constraints into an opportunity for public education about plant pathogens,"The experience presented here relates to 2020, a particularly timely year for plant disease-related communication ( International Year of Plant Health IYPH2020), but also a unique year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal was to illustrate the diversity and beauty of fungal plant pathogens through a naturalist approach that could be followed by any amateur. We achieved this end through  phytopathological strolls, in which we observed and determined the origin of symptoms on diseased plants found in our garden, in the local streets, in nearby open spaces, and sharing this matter with a broad public. The lockdown imposed in France created an additional motivation to take up the challenge, and to involve our children, even under strong constraints, such as movement restrictions. We observed and described fungal pathogens through hundreds of photographs, shared our findings with a large audience on Twitter, and received feedback. The material used was deliberately simple and transportable: a digital reflex camera, an old microscope, a mobile phone, some books and an Internet connexion. Between March 17 March and December 15, 2020 we found 148 plant pathogens, including 72 rusts, 22 powdery mildews and 22 septoria-like diseases. We discuss here the importance of promoting searches for plant pathogens, their description and conservation, through a combination of classical approaches and digital tools in tune with the times, such as Twitter, by treating pathogen identification like a detective game and, more surprisingly, by making use of the addictive nature of collection approaches, drawing a parallel with Pokemon Go.",Frédéric Suffert; Muriel Suffert,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429201,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429201,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,False

We have surveyed 740 researchers of which 66% experienced a decrease in productivity, 50% indicated increased workload, and 66% reported they have been feeling internal pressure to make progress. Those whose research required physical presence in a lab or the field experienced considerable disruption and productivity decrease. About 82% of this group will try to permanently reduce their work dependency on physical presence. Parents and those taking care of vulnerable dependents have been spending less time on research due to their role conflict. We further observed a gender gap in the overall disruption consequences; more female researchers have been experiencing a reduction in productivity and external pressure to make progress.

Global concerns have been raised for its potential to affect vaccine efficacy. Here, we evaluated the neutralization activities of two vaccines developed in China against 501Y.V2. One is licensed inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV and the other one is recombinant dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) vaccine ZF2001. Encouragingly, both vaccines largely preserved neutralizing titres, with slightly reduction, against 501Y.V2 authentic virus compare to their titres against both original SARS-CoV-2 and the currently circulating D614G virus.

404,Radius of Gyration as predictor of COVID-19 deaths trend with three-weeks offset,"Total and perimetral lockdowns were the strongest nonpharmaceutical interventions to fight against Covid-19, as well as the with the strongest socioeconomic collateral effects. Lacking a metric to predict the effect of lockdowns in the spreading of COVID-19, authorities and decision-makers opted for preventive measures that showed either too strong or not strong enough after a period of two to three weeks, once data about hospitalizations and deaths was available. We present here the radius of gyration as a candidate predictor of the trend in deaths by COVID-19 with an offset of three weeks. Indeed, the radius of gyration aggregates the most relevant microscopic aspects of human mobility into a macroscopic value, very sensitive to temporary trends and local effects, such as lockdowns and mobility restrictions. We use mobile phone data of more than 13 million users in Spain during a period of one year (from January 6th 2020 to January 10th 2021) to compute the users daily radius of gyration and compare the median value of the population with the evolution of COVID-19 deaths: we find that for all weeks where the radius of gyration is above a critical value (70% of its pre-pandemic score) the number of weekly deaths increases three weeks after. The reverse also stands: for all weeks where the radius of gyration is below the critical value, the number of weekly deaths decreased after three weeks. This observation leads to two conclusions: i) the radius of gyration can be used as a predictor of COVID-19-related deaths; and ii) partial mobility restrictions are as effective as a total lockdown as far the radius of gyration is below this critical value.

BackgroundAuthorities around the World have used lockdowns and partial mobility restrictions as major nonpharmaceutical interventions to control the expansion of COVID-19. While effective, the efficiency of these measures on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths is difficult to quantify, severely limiting the feedback that can be used to tune the intensity of these measures. In addition, collateral socioeconomic effects challenge the overall effectiveness of lockdowns in the long term, and the degree by which they are followed can be difficult to estimate. It is desirable to find both a metric to accurately monitor the mobility restrictions and a predictor of their effectiveness.

MethodsWe correlate the median of the daily radius of gyration of more than 13M users in Spain during all of 2020 with the evolution of COVID-19 deaths for the same period. Mobility data is obtained from mobile phone metadata from one of the major operators in the country.

ResultsThe radius of gyration is a predictor of the trend in the number of COVID-19 deaths with 3 weeks offset. When the radius is above/below a critical threshold (70% of the pre-pandemic score), the number of deaths increases/decreases three weeks later.

ConclusionsThe radius of gyration can be used to monitor in real time the effectiveness of the mobility restrictions. The existence of a critical threshold suggest that partial lockdowns can be as efficient as total lockdowns, while reducing their socioeconomic impact. The mechanism behind the critical value is still unknow, and more research is needed.",Alberto Hernando de Castro; David Mateo; Jordi Bayer; Ignacio Barrios,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250708,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250708,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True
405,COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and inequity in the United States: Results from a nationally representative survey,"BackgroundAt the time of this survey, September 1st, there were roughly 6 million COVID-19 cases and 176,771 deaths in the United States and no federally approved vaccine. The objective of this study was to explore the willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States and describe variability in this acceptability by key racial, ethnic and socio-demographic characteristics.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional digital survey that sampled participants from a nationally-representative panel maintained by a third party, Dynata. Dynata randomly sampled their database and emailed web-based surveys to United States residents ensuring the sample was matched to US Census estimates for age, race, gender, income, and Census region. Participants were asked how willing or unwilling they would be to: 1) receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it was made publicly available, and 2) receive the influenza vaccine for the upcoming influenza season. Participants could respond with extremely willing, willing, unwilling, or extremely unwilling. For those who reported being unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, reasons for this hesitancy were captured. All participants were asked about where they obtain vaccine-related information, and which sources they trust most. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association of all demographic characteristics with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

FindingsFrom September 1st to September 7, 2020, 1592 respondents completed the online survey. Overall, weighted analyses found that only 58.9% of the sample population were either willing or extremely willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it was made publicly available. In comparison, 67.7% of the respondents were willing or extremely willing to take the influenza vaccine. By gender, 66.1% of males and 51.5% of females were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Males were significantly more willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.98, 95% CI: 1.56, 2.53; p<0.001) than females. Blacks were the least willing racial/ethnic group (48.8%) Blacks, (aOR=0.59, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.80; p<0.001) were significantly less willing, than whites, to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. There were numerous reasons provided for being unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The most common reason was concern about the vaccines safety (36.9%), followed by concerns over its efficacy (19.1%).

InterpretationIn conclusion, we found that a substantial proportion (41%) of United States residents are unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as one is made publicly available. We found that vaccine acceptance differs by sub-populations. In addition to sub-group differences in willingness to receive the vaccine, respondents provided a variety of reasons for being unwilling to receive the vaccine, driven by various sources of vaccine information (and misinformation). This compounds the challenge of delivering a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine at a population level to achieve herd immunity. A multi-pronged and targeted communications and outreach effort is likely needed to achieve a high level of immunization coverage.",Dustin G Gibson; Smisha Agarwal; Ankita Meghani; Rupali Limaye; Alain Bernard Labrique,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250784,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250784,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True
406,Sustainable targeted interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic: A big data-driven modeling study in Hong Kong,"BackgroundThe nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for contact suppression have been widely used worldwide, which impose harmful burdens on the population and the local economy. The evaluation of alternative NPIs is needed to confront the pandemic with less disruption. By harnessing human mobility data, we develop an agent-based model that can evaluate the efficacies of NPIs with individualized mobility simulations. Based on the model, we propose the data-driven targeted interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong without city-wide NPIs.

MethodsWe develop a data-driven agent-based model for 7.55 million Hong Kong residents to evaluate the efficacies of various NPIs in the first 80 days of the initial outbreak. The entire territory of Hong Kong is split into 4,905 500mx500m grids. The model can simulate detailed agent interactions based on the demographics data, public facilities and functional buildings, transportation systems, and travel patterns. The general daily human mobility patterns are adopted from Googles Community Mobility Report. The scenario without any NPIs is set as the baseline. By simulating the epidemic progression and human movement at the individual level, we proposed model-driven targeted interventions, which focus on the surgical testing and quarantine of only a small portion of regions instead of enforcing NPIs in the whole city. The efficacious of common NPIs and the proposed targeted interventions are evaluated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

FindingsWithout NPIs, we estimate that there are 128,711 total infections (IQR 23,511-70,310) by the end of the 80-day simulation. The proposed targeted intervention averts 95.85% and 94.13% of baseline infections with only 100 (2.04%) and 50 (1.02%) grids being quarantined, respectively. Mild social distancing without testing results in 16,503 total cases (87.18% infections averted), rapid implementation of full lockdown and testing measures (such as the control measure in Mainland China) performs the best, with only 805 infections (99.37% infections averted). Testing-and-quarantining 10%, 20%, 50% of all symptomatic cases with 24-hour/48-hour avert 89.92%/ 87.78%, 95.47%/ 92.42%, and 97.93%/ 95.61% infections, respectively.

InterpretationBig data-driven mobility modeling can inform targeted interventions, which are able to effectively contain the COVID-19 outbreak with much lower disruption of the city.

408,COVID-19 risk perceptions of social interaction and essential activities and inequity in the United States: Results from a nationally representative survey,"IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related diagnoses, hospitalizations, and deaths have disproportionately affected disadvantaged communities across the United States. Few studies have sought to understand how risk perceptions related to social interaction and essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic vary by sociodemographic factors, information that could inform targeted interventions to reduce inequities in access to care and information.

MethodsWe conducted a nationally representative online survey of 1,592 adults in the United States to understand risk perceptions related to transmission of COVID-19 for various social and essential activities. We assessed relationships for each activity, after weighting to adjust for the survey design, using bivariate comparisons and multivariable logistic regression modeling, between responses of safe and unsafe, and participant characteristics, including age, gender, race, education, income, and political affiliation.

ResultsHalf of participants were younger than 45 years (n=844, 53.0%), female (n=800, 50.3%), and White/Caucasian (n=685, 43.0%), Black/African American (n=410, 25.8%), or Hispanic/Latino (n=382, 24.0%). Risk perceptions of unsafe for 13 activities ranged from 29.2% to 73.5%. Large gatherings, indoor dining, and visits with elderly relatives had the highest proportion of unsafe responses (>58%) while activities outdoor, visiting the doctor or dentist, and going to the grocery store had the lowest (<36%). Older respondents were more likely to view social gatherings and indoor activities as unsafe, yet more likely to view activities such as going to the grocery store, participating in outdoor activities, visiting elderly relatives, and visiting the doctor or emergency room as safe. Compared to White/Caucasian respondents, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino respondents were more likely to view activities such as dining and visiting friends outdoor as unsafe. Generally, men vs. women, Republicans vs. Democrats and independents, and individuals with higher vs. lower income were more likely to view activities as safe.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest the importance of sociodemographic differences in risk perception, health behaviors, and access to information and health care when implementing efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should address how evidence-based interventions can be tailored considering these differences with a goal of increased health equity in the pandemic response.",Daniel J Erchick; Alexander J Zapf; Prativa Baral; Jeffrey Edwards; Shruti H Mehta; Sunil S Solomon; Dustin G Gibson; Smisha Agarwal; Alain B Labrique,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250705,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250705,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True
409,"Successful reboot of high-performance sporting activities by Japanese national women's handball team in Tokyo, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic: An initiative by Japan Sports-Cyber Physical System (JS-CPS) of Sports Research Innovation Project (SRIP)","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted sporting activities across the world. However, practical training strategies for athletes to reduce the risk of infection during the pandemic has not been definitively studied.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this report was to provide an overview of our challenges encountered during the reboot of high-performance sporting activities of the Japanese national handball team during the 3rd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo, Japan.

MethodsTwenty-nine Japanese national womens handball players and 24 staff participated in the study. To initiate the reboot of their first training camp after COVID-19 stay-home social policy, we conducted: web-based health-monitoring, SARS-CoV-2 screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, real-time automated quantitative monitoring of social distancing on-court using video-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, physical intensity evaluation with wearable heart rate (HR) and acceleration sensors, and self-reported online questionnaire.

ResultsThe training camp was conducted successfully with no COVID-19 infections. The web-based health monitoring and the frequent PCR testing with short turnaround times contributed remarkably in early detection of athletes health problems and risk screening. During handball, the AI based on-court social-distancing monitoring revealed key time-dependent spatial metrics to define player-to-player proximity. This information facilitated positive team members on and off-game distancing behavior. Athletes regularly achieved around 80% of maximum HR during training, indicating anticipated improvements in achieving their physical intensities. Self-reported questionnaires related to the COVID management in the training camp revealed a sense of security among the athletes allowing them to focus singularly on their training.

ConclusionThe current challenge provided us considerable know-how to create and manage a safe environment for high-performing athletes in the COVID-19 pandemic via the Japan Sports-Cyber Physical System (JS-CPS) of SRIP (Japan Sports Agency, Tokyo, Japan). This report is envisioned to provide informed decisions to coaches, trainers, policymakers from the sports federations in creating targeted, infection-free, sporting and training environments.",Issei Ogasawara; Shigeto Hamaguchi; Ryosuke Hasegawa; Yukihiro Akeda; Naoki Ota; Gajanan S.

410,Who should be first in line for the COVID-19 vaccine? Surveys in 13 countries of the publics preferences for prioritisation,"How does the public want a COVID-19 vaccine to be allocated? We conducted a conjoint experiment asking 15,536 adults in 13 countries to evaluate 248,576 profiles of potential vaccine recipients that varied randomly on five attributes. Our sample includes diverse countries from all continents. The results suggest that in addition to giving priority to health workers and to those at high risk, the public favours giving priority to a broad range of key workers and to those on lower incomes. These preferences are similar across respondents of different education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across most surveyed countries. The public favoured COVID-19 vaccines being allocated solely via government programs, but were highly polarized in some developed countries on whether taking a vaccine should be mandatory. There is a consensus among the public on many aspects of COVID-19 vaccination which needs to be taken into account when developing and communicating roll-out strategies.",Raymond Duch; Laurence S J Roope; Mara Violato; Matias F Becerra; Thomas Robinson; Jean-Francois Bonnefon; Jorge Friedman; Peter Loewen; Pavan Mamidi; Alessia Melegaro; Mariana Blanco; Juan Vargas; Julia Seither; Paolo Candio; Ana G Cruz; Xinyang Hua; Adrian Barnett; Philip Clarke,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250866,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250866,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True
411,Genetic determination of regional connectivity in modelling the spread of COVID-19 outbreak for improved mitigation strategies,"Covid-19 has resulted in the death of more than 1,500,000 individuals. Due to the pandemics severity, thousands of genomes have been sequenced and publicly stored with extensive records, an unprecedented amount of data for an outbreak in a single year. Simultaneously, prediction models offered region-specific and often contradicting results, while states or countries implemented mitigation strategies with little information on success, precision, or agreement with neighboring regions. Even though viral transmissions have been already documented in a historical and geographical context, few studies aimed to model geographic and temporal flow from viral sequence information. Here, using a case study of 7 states, we model the flow of the Covid-19 outbreak with respect to phylogenetic information, viral migration, inter- and intra- regional connectivity, epidemiologic and demographic characteristics. By assessing regional connectivity from genomic variants, we can significantly improve predictions in modeling the viral spread and intensity.

Contrary to previous results, our study shows that the vast majority of the first outbreak can be traced to very few lineages, despite the existence of multiple worldwide transmissions. Moreover, our results show that while the distance from hotspots is initially important, connectivity becomes increasingly significant as the virus establishes itself. Similarly, isolated local strategies-such as relying on herd immunity-can negatively impact neighboring states. Our work suggests that we can achieve more efficient unified mitigation strategies with selective interventions.",Leonidas Salichos; Jonathan Warrell; Hannah Cevasco; Alvin Chung; Mark Gerstein,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250785,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250785,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,True

Our aim was to infer the levels of virus importation and to estimate the impact of public health measures related to travel restrictions to local transmission in Greece. Our phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses included 389 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected during the first 7 months of the pandemic in Greece and a random collection in 5 replicates of 3,000 sequences sampled globally, as well as the best hits to our dataset identified by BLAST. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of 70 genetically distinct viruses identified as independent introductions into Greece. The proportion of imported strains was 41%, 11.5%, and 8.8% during the three periods of sampling, namely, March (no travel restrictions), April to June (strict travel restrictions), and July to September (lifting of travel restrictions based on a thorough risk assessment), respectively.

Early in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Argentinean Biobank of Infectious Diseases (BBEI) initiated the COVID19 collection and started its characterization.

MethodsBlood samples from subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection either admitted to health institutions or outpatients, were enrolled. Highly exposed seronegative individuals, were also enrolled. Longitudinal samples were obtained in a subset of donors, including persons who donated plasma for therapeutic purposes (plasma donors). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG levels, IgG titers and IgG viral neutralization capacity were determined.

FindingsOut of 825 donors, 57.1% were females and median age was 41 years (IQR 32-53 years). Donors were segregated as acute or convalescent donors, and mild versus moderate/severe disease donors. Seventy-eight percent showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Specific IgM and IgG showed comparable positivity rates in acute donors. IgM detectability rate declined in convalescent donors while IgG detectability remained elevated in early (74,8%) and late (83%) convalescent donors. Among donors with follow-up samples, IgG levels seemed to decline more rapidly in plasma donors. IgG levels were higher with age, disease severity, number of symptoms, and was more durable in moderate/severe disease donors. Levels and titers of anti-spike/RBD IgG strongly correlated with neutralization activity against WT virus.

InterpretationThe BBEI-COVID19 collection served a dual role in this SARS-CoV-2 global crisis. First, it feed researchers and developers transferring samples and data to fuel research projects. Second, it generated highly needed local data to understand and frame the regional dynamics of the infection.

415,"Therapeutic antibodies, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike N-terminal domain, protect lethally infected K18-hACE2 mice","Since the onset of the current COVID-19 pandemic, high priority is given to the development of neutralizing antibodies, as a key approach for the design of therapeutic strategies to countermeasure and eradicate the disease. Previously, we reported the development of human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) exhibiting very high protective ability. These mAbs recognize epitopes on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is considered to represent the main rout of receptor engagement by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The recent emergence of viral variants emphasizes the notion that efficient antibody treatments need to rely on mAbs against several distinct key epitopes in order to circumvent the occurrence of therapy escape-mutants. Here we report the isolation and characterization of 12 neutralizing mAbs, identified by screening a phage-display library constructed from lymphatic cells collected from severe COVID-19 patients. The antibodies target three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2, one of them defining a major site of vulnerability of the virus. Extensive characterization of these mAbs suggests a neutralization mechanism which relies both on amino-acid and N-glycan recognition on the virus, and involvement of receptors other than the hACE2 on the target cell. Two of the selected mAbs, which demonstrated superior neutralization potency in vitro, were further evaluated in vivo, demonstrating their ability to fully protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice even when administered at low doses and late after infection. The study demonstrates the high potential of the mAbs for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underlines the possible role of the NTD in mediating infection of host cells via alternative cellular portals other than the canonical ACE2 receptor.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428995,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428995,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,False
416,Evolution of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Interplay Across 247 Vertebrates,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause the most serious pandemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which threatens human health and public safety. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as recognized receptor for its entry into host cell that contributes to the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to hosts. Using computational modeling approach, this study resolved the evolutionary pattern of bonding affinity of ACE2 in 247 jawed vertebrates to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. First, high-or-low binding affinity phenotype divergence of ACE2 to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has appeared in two ancient species of jawed vertebrates, Scyliorhinus torazame (low-affinity, Chondrichthyes) and Latimeria chalumnae (high-affinity, Coelacanthimorpha). Second, multiple independent affinity divergence events recur in fishes, amphibians-reptiles, birds, and mammals. Third, high affinity phenotypes go up in mammals, possibly implying the rapid expansion of mammals might accelerate the evolution of coronaviruses. Fourth, we found natural mutations at eight amino acid sites of ACE2 can determine most of phenotype divergences of bonding affinity in 247 vertebrates and resolved their related structural basis. Moreover, we also identified high-affinity or low-affinity-associated concomitant mutation group.The group linked to extremely high affinity may provide novel potentials for the development of human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) in treating patients with COVID-19 or for constructing genetically modified SARS-CoV-2 infection models promoting vaccines studies.

417,Computational insights into differential interaction of mamalian ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has spread globally. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the host cell receptor that binds to receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein and mediates cell entry. Because the ACE2 proteins are widely available in mammals, it is important to investigate the interactions between the RBD and the ACE2 of other mammals. Here we analyzed the sequences of ACE2 proteins from 16 mammals and predicted the structures of ACE2-RBD complexes. Analyses on sequence, structure, and dynamics synergistically provide valuable insights into the interactions between ACE2 and RBD. The comparison results suggest that the ACE2 of bovine, cat and panda form strong binding with RBD, while in the cases of rat, least horseshoe bat, horse, pig, mouse and civet, the ACE2 proteins interact weakly with RBD.",Cecylia Severin Lupala; Vikash Kumar; Xiao-dong Su; Haiguang Liu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429327,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429327,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,False
418,The basis of a more contagious 501Y.V1 variant of SARS-COV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a world-wide pandemic. A variant of SARS-COV-2 (20I/501Y.V1) recently discovered in the United Kingdom has a single mutation from N501 to Y501 within the receptor binding domain (Y501-RBD), of the Spike protein of the virus. This variant is much more contagious than the original version (N501-RBD). We found that this mutated version of RBD binds to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) a ~10 times more tightly than the native version (N501-RBD). Modeling analysis showed that the N501Y mutation would allow a potential aromatic ring-ring interaction and an additional hydrogen bond between the RBD and ACE2. However, sera from individuals immunized with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine still efficiently block the binding of Y501-RBD to ACE2 though with a slight compromised manner by comparison with their ability to inhibit binding to ACE2 of N501-RBD. This may raise the concern whether therapeutic anti-RBD antibodies used to treat COVID-19 patients are still efficacious. Nevertheless, a therapeutic antibody, Bamlanivimab, still binds to the Y501-RBD as efficiently as its binds to N501-RBD.",Gongyi Zhang; Haolin Liu; Qianqian Zhang; Pengcheng Wei; Zhongzhou Chen; Katja Aviszus; John Yang; Walter Downing; Shelley Peterson; Chengyu Jiang; Bo Liang; Lyndon Reynoso; Gregory Downey; Stephen Frankel; John Kapper; Philippa Marrack,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428884,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428884,2021-02-02,2021-02-02,,False
419,Emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19,"The complexities involved in modeling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 has been a major roadblock in achieving predictability in the spread and containment of the disease. In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model--the Blue Sky model--and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during a pandemic.",Ayan Paul; Jayanta Kumar Bhattacharjee; Aksay Pal; Sagar Chakraborty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250750,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250750,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
420,Discovery of re-purposed drugs that slow SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused the death of over 2 million people worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst effective vaccines have been developed and vaccination schedules are being rolled out, the identification of safe and inexpensive drugs to slow the replication of SARS-CoV-2 could help thousands of people worldwide whilst awaiting vaccination.

MethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 tagged with nano-luciferase (SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc) we screened a variety of cells under optimised cell culture conditions for their ability to be infected by, and support the replication of, SARS-CoV-2. Electron microscopy was used to demonstrate generation of infectious virus particles. We assessed a library of 1971 FDA-approved drugs for their ability to inhibit or enhance viral replication in Vero (simian kidney cells) but also in the human hepatocyte cell, HUH7. Initial hits were further tested to identify compounds that could suppress viral replication, post-viral infection. Dose response curves were obtained for a shortlist of 9 compounds of interest (COI).

FindingsOur SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc virus was as effective as wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in inducing CPE and replicating in Vero cells. Conventional electron microscopy showed the NLuc-tagged virus to be structurally indistinguishable from the wild-type virus, and both could be identified within the endosomal system of infected cells. SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc was used in experiments to robustly quantitate virus infection and replication. A wide variety of human cells including lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells were susceptible to infection but were not effective in supporting SARS-CoV-2-{Delta}Orf7a-NLuc replication. In contrast, human kidney epithelial cells and human hepatic cells were particularly susceptible and supported SARS-CoV-2-replication, which is in-line with reported proteinuria and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. Our screening of FDA approved compounds identified 35 COI that inhibited virus infection and replication in either Vero or human cell lines. Nine of these also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication when treatment commenced after virus infection. Therapeutics approved for treatment of cancer, malaria, hypertension and viral infection were identified with atovaquone, manidipine, vitamin D3 and ebastine being well tolerated with minimal side effects. Only two COI were consistently found to enhance SARS-CoV-2 replication, aliskiren and lithocholic acid.

InterpretationRe-purposing of safe, well-tolerated FDA-approved drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication is an attractive strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection prior to receiving an effective vaccine. The COI identified here hold potential to contain COVID-19 whilst wide-scale vaccination proceeds. The identification of FDA-approved drugs that enhance SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells suggests that entry routes into cells can be made more accessible to the virus by certain medications.

421,"Expression of human ACE2 N-terminal domain, part of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in fusion with maltose binding protein, E. coli ribonuclease I and human RNase A","The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome contains a positive-strand single-stranded RNA of ~30 kb. Human ACE2 protein is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus attachment and initiation of infection. We propose to use ribonucleases (RNases) as antiviral agents to destroy the viral genome in vitro. In the virions the RNA is protected by viral capsid proteins, membrane proteins and nucleocapsid proteins. To overcome this protection we set out to construct RNase fusion with human ACE2 receptor N-terminal domain (ACE2NTD). We constructed six proteins expressed in E. coli cells: 1) MBP-ACE2NTD, 2) ACE2NTD-GFP, 3) RNase I (6xHis), 4) RNase III (6xHis), 5) RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis), and 6) human RNase A-ACE2NTD150 (6xHis). We evaluated fusion expression in different E. coli strains, partially purified MBP-ACE2NTD protein from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysate, and refolded MBP-ACE2NTD protein from inclusion body. The engineered RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) and hRNase A-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusions are active in cleaving COVID-19 RNA in vitro. The recombinant RNase I (6xHis) and RNase III (6xHis) are active in cleaving RNA and dsRNA in test tube. This study provides a proof-of-concept for construction of fusion protein between human cell receptor and nuclease that may be used to degrade viral nucleic acids in our environment.

422,Mn2+ coordinates Cap-0-RNA to align substrates for efficient 2'-O-methyl transfer by SARS-CoV-2 nsp16,"Capping viral messenger RNAs is essential for efficient translation and prevents their detection by host innate immune responses. For SARS-CoV-2, RNA capping includes 2'-O-methylation of the first ribonucleotide by methyltransferase nsp16 in complex with activator nsp10. The reaction requires substrates, a short RNA and SAM, and is catalyzed by divalent cations, with preference for Mn2+. Crystal structures of nsp16-nsp10 with capped RNAs revealed a critical role of metal ions in stabilizing interactions between ribonucleotides and nsp16, resulting in precise alignment of the substrates for methyl transfer. An aspartate residue that is highly conserved among coronaviruses alters the backbone conformation of the capped RNA in the binding groove. This aspartate is absent in mammalian methyltransferases and is a promising site for designing coronavirus-specific inhibitors.",George Minasov; Monica Rosas-Lemus; Ludmilla Shuvalova; Nicole L.

423,Identification of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) oxysterol derivatives in vitro,"Development of effective antiviral drugs targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oxysterols, defined as oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, include endogenous (naturally occurring) cholesterol metabolites as well as semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives. We have previously studied the use of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives as drug candidates for inhibition of cancer, fibrosis, and bone regeneration. In this study, we have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay. We show that the natural oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells. Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy186 displayed antiviral activity comparable to natural oxysterols. In addition, related oxysterol analogues Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 M and 99% at 15 M, respectively. When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of Oxy210 fall into a therapeutically relevant range (19 M), based on the dose-dependent curve for antiviral activity in our cell culture infection assay. Mechanistic studies suggest that Oxy210 reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 with disrupting the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), intracellular membrane compartments associated with viral replication. Oxy210 also inhibited the replication of hepatitis C virus, another RNA virus whose replication is associated with DMVs, but not the replication of the DMV-independent hepatitis D virus. Our study warrants further evaluation of Oxy210 and Oxy232 as a safe and reliable oral medication, which could help protect vulnerable populations with increased risk developing COVID-19.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.429001,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.429001,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
424,Sequential delivery of LAIV and SARS-CoV-2 in the ferret model can reduce SARS-CoV-2 shedding and does not result in enhanced lung pathology.,"Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses could pose unpredictable risks to health systems globally, with recent studies suggesting more severe disease outcomes in co-infected patients. The lack of a readily available COVID-19 vaccine has reinforced the importance of influenza vaccine programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) is an important tool in protecting against influenza, particularly in children. However, it is unknown whether LAIV administration might influence the outcomes of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease. To investigate this, quadrivalent LAIV (QLAIV) was administered to ferrets 3 days pre- or post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. LAIV administration did not exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 disease course or lung pathology with either regimen. Additionally, LAIV administered prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract (URT). We conclude that LAIV administration in close proximity to SARS-CoV-2 infection does not exacerbate mild disease and can reduce SARS-CoV-2 shedding.",Kathryn A Ryan; Katarzyna E Schewe; Jonathan Crowe; Susan A Fotheringham; Yper Hall; Richard Humphreys; Anthony C Marriott; Jemma Paterson; Emma Rayner; Francisco J Salguero; Robert J Watson; Catherine J Whittaker; Miles W Carroll; Oliver Dibben,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429110,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429110,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False

The FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir is one of the drugs that has been reported to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV2 replication. We here report on the effect of Nelfinavir in the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Although treatment of infected hamsters with either 15 mg/kg BID or 50 mg/kg BID Nelfinavir [for four consecutive days, initiated on the day of infection] did not reduce viral RNA loads nor infectious virus titres in the lungs (as compared to the vehicle control at the end of treatment) the drug markedly improved virus-induced lung pathology at doses that were well tolerated. Yet, a massive interstitial infiltration of neutrophils was observed in the lungs of treated (infected and uninfected) animals.

426,Environmentally-induced mdig is a major contributor to the severity of COVID-19 through fostering expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor NRPs and glycan metabolism,"The novel {beta}-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 101 million people and resulted in 2.2 million death worldwide. Recent epidemiological studies suggested that some environmental factors, such as air pollution, might be the important contributors to the mortality of COVID-19. However, how environmental exposure enhances the severity of COVID-19 remains to be fully understood. In the present report, we provide evidence showing that mdig, a previously reported environmentally-induced oncogene that antagonizes repressive trimethylation of histone proteins, is a master regulator for SARS-CoV-2 receptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, cathepsins, glycan metabolism and inflammation, key determinants for viral infection and cytokine storm of the patients. Depletion of mdig in bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing resulted in a decreased expression of NRP1, NRP2, cathepsins, and genes involved in protein glycosylation and inflammation, largely due to a substantial enrichment of lysine 9 and/or lysine 27 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) on these genes as determined by ChIP-seq. These data, accordingly, suggest that mdig is a key mediator for the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure and targeting mdig may be one of the effective strategies in ameliorating the symptom and reducing the mortality of COVID-19.",Fei Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.429010,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.429010,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
427,Identification of a conserved neutralizing epitope present on spike proteins from highly pathogenic coronaviruses,"Three pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged, with SARS-CoV-2 causing a global pandemic. While therapeutic antibodies targeting the SARS-2 spike currently focus on the poorly conserved receptor-binding domain, targeting essential neutralizing epitopes on the more conserved S2 domain may provide broader protection. We report three antibodies, binding epitopes conserved on the pre-fusion MERS, SARS-1 and SARS-2 spike S2 domains. Antibody 3A3 binds a conformational epitope with ~2.5 nM affinity and neutralizes in in vitro SARS-2 cell fusion and pseudovirus assays. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry identified residues 980-1006 in the flexible hinge region at the S2 apex as the 3A3 epitope, consistent with binding to natural and engineered spike variants. This location at the spike trimer interface suggests 3A3 prevents the S2 conformational rearrangements required for virus-host cell fusion. This work defines a highly conserved vulnerable site on the SARS-2 S2 domain and may help guide the design of pan-protective spike immunogens.

428,Nanotraps for the containment and clearance of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through its viral spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cells. Here we show functionalized nanoparticles, termed ""Nanotraps"", completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 of host cells. The liposomal-based Nanotrap surfaces were functionalized with either recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and phagocytosis-specific phosphatidylserines. The Nanotraps effectively captured SARS-CoV-2 and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection to ACE2-expressing human cell lines and primary lung cells; the phosphatidylserine triggered subsequent phagocytosis of the virus-bound, biodegradable Nanotraps by macrophages, leading to the clearance of pseudotyped and authentic virus in vitro. Furthermore, the Nanotraps demonstrated excellent biosafety profile in vitro and in vivo.

Progress and PotentialTo address the global challenge of creating treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we devised a nanomedicine termed ""Nanotraps"" that can completely capture and eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Nanotraps integrate protein engineering, immunology, and nanotechnology and are effective, biocompatible, safe, stable, feasible for mass production. The Nanotraps have the potential to be formulated into a nasal spray or inhaler for easy administration and direct delivery to the respiratory system, or as an oral or ocular liquid, or subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection to target different sites of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, thus offering flexibility in administration and treatment. More broadly, the highly versatile Nanotrap platform could be further developed into new vaccines and therapeutics against a broad range of diseases in infection, autoimmunity and cancer, by incorporating with different small molecule drugs, RNA, DNA, peptides, recombinant proteins, and antibodies.",Min Chen; Jillian Rosenberg; Xiaolei Cai; Andy Chao Hsuan Lee; Jiuyun Shi; Mindy Nguyen; Thirushan Wignakumar; Vikranth Mirle; Arianna Joy Edobor; John Fung; Jessica Scott Donington; Kumaran Shanmugarajah; Eugene  B.

429,Enhanced immunogenicity of a synthetic DNA vaccine expressing consensus SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using needle-free immunization,"The ongoing global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for an urgent development of effective and safe prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 g of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 g or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of needle-free system could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.",Saswan S Alamri; Khalid A Alluhaybi; Rowa Y Alhabbab; Abdullah Algaissi; Sarah Almahboub; Mohamed A Alfaleh; Turki S Abujamel; Wesam Abdulaal; M-Zaki ElAssouli; Rahaf Alharbi; Mazen Hassanain; Anwar M Hashem,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429219,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429219,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
430,In vitro inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with 0.5% povidone iodine nasal spray (Nasodine) at clinically relevant concentrations and timeframes using tissue culture and PCR based assays,"BACKGROUNDThere has been considerable speculation regarding the potential of PVP-I nasal disinfection as an adjunct to other countermeasures during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Nasodine is a commercial formulation of 0.5% PVP-I that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy in human trials as a treatment for the common cold, including a Phase III trial (ANZCTR: ACTRN12619000764134). This study presents the first report of the in vitro efficacy of this formulation against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODSWe conducted in vitro experiments to determine if the PVP-I formulation inactivated SARS-CoV-2 using two independent assays and virus isolates, and incorporating both PCR-based detection and cell culture methods to assess residual virus after exposure to the formulation.

RESULTSBased on cell culture results, the PVP-I formulation was found to rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 isolates in vitro in short timeframes (15 seconds to 15 minutes) consistent with the minimum and maximum potential residence time in the nose. The Nasodine formula was found to be more effective than 0.5% PVP-I in saline. Importantly, it was found that the formulation inactivated culturable virus but had no effect on PCR-detectable viral RNA.

CONCLUSIONSThe PVP-I formulation eliminated the viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus with short exposure times consistent with nasal use. PCR alone may not be adequate for viral quantification in nasal PVP-I studies; future studies should incorporate cell culture to assess viral viability. Nasal disinfection with PVP-I may be a useful intervention for newly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients to reduce transmission risk and disease progression to the lower respiratory tract.",Simon P Tucker; Stephen Goodall; Peter Molloy; Justin Julander; Michelle Mendenhall; Peter Friedland,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.426979,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.426979,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,False
431,Host PDZ-containing proteins targeted by SARS-Cov-2,"Small linear motif targeting protein interacting domains called PDZ have been identified at the C-terminus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins E, 3a, and N. Using a high-throughput approach of affinity-profiling against the full human PDZome, we identified sixteen human PDZ binders of SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3A and N showing significant interactions with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 M to 82 M. Six of them (TJP1, PTPN13, HTRA1, PARD3, MLLT4, LNX2) are also recognized by SARS-CoV while three (NHERF1, MAST2, RADIL) are specific to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Most of these SARS-CoV-2 protein partners are involved in cellular junctions/polarity and could be also linked to evasion mechanisms of the immune responses during viral infection. Seven of the PDZ-containing proteins among binders of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3a or N affect significantly viral replication under knock-down gene expression in infected cells. This PDZ profiling identifying human proteins potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 can help to understand the multifactorial severity of COVID19 and to conceive effective anti-coronaviral agents for therapeutic purposes.",Celia Caillet-Saguy; Fabien Durbesson; Veronica V.

433,Prediction Models for Severe Manifestations and Mortality due to COVID-19: A Rapid Systematic Review,"BackgroundThroughout 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a threat to public health on national and global level. There has been an immediate need for research to understand the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that can help predict deterioration including mechanical ventilation, organ support, and death. Studies thus far have addressed the epidemiology of the disease, common presentations, and susceptibility to acquisition and transmission of the virus; however, an accurate prognostic model for severe manifestations of COVID-19 is still needed because of the limited healthcare resources available.

ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to evaluate published reports of prediction models for severe illnesses caused COVID-19.

MethodsSearches were developed by the primary author and a medical librarian using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating terms. Comprehensive strategies, including both index and keyword methods, were devised for PubMed and EMBASE. The data of confirmed COVID-19 patients from randomized control studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies published between January 2020 and July 2020 were retrieved. Studies were independently assessed for risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We collected study type, setting, sample size, type of validation, and outcome including intubation, ventilation, any other type of organ support, or death. The combination of the prediction model, scoring system, performance of predictive models, and geographic locations were summarized.

ResultsA primary review found 292 articles relevant based on title and abstract. After further review, 246 were excluded based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forty-six articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Inter observer agreement on inclusion was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.79 - 0.93). When the PROBAST tool was applied, 44 of the 46 articles were identified to have high or unclear risk of bias, or high or unclear concern for applicability. Two studied reported prediction models, 4C Mortality Score from hospital data and QCOVID from general public data from UK, and were rated as low risk of bias and low concerns for applicability.

ConclusionSeveral prognostic models are reported in the literature, but many of them had concerning risks of biases and applicability. For most of the studies, caution is needed before use, as many of them will require external validation before dissemination. However, two articles were found to have low risk of bias and low applicability can be useful tools.",Jamie Miller; Masafumi Tada; Michihiko Goto; Nicholas M Mohr; Sangil Lee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250718,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250718,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
434,The mobility gap: estimating mobility levels required to control Canada's winter COVID-19 surge,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions remain a primary means of suppressing COVID-19 until vaccination coverage is sufficient to achieve herd immunity. We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures in seven Canadian provinces to quantify the mobility level needed to suppress COVID-19 (mobility threshold), and the difference relative to current mobility levels (mobility gap).

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal study of weekly COVID-19 incidence from March 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021, among provinces with 20 COVID-19 cases in at least 10 weeks. The outcome was weekly growth rate defined as the ratio of current cases compared to the previous week. We examined the effects of average time spent outside the home (non-residential mobility) in the prior three weeks using a lognormal regression model accounting for province, season, and mean temperature. We calculated the COVID-19 mobility threshold and gap.

ResultsAcross the 44-week study period, a total of 704,294 persons were infected with COVID-19. Non-residential mobility dropped rapidly in the spring and reached a median of 36% (IQR: 31,40) in April 2020. After adjustment, each 5% increase in non-residential mobility was associated with a 9% increase in the COVID-19 weekly growth rate (ratio=1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12). The mobility gap increased through the fall months, which was associated with increasing case growth.

InterpretationMobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control COVID-19 through winter 2021. Mobility measures from anonymized smartphone data can be used to guide the provincial and regional implementation and loosening of physical distancing measures.",Kevin Antoine Brown; Jean-Paul R Soucy; Sarah A Buchan; Shelby L Sturrock; Isha Berry; Nathan M Stall; Peter Juni; Amir Ghasemi; Nicholas Gibb; Derek R MacFadden; Nick Daneman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250622,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250622,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
435,Uncovering Survivorship Bias in Longitudinal Mental Health Surveys,"Background Markedly elevated adverse mental health symptoms were widely observed early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Unlike the U.S., where cross-sectional data indicate anxiety and depression symptoms have remained elevated, such symptoms reportedly declined in the U.K., according to analysis of repeated measures from a largescale longitudinal study. However, nearly 40% of U.K. respondents (those who did not complete multiple follow-up surveys) were excluded from analysis, suggesting that survivorship bias might partially explain this discrepancy. Methods We therefore assessed survivorship bias among U.S. respondents invited to complete multiple mental health surveys during the pandemic. Survivorship bias was assessed for (1) demographic differences in follow-up survey participation, (2) differences in adjusted initial adverse mental health symptom prevalences, and (3) differences in follow-up survey participation based on mental health experiences. Results Adjusting for demographics, individuals who completed only one or two out of four surveys had higher prevalences of anxiety and depression symptoms in April 2020 (e.g., one-survey versus four-survey, anxiety symptoms, adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.55, P=0.0045; depression symptoms, aPR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-1.75, P=0.00052). Moreover, individuals who experienced incident anxiety or depression symptoms had higher odds of not completing follow-up surveys (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.22-2.31, P=0.0015, aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15-2.12, P=0.0046, respectively). Conclusions Survivorship bias among longitudinal mental health survey respondents may lead to overly optimistic interpretations of mental health trends. Cross-sectional surveys may therefore provide more accurate estimates of population-level adverse mental health symptom prevalences.",Mark É. Czeisler; Joshua F. Wiley; Charles A.

436,Hot days and Covid19 - unusual heat stress for nursing professions in Germany,"ObjectivesOur aim was to identify whether working during hot days alongside with Covid-19 related personal protective equipment causes heat stress for nursing professionals in Germany.

MethodsUsing an online survey, we assessed the impact of hot weather on nursing staff performing in personal protective equipment. A random selection of nursing staff from hospitals, nursing homes and outpatient care participated in the survey.

ResultsOut of 428 participants, 6.3% were between 16 and 25 years old, 22.8% between 26 and 35 years, 21.9% between 36 and 45 years, 30.5% between 45 and 55 years, 18.2% between 56 and 65 years, and 0.3% were older than 65 years. Out of all participants, 18.2% were male and 82.5% female. The results of the survey showed that 48.3% had more than 20 years of experience in nursing and 46.2% cardiac, pulmonary, or other pre-existing conditions. Work was found exhaustive while working in PPE by 96.5% of the participants, and 93% complained of worse breathing. We found out that 85.8% reported difficulties to focus. Many workplaces turned out to lack adequate heat protection, with distinct differences concerning the amount of prophylactic and heat mitigating measures across institutions.

ConclusionsOur results clearly show that employers must make more of an effort to provide adequate heat protection for their nursing staff. In order to secure the public health care, there is a need for action, especially in the case of previous conditions of caregivers.

What is already known about this subject?{blacktriangleright} Working in personal protective equipment is often needed during pandemics, to protect nurses, doctors and staff from an infection.
{blacktriangleright}However, the equipment can also hamper efficiency and productivity of healthcare workers and lead to personal discomfort, for example, during heat waves.


What are the new findings?{blacktriangleright} According to our study, nurses and nursing assistants in Germany are often older than 45 years and, in many cases, suffer from pre-existing conditions, which exacerbate the problems with personal protective equipment during periods of hot temperatures.
{blacktriangleright}Many healthcare institutions do not offer adequate ways to mitigate heat stress for their staff.

438,Socioeconomic Disparities and COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance: Experience from Israel,"COVID-19 vaccination acceptance has a key role in mitigating the pandemic. Concern has been raised that vaccination rates will be limited in demographically defined areas of lower income. Israels rapid vaccination campaign may allow to assess these assumptions in real-world and to devise tools for effectively focusing the vaccination efforts. We analyzed the correlation between COVID-19 vaccination rates, socioeconomic status (SES) and active COVID-19 disease burden. We carried out a nationwide study, based on data provided by Ministry of Health of COVID-19 vaccination rates in all municipalities in Israel up to January 12th, 2021. Municipal Vaccination rates of population older than 60 significantly correlated with the socioeconomic status (r=0.83, 95% confidence interval [0.79 to 0.87]). Finally, we established a novel metric for focusing the vaccination efforts based on % vaccinations and active disease burden. In Israel, a case-model country for COVD-19 vaccinations, vaccination rates were strongly correlated with SES.

439,Standardization of a flow cytometry SARS-CoV-2 serologic test,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causing agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. The development of the humoral response to the virus has been the subject of intensive research and development. A flow cytometry-based assay using native full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expressed in 293T cells was recently proposed as a complementary seropositivity determination assay.

The aim of our study was to further develop the flow cytometry assay for potential use as a confirmatory test and to standardize its parameters and results for reliable inter-laboratory use. We have optimized the protocol, established the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and tested reproducibility using pre-COVID plasma samples and convalescent, SARS-CoV-2 individual plasma samples.

The flow-based assay was simplified and standardized by cultivating the 293T cells in suspension and expressing results in Mean Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF) using an internal antibody positive control. The ROC curve was determined with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and the assay specificity and sensitivity were established at 100% and 97.7% respectively. Reproducibility was good as determined on multiple cytometers, on different days, and with data acquisition as far as 72h post-staining.

440,Vaccination strategies for minimizing loss of life in Covid-19 in a Europe lacking vaccines,"Aim and BackgroundWe aimed at identifying vaccination strategies that minimize loss of life in the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 mainly kills the elderly, but the pandemic is driven by social contacts that are more frequent in the young. Vaccines elicit stronger immune responses per dose in younger persons. As vaccine production is a bottleneck, many countries have adopted a strategy of first vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable, while postponing vaccination of the young.

MethodsBased on published age-stratified immunogenicity data of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, we compared the established ""one dose fits all"" approach with tailored strategies: The known differential immunogenicity of vaccine doses in different age groups is exploited to vaccinate the elderly at full dose, while the young receive a reduced dose, amplifying the number of individuals receiving the vaccine early. A modeling approach at European Union scale with population structure, Covid-19 case and death rates similar to Europe in late January 2021 is used.

ResultsWhen the elderly were vaccinated preferentially, the pandemic initially continued essentially unchecked, as it was dominantly driven by social contacts in other age groups. Tailored strategies, including regular dosing in the elderly but reduced dose vaccination in the young, multiplied early vaccination counts, and even with some loss in protection degree for the individual person, the protective effect towards stopping the pandemic and protecting lives was enhanced, even for the elderly. In the European Union, pandemic duration (threshold >100000 cases/day) was shortened from 53 to 18-24 days; cumulative death count over 100 days was reduced by >30000. Data suggest that the findings may be relevant to both, the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines.

ConclusionProtecting the vulnerable, minimizing overall deaths and stopping the pandemic is best achieved by an adaptive vaccination strategy using an age-tailored vaccine dose.",Patrick Hunziker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250747,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250747,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
441,Early Multidrug Outpatient Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19) and Reduced Mortality Among Nursing Home Residents,"The outbreak of COVID-19 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world with tremendous morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found multidrug regimens relying on the use of hydroxychloroquine as well as other agents including doxycycline were associated with a statistically significant and >60% reductions in mortality. Going forward, we theorize and based on the evidence, that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients) has a genuine probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus that will prevent the development and/or worsening of problems associated with COVID-19, most particularly isolation, hospitalization, and death. In fact, with the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of patients with acute COVID-19 is possibly the most rational and importantly feasible strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If the approach remains  wait-and-see and elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. We put forth the notion that the most important factor in this regard, is making available early therapeutic intervention as described here. These drugs include and under supervision by skilled doctors, combination/sequenced ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, bromhexine hydrochloride, and favipiravir (outside the US), along with inhaled steroids such as budesonide and oral steroids including dexamethasone and prednisone, and anti-thrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as heparin). As the clinical trials data on treatments for COVID-19 mature, this early treatment therapeutic option deserves serious, urgent, and sober consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers.",Paul E Alexander; Robin Armstrong; George Fareed; Kulvinder Gill; John Lotus; Ramin Oskoui; Chad Podromomos; Harvey Risch; Howard Tenenbaum; Craig M Wax; Peter A McCullough,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250706,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250706,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
442,Administration of tocilizumab to patients with high concentrations of IL-6 in the course of COVID-19 is associated with a better prognosis,"BackgroundDespite the direct viral activity, the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) includes an overproduction of cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Therefore tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors, became considered as a possible therapeutic option.

MethodsPatients were selected from the SARSTer national database, which included 2332 individuals with COVID-19 and the current study included 825 adult patients with moderate to severe course. The retrospective analysis was performed in 170 patients treated with TCZ and 655 without this medication or any other anti-cytokine therapy. The end-points of treatment effectiveness were a rate of death, need for mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement.

ResultsPatients treated with TCZ were balanced compared to non-TCZ regarding gender, age, BMI, and prevalence of coexisting conditions. The reduced death rate was demonstrated in patients treated with TCZ and baseline IL-6 >100 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.10-0.78), or those needing oxygen supplementations who worsened within 7 days of hospitalization (HR: 0.38, 95% CI:0.16-0.88).

443,Modeling the potential impact of indirect transmission on COVID-19 epidemic,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 through direct transmission (person-to-person) has been the focus of most studies on the dynamics of COVID-19. The efficacy of social distancing and mask usage at reducing the risk of direct transmission of COVID-19 has been studied by many researchers. Little or no attention is given to indirect transmission of the virus through shared items, commonly touch surfaces and door handles. The impact of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and in the environment, on the dynamics of COVID-19 remain largely unknown. Also, the current increase in the number of cases despite the strict non-pharmaceutical interventions suggests a need to study the indirect transmission of COVID-19 while incorporating testing of infected individuals as a preventive measure. Assessing the impact of indirect transmission of the virus may improve our understanding of the overall dynamics of COVID-19. We developed a novel deterministic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-virus-death compartmental model to study the impact of indirect transmission pathway on the spread of COVID-19, the sources of infection, and prevention/control. We fitted the model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases at episode date in Toronto, Canada using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization algorithm. We studied the effect of indirect transmission on the epidemic peak, peak time, epidemic final size and the effective reproduction number, based on different initial conditions and at different stages. Our findings revealed an increase in cases with indirect transmission. Our work highlights the importance of implementing additional preventive and control measures involving cleaning of surfaces, fumigation, and disinfection to lower the spread of COVID-19, especially in public areas like the grocery stores, malls and so on. We conclude that indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has a significant effect on the dynamics of COVID-19, and there is need to consider this transmission route for effective mitigation, prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.",Jummy Funke David; Sarafa Adewale Iyaniwura; Pei Yuan; Yi Tan; Jude Dzevela Kong; Huaiping Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.20181040,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.20181040,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
444,Viral sequencing reveals US healthcare personnel rarely become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through patient contact,"BackgroundHealthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2019 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used at this institution to protect HCP from healthcare-associated transmission.

MethodsIn this retrospective case series, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combined viral sequence data and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection.

FindingsWe investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible patient contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality standards and were used for downstream analysis. We found the majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We found a smaller percentage could be traced to a coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%).

InterpretationInfection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn 16 January 2021 we searched for ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""healthcare workers"" AND ""viral sequencing"" in Google Scholar. This search returned 57 results, and included a number of preprint articles. We found two studies that used viral sequencing to investigate healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Netherlands 1 and the United Kingdom 2. To our knowledge, no study has used viral sequencing to specifically investigate the source of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare workers in the United States. Although we and others have written about the potential utility of sequencing as an infection control asset 3-6, few have demonstrated the practical application of such efforts.

Added value of this studyOur study suggests infection control measures in place at the institution evaluated in this case series are largely protecting healthcare personnel (HCP) from healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections. Even so, the majority of healthcare-associated infections we did identify appeared to be linked to HCP-to-HCP spread so additional messaging and guidelines to reduce HCP-to-HCP spread in and out of the workplace may be warranted. In addition, we demonstrated how rapid viral sequencing can be combined with, even limited, epidemiological information to reconstruct healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Implications of all the available evidenceHealthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections negatively affect HCP, patients, and communities. Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients and other HCP at risk. We found the majority of HCP infections appeared to be acquired through community exposure so measures to reduce community spread are critical. This further emphasizes the importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing programs, and the rapid distribution of vaccines.",Katarina M Braun; Gage Kahl Moreno; Ashley Buys; Max Bobholz; Molly A Accola; Laura Anderson; William M Rehrauer; David A Baker; Nasia Safdar; Alexander J Lepak; David O'Connor; Thomas Friedrich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250421,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250421,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
445,Comparative performance of multiplex salivary and commercially available serologic assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralization titers,"Oral fluid (hereafter saliva) offers a non-invasive sampling method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, data comparing performance of salivary tests against commercially-available serologic and neutralizing antibody (nAb) assays are lacking. This study compared the performance of a multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay targeting antibodies to nucleocapsid (N), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) antigens to three commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 serology enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, and BioRad) and nAb. Paired saliva and plasma samples were collected from 101 eligible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors >14 days since PCR+ confirmed diagnosis. Concordance was evaluated using positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement, overall percent agreement (PA), and Cohens kappa coefficient. The range between salivary and plasma EIAs for SARS-CoV-2-specific N was PPA: 54.4-92.1% and NPA: 69.2-91.7%, for RBD was PPA: 89.9-100% and NPA: 50.0-84.6%, and for S was PPA: 50.6-96.6% and NPA: 50.0-100%. Compared to a plasma nAb assay, the multiplex salivary assay PPA ranged from 62.3% (N) and 98.6% (RBD) and NPA ranged from 18.8% (RBD) to 96.9% (S). Combinations of N, RBD, and S and a summary algorithmic index of all three (N/RBD/S) in saliva produced ranges of PPA: 87.6-98.9% and NPA: 50-91.7% with the three EIAs and ranges of PPA: 88.4-98.6% and NPA: 21.9-34.4% with the nAb assay. A multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay demonstrated comparable performance to three commercially-available plasma EIAs and a nAb assay, and may be a viable alternative to assist in screening CCP donors and monitoring population-based seroprevalence and vaccine antibody response.",Christopher D Heaney; Nora Pisanic; Pranay R Randad; Kate Kruczynski; Tyrone Howard; Xianming Zhu; Kirsten Littlefield; Eshan Patel; Ruchee Shrestha; Oliver Laeyendecker; Shmuel Shoham; David J Sullivan; Kelly Gebo; Daniel Hanley; Andrew Redd; Thomas Quinn; Arturo Casadevall; Jonathan M Zenilman; Andrew Pekosz; Evan M Bloch; Aaron AR Tobian,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250717,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250717,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
446,Significance of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibody Testing during COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation,"ObjectiveTo assess the value of using SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody testing to prioritize the vaccination of susceptible individuals as part of a COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan when vaccine supply is limited.

MethodsA compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths.

ResultsThe use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed and moves closer to the peak day.

ConclusionsAntibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available.",Akane B Fujimoto; Inci Yildirim; Pinar Keskinocak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250721,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250721,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
447,Targeting TGF-b pathway with COVID-19 Drug Candidate ARTIVeda/PulmoHeal Accelerates Recovery from Mild-Moderate COVID-19,"Our COVID-19 drug candidate ARTIVeda/PulmoHeal is a novel gelatin capsule formulation of the Artemisia extract Ayurveda for oral delivery of TGF-{beta} targeting anti-malaria phytomedicine Artemisinin with documented anti-inflammatory and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here we report the safety and efficacy of ARTIVeda in adult COVID-19 patients with symptomatic mild-moderate COVID-19, who were treated in a randomized, open-label Phase IV study in Bangalore, Karnataka, India (Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/09/028044). ARTIVeda showed a very favorable safety profile, and the only ARTIVeda-related adverse events were transient mild rash and mild hypertension. Notably, ARTIVeda, when added to the SOC, accelerated the recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. While all patients were symptomatic at baseline (WHO score = 2-4), 31 of 39 (79.5%) of patients treated with ARTIVeda plus SOC became asymptomatic (WHO score = 1) by the end of the 5-day therapy, including 10 of 10 patients with severe dry cough 7 of 7 patients with severe fever. By comparison, 12 of 21 control patients (57.1%) treated with SOC alone became asymptomatic on day 5 (P=0.028, Fishers exact test). This clinical benefit was particularly evident when the treatment outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (WHO score = 4) treated with SOC alone versus SOC plus ARTIVeda were compared. The median time to becoming asymptomatic was only 5 days for the SOC plus ARTIVeda group (N=18) but 14 days for the SOC alone group (N=10) (P=0.004, Log-rank test). These data provide clinical proof of concept that targeting the TGF-{beta} pathway with ARTIVeda may contribute to a faster recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 when administered early in the course of their disease.",Vuong Trieu; Saran Saund; Prashant Rahate; Viljay Barge; Sunil Nalk; Hitesh Windlass; Fatih Uckun,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250418,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250418,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
448,Age significantly influences the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody assays,"BACKGROUNDPoint of care serological assays are a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnostics but do have limitations. This study evaluated the sensitivity of five rapid antibody assays and explored factors influencing their sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies.

METHODSFinger-prick blood samples from 102 participants, within two to six weeks of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, were tested for IgG and IgM on five rapid serological assays. The assay sensitivities were compared, and patient factors evaluated in order to investigate potential associations with assay sensitivity.

RESULTSSensitivity ranged from 36% to 69% for IgG and 13% to 67% for IgM. Age was the only factor significantly influencing the likelihood of a detectable IgG or IgM response. Individuals aged 40 years and older had an increased likelihood of a detectable IgG or IgM antibody response by rapid antibody assay.

450,Resource Allocation for Different Types of Vaccines against COVID-19: Tradeoffs and Synergies between Efficacy and Reach,"ObjectiveDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple vaccine candidates were developed in record time. The primary decision for a vaccine-ordering decision-maker then becomes how to allocate limited resources between different types of vaccines. One may expect that available resources should be favored towards a vaccine with high efficacy if it can be distributed as widely as any other vaccine. However, if a high efficacy vaccine consumes more resources than a vaccine with lower efficacy due to distributional challenges, the decision is no longer trivial as a widespread vaccination is necessary to reach herd immunity.

MethodsWe adapt a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIR-D) model with vaccination and simulate the level of infection attack rate (IAR) under different resource consumption ratios between two vaccine types with different resource allocation decisions.

ResultsWe find that when there are limited resources, allocating resources entirely to a vaccine with high efficacy that becomes available earlier than a vaccine with lower efficacy that becomes available later does not always lead to a lower IAR, particularly if the former can immunize less than a range of 5.9% to 6.4% of the population (with the selected study parameters) before the latter becomes available. Sensitivity analyses show that this result stays robust under different efficacy levels for the higher efficacy vaccine.

ConclusionsOur results show that the reach of a vaccine to be distributed widely under limited resources is a key factor to achieve low IAR levels, even though the vaccine may be of higher efficacy and may become available earlier than others. Manufacturing a novel vaccine lacking a fully developed suitable infrastructure for its effective distribution and storage may impact the potential benefits of the immunization program. Understanding the tradeoffs between efficacy and reach is critical for resource allocation decisions between different vaccine types to maximize the improvement in health outcomes.",Daniel Kim; Pelin Pekgun; Inci Yildirim; Pinar Keskinocak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250713,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250713,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
451,PCR assay to enhance global surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may increase transmissibility and/or cause escape from immune responses1-3, there is an urgent need for the targeted surveillance of circulating lineages. It was found that the B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1) variant first detected in the UK4,5 could be serendipitously detected by the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses, spike {Delta}69-70, would cause a ""spike gene target failure"" (SGTF) result. However, a SGTF result is not definitive for B.1.1.7, and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern that lack spike {Delta}69-70, such as B.1.351 (also 501Y.V2) detected in South Africa6 and P.1 (also 501Y.V3) recently detected in Brazil7. We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a {Delta}3675-3677) in all three variants, which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Using ORF1a {Delta}3675-3677 as the primary target and spike {Delta}69-70 to differentiate, we designed and validated an open source PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern8. Our assay can be rapidly deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence spread of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.",Chantal BF Vogels; Mallery Breban; Tara Alpert; Mary E Petrone; Anne E Watkins; Emma Hodcroft; Christopher E Mason; Gaurav Khullar; Joel T Dudley; Matthew J Mackay; Jianhui Wang; Chen Liu; Pei Hui; Steven Murphy; Caleb Neal; Eva Laszlo; Marie L Landry; Anthony Muyombwe; Randy Downing; Jafar Razeq; Richard A Neher; Joseph R Fauver; Nathan D Grubaugh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250486,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250486,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
452,Differences in detected viral loads guide use of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detection assays towards symptomatic college students and children.,"Limitations in timely testing for SARS-CoV-2 drive the need for new approaches in suspected COVID-19 disease. We queried whether viral load (VL) in the upper airways at presentation could improve the management and diagnosis of patients. This study was conducted in a 9 hospital system in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania between March 1-August 31 2020. Viral load was determined by PCR assays for patients presenting to the Emergency Departments (ED), community pediatrics practices and college health service. We found that for the ED patients, VL did not vary substantially between those admitted and not. VL was relatively equivalent across ages, except for the under 25 age groups that tended to present with higher loads. To determine if rapid antigen testing (RAT) could aid diagnosis in certain populations, we compared BD Veritor and Quidel Sofia to SOC PCR-based tests. The antigen assay provided a disease-detection sensitivity of >90% in a selection of 32 positive students and was modeled to have an 80% sensitivity in all positive students. In the outpatient pediatric population, the antigen assay detected 70% of PCR-positives. Extrapolating these findings to viral loads in older hospitalized patients, a minority would be detected by RAT (40%). Higher loads did correlate with death, though the prognostic value was marginal (ROC AUC of only 0.66). VL did not distinguish between those needing mechanical ventilation and routine inpatients. We conclude that VL in upper airways, while not prognostic for disease management, may aid in selecting proper testing methodologies for certain patient populations.",Juan Luis Gomez Marti; Jamie Gribschaw; Melissa McCullough; Abbie Mallon; Jamie Acero; Amy Kinzler; Jamie Godesky; Kelly Heidenreich; Jennifer Iagnemma; Marian Vanek; A William Pasculle; Tung Phan; Alejandro Hoberman; John V Williams; Stephanie Mitchell; Alan Wells,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250365,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250365,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

454,Application of a 27-protein candidate cardiovascular surrogate endpoint to track risk ascendancy and resolution in COVID-19.,"BackgroundThere is an urgent need for tools allowing the early prognosis and subsequent monitoring of individuals with heterogeneous COVID-19 disease trajectories. Pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease is a leading risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor outcomes, and cardiac involvement is prevalent in COVID-19 patients both during the acute phase as well as in convalescence. The utility of traditional CV risk biomarkers in mild COVID-19 disease or across disease course is poorly understood. We sought to determine if a previously validated 27-protein predictor of CV outcomes served a purpose in COVID-19.

MethodsThe 27-protein test of residual CV (RCV) risk was applied without modification to n=860 plasma samples from hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at disease presentation from three independent cohorts to predict COVID-19 severity and mortality. The same test was applied to an additional n=991 longitudinal samples to assess sensitivity to change in CV risk throughout the course of infection into convalescence.

ResultsIn each independent cohort, RCV predictions were significantly related to maximal subsequent COVID-19 severity and to mortality. At the baseline blood draw, the mean protein-predicted likelihood of an event in subjects who died during the study period ranged from 88-99% while it ranged from 8-36% in subjects who were not admitted to hospital. Additionally, the test outperformed existing risk predictors based on commonly used laboratory chemistry values or presence of comorbidities. Application of the RCV test to sequential samples showed dramatic increases in risk during the first few days of infection followed by risk reduction in the survivors; a period of catastrophically high cardiovascular risk (above 50%) typically lasted 8-12 days and had not resolved to normal levels in most people within that timescale.

ConclusionsThe finding that a 27-protein candidate CV surrogate endpoint developed in multi-morbid patients prior to the pandemic is both prognostic and acutely sensitive to the adverse effects of COVID-19 suggests that this disease activates the same biologic risk-related mechanisms. The test may be useful for monitoring recovery and drug response.",Clare Paterson; Yolanda Hagar; Michael A Hinterberg; Alexander W Charney; Diane M Del Valle; Michael R Filbin; Sacha Gnjatic; Jason D Goldman; Nir Hacohen; James R Heath; Rainer Hillenbrand; Lori L Jennings; Seunghee Kim-Schulze; Andrew T Magis; Miriam Merad; Konstantinos Mouskas; Nicole W Simons; Stephen A Williams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250129,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250129,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
455,High variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households and implications for control,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a high risk of transmission in close-contact indoor settings, which may include households. Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy.

MethodsWe compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior PCR test reporting from members of more than 9000 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population.

ResultsWe estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.38% (95% CI 0.30% - 0.48%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 35% (26% - 47%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 15% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.40 (0.32 - 0.51) to avoid continued growth of the Utah epidemic.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals.

We describe the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical phenotype of seropositive children admitted to a tertiary childrens hospital in South India.

MethodsTo determine the seropositivity and describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst hospitalised children, we performed a prospective clinical data collection and blood sampling of children admitted to Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, India over 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In seropositive children, we compared antibody titres between children with and without PIMS-TS.

ResultsOf 463 children, 91 (19.6%) were seropositive. The median (range) age of seropositive children was 5 years (1 month - 17 years). Clinical presentation was consistent with Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) in 48% (44/91) of seropositive children. The median (range) antibody titre was 54.8 (11.1-170.9) AU/ml among all seropositive children. The median antibody titre among the children with PIMS-TS (60.3 AU/mL) was significantly (p=0.01) higher when compared to the children without PIM-TS (54.8 AU/mL).

ConclusionWe describe the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 amongst hospitalised children in a LMIC tertiary childrens hospital. Almost half of the seropositive children had PIMS-TS. Antibody levels may be helpful in the diagnosis and disease stratification of PIMS-TS.

Lay summaryChildren usually present with minimal or no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) has emerged as a distinctive paediatric illness related to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 is being used increasingly as a diagnostic test for PIMS-TS. However, data on the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children is sparse. We therefore, attempted to identify the seropositivity and describe the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst infants and children getting hospitalised in a childrens hospital in south India. Nearly one-fifth of the hospitalised children tested serology positive over 4 months. Antibody levels in children with PIMS-TS were significantly higher in comparison to the other two groups (acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and children without PIMS-TS). Results from our study suggest that all children are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection though they may present with mild illness or no symptoms. We also observed that antibody testing may have a possible role in diagnosis of PIMS-TS.",Aishwarya Venkataraman; Balasubramanian S; Sulochana Putilibai; Lakshan Raj S; Sumanth Amperayani; Senthilnathan S; Anand Manoharan; Arokia Sophi; Amutha R; Kalaimaran Sadasivam; Anu Goenka; Ramanan A V,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250660,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250660,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
457,Increasing but inadequate intention to receive Covid-19 vaccination over the first 50 days of impact of the more infectious variant and roll-out of vaccination in UK: indicators for public health messaging,"ObjectivesTo inform critical public health messaging by determining how changes in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, attitudes to the priorities for administration, the emergence of new variants and availability of vaccines may affect the trajectory and achievement of herd immunity.

Methods>9,000 respondents in an ongoing cross-sectional participatory longitudinal epidemiology study (LoC-19, n=18,581) completed a questionnaire within their personal electronic health record in the week reporting first effective Covid-19 vaccines, and then again after widespread publicity of the increased transmissibility of a new variant (November 13th and December 31st 2020 respectively). Questions covered willingness to receive Covid-19 vaccination and attitudes to prioritisation. Descriptive statistics, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and natural language processing of free-text responses are reported, and how changes over the first 50 days of both vaccination roll-out and new-variant impact modelling of anticipated transmission rates and the likelihood and time to herd immunity.

FindingsCompared with the week reporting the first efficacious vaccine there was a 15% increase in acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination, attributable in one third to the impact of the new variant, with 75% of respondents ""shielding"" - staying at home and not leaving unless essential - regardless of health status or tier rules. 12.5% of respondents plan to change their behaviour two weeks after completing vaccination compared with 45% intending to do so only when cases have reduced to a low level. Despite the increase from 71% to 86% over this critical 50-day period, modelling of planned uptake of vaccination remains below that required for rapid effective herd immunity - now estimated to be 90 percent in the presence of a new variant escalating R0 to levels requiring further lockdowns. To inform the public messaging essential therefore to improve uptake, age and female gender were, respectively, strongly positively and negatively associated with wanting a vaccine. 22.7% disagreed with the prioritisation list, though 70.3% were against being able to expedite vaccination through payment. Teachers (988, 12.6%) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) (837, 10.7%) groups were most cited by respondents for prioritisation.

InterpretationIn this sample, the growing impact of personal choice among the increasingly informed public highlights a decrease in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy over time, with news of a new variant motivating increased willingness for vaccination but at levels below what may be required for effective herd immunity. We identify public preferences for next-in-line priorities, headed by teachers and BAME groups, consideration of which will help build trust and community engagement critical for maximising compliance with not only the vaccination programme but also all other public health measures.",Patrik Bachtiger; Alexander Adamson; William A Maclean; Jennifer K Quint; Nicholas S Peters,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250083,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250083,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
458,Relative humidity predicts day-to-day variations in COVID-19 cases in the city of Buenos Aires,"Possible links between the transmission of COVID-19 and meteorology have been investigated by comparing positive cases across geographical regions. Little is known, however, about the degree to which meteorological conditions drive the daily dynamics of COVID-19 spread at a given location. The main limitation is that individual waves of the disease are typically abrupt and eventful, making correlations somewhat anecdotal. In contrast, we here present a long-term case study for the city of Buenos Aires, which has suffered a single prolonged wave of spread during 2020, with most significant changes in policy and population behavior taking place before the main local outbreak. We found that humidity plays a prominent role in modulating the variation of COVID-19 positive cases through a negative-slope linear relationship, with an optimal lag of 9 days between the meteorological observation and the positive case report. This relationship is specific to winter months, when relative humidity predicts up to half of the variance in positive cases. Our results provide a tool to anticipate local surges in COVID-19 cases after events of low humidity. More generally, they add to accumulating evidence pointing to dry air as an important driver of global COVID-19 transmission.",Andrea L Pineda Rojas; Sandra M Cordo; Ramiro I Saurral; Jose L Jimenez; Linsey C Marr; Emilio Kropff,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250789,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250789,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
459,COVID-19 vaccine uptake among healthcare workers in the fourth country to authorize BNT162b2 during the first month of rollout,"BackgroundThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the fourth country in the world to authorize the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, which it rolled out on December 17, 2020 and first targeted at healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assesses vaccine uptake among this group during the first month of its availability.

MethodsA national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19 vaccine, sources of HCWs information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern, and anxiety level using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake.

ResultsOf the 1,058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%) were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not registered. In a bivariate analysis, not enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those > 40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005), Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, independent factors for not enrolling to receive the vaccine included being female (aOR = 0.287, 95%CI = 0.206-0.401, P < 0.001), being less than 40 years of age (aOR = 1.021, 95%CI = 1.002-1.040, P = 0.032), and using social media as a source of information (aOR = 0.207, 95%CI = 0.132-1.354, P = 0.001). Factors associated with uptake were being a Saudi national (aOR = 1.918, 95%CI = 1.363-2.698, P < 0.001), working in an intensive care unit (aOR = 1.495, 95%CI = 1.083-2.063, P = 0.014), and working at a university hospital (aOR = 1.867, 95%CI = 1.380-2.525, P < 0.001).

ConclusionsA low level of vaccine uptake was observed especially in female HCWs, those younger than 40 years old, and those who used social media as their source of vaccine information. This survey provides important information for public health authorities in order to scale up vaccination campaigns targeting these HCWs to increase vaccine enrollment and uptake.",Mazin Barry; Mohamad-Hani Temsah; Fadi Aljamaan; Basema Saddik; Ayman Al-Eyadhy; Shelaweeh Alanazi; Nurah Alamro; Abdullah Alhuzaimi; Ali Alhaboob; Fahad Alsohime; Ali Alaraj; Rabih Halwani; Amr Jamal; Omar Temsah; Fahad Alzamil; Ali Alsomialy; Jaffar Al-Tawfiq,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250749,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250749,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
460,COVID-19 Prevention Beliefs and Practices in College Students,"BackgroundAs college students in the United States return to university campuses, it is important to understand their beliefs and practices on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention.

PurposeTo assess beliefs and practices regarding COVID-19 prevention among college students in the United States

MethodsAn online, self-administered survey was developed that collected information on COVID-19 preventative practice and beliefs. Survey responses were collected between July 13, 2020 and July 31, 2020.

ResultsA total of 4,834 college students participated in the survey with a response rate of 22.9%. Compared to males, more female college students practiced COVID-19 preventative measures, including always wearing masks or face coverings in public (52% vs. 44%, p<0.001) and always or often observing social distancing (70% vs. 63%, p<0.001). In contrast to students from larger population areas, fewer college students from rural areas reported practicing prevention measures, such as always wearing a mask (24% rural v. 45% towns vs. 55% cities, p<0.001) and always social distancing (20% rural vs. 21% towns vs. 29% cities, p<0.001). Additionally, more students from rural areas have become much less worried about personally contracting COVID-19 over the last 3 months when compared to students from towns and cities (21% vs. 16% vs. 11%, p<0.001). Fewer white college students compared to other racial groups thought it was very important to wear masks (55% white vs. 76% Black vs. 82% Asian vs. 63% American Indian or Alaskan native (AIAN) & Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), p<0.001) and very important to practice social distancing (29% white vs. 50% Black vs. 53% Asian vs. 36% AIAN/NHOPI, p <0.001). Compared to Non-Hispanic students, more Hispanic students thought it was very important to practice preventative measures, including wearing a mask (71% vs. 58%, p<0.001), social distancing (37% vs. 32%, p=0.017), and good hand hygiene (77% vs. 67%, p=0.013).

ConclusionCOVID-19 prevention beliefs and practices differ between sexes, the size of town one lives, race, and ethnicity. In general, female students followed Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 prevention guidelines more closely than male students. Students who reside in areas of larger populations have more strict COVID-19 prevention beliefs and practices than students from areas with smaller populations. Asian and Black/African American students adhered closer to CDC COVID-19 prevention guidelines and had stronger beliefs for infection prevention measures than white or AIAN/NHOPI students. Hispanic/Latino students were more stringent in COVID-19 prevention beliefs and practices than non-Hispanic/Latino students.",Caitlyn Cassimatis; Liga Kreitner; Abdoulie Njai; Emily Leary; Aaron D Gray,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250794,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250794,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
461,How best do we engage the general population in testing for COVID-19?,"The UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) emphasises the need for high levels of engagement with communities and individuals to ensure the effectiveness of any COVID-19 testing programme. A novel pilot health surveillance programme to assess the feasibility of weekly mass RT-LAMP testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva samples collected at home was developed and piloted by the University of Southampton and Southampton City Council. Rapid qualitative evaluation was conducted to explore experiences of those who took part in the programme, of those who declined and of those in the educational and healthcare organisations involved in the pilot testing who were responsible for roll-out. This included 77 interviews and 20 focus groups with 223 staff, students, pupils and household members from four schools, one university, and one community healthcare NHS trust. Conversations revealed that high levels of communication, trust and convenience were necessary to ensure peoples engagement with the programme. This suggests community leaders and stakeholder organisations should be involved throughout programme development and implementation to optimise these features of the testing. Participants and stakeholders motivations, challenges and concerns need to be understood and these insights used to modify the programme in a continuous, real-time process to ensure and sustain engagement with testing over the extended period necessary.",Daniella Watson; Natalia Laverty Baralle; Jawahr Alagil; Krithika Anil; Sandy Ciccognani; Rachel Dewar-Haggart; Sarah Fearn; Julia Groot; Kathryn Knowles; Claire Meagher; Carmel McGrath; Sarah Muir; Jo Musgrove; Kate Glyn-Owen; Kath Woods-Townsend; Andrew Mortimore; Paul Roderick; Janis Baird; Hazel Inskip; Keith Godfrey; Mary Barker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250730,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250730,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
462,Ultra-short-wave diathermy shortens the course of moderate and severe COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundCOVID-19 patients have severe lung injury. The USWD could play a supportive role in relieving lung injury and enhance clinical recovery.

Methods and findingsThe design was a single-center, evaluator blinded; 2-arm parallel design superiority randomized controlled clinical trial. Moderate and severe coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients with acute respiratory syndrome, Fifty patients were randomized (USWD, 25; control, 25) between February 18/2020 and April 20/2020. There were male 22 (44.0%) and female 28 (56.0%) with mean (SD) age 53(10.69). Time to clinical recovery (USWD 36.84 vs control 43.56, P = 0.03) was significantly shortened with a between-group difference of 6.72 days. The median SIRS score at day 28 was 0 (0-1) in the USWD group, while 0 (0-2) in the control group (P = 0.011), and the seven-point scale at day 28 showed significant improvement in the USWD group (P = 0.003). While the rate of RNA negative conversion at day 7 (2/25 vs 7/25, p=0.054), day 14 (14/25 vs 18/25 p=0.239), day 21 (22/25 vs 18/25 p=0.279), and day 28 (25/25 vs 22/25 p=0.730) did not show statistical significance. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the AI-assisted CT analysis. No treatment-associated adverse events or worsening of pulmonary fibrosis were found.

ConclusionsAmong the 50 moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, the USWD as an adjunctive therapy to standard therapy could shorten the recovery course and enhance clinical improvement without aggravating pulmonary fibrosis. However, the study did not report statistical significance in the negative conversion rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid due to the small sample size and early termination, the findings of this study are limited.

463,Updated SARS-CoV-2 Single Nucleotide Variants and Mortality Association,"Since its outbreak in December 2019, COVID-19 has caused 100,5844,555 cases and 2,167,313 deaths as of Jan 27, 2021. Comparing our previous study of SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) before June 2020, we found out that the SNV clustering had changed considerably since June 2020. Apart from that the group SNVs represented by two non-synonymous mutations A23403G (S: D614G) and C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L) became dominant and carried by over 95% genomes, a few emerging groups of SNVs were recognized with sharply increased monthly occurrence ratios up to 70% in November 2020. Further investigation revealed that several SNVs were strongly associated with the mortality, but they presented distinct distribution in specific countries, e.g., Brazil, USA, Saudi Arabia, India, and Italy. SNVs including G25088T, T25A, G29861T and G29864A were adopted in a regularized logistic regression model to predict the mortality status in Brazil with the AUC of 0.84. Protein structure analysis showed that the emerging subgroups of non-synonymous SNVs and those mortality-related ones in Brazil were located on protein surface area. The clashes in protein structure introduced by these mutations might in turn affect virus pathogenesis through conformation changes, leading to the difference in transmission and virulence. Particularly, we found that SNVs tended to occur in intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs) of Spike (S) and ORF1ab, suggesting a critical role of SNVs in protein IDRs to determine protein folding and immune evasion.",Shuyi Fang; Sheng Liu; Jikui Shen; Alex Z Lu; Yucheng Zhang; Kailing Li; Juli Liu; Lei Yang; Chang-Deng Hu; Jun Wan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250757,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250757,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

465,Discontinuation of isolation for persons with COVID-19: Is 10 days really safe?,"BackgroundThe detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients is not a direct indication of the presence of viable viruses. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture system however, can acts as surrogate marker of infectiousness. Cell culture based studies performed mostly with hospitalized and moderate/severe COVID-19 claims that no replication competent virus is found after 9 days of the symptoms onset in respiratory samples. Therefore, it is now recommended 10 days isolation before patient discharge.

MethodsWe cell-cultured 29 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR positive respiratory samples at the 10th day after the illness in Vero E6 cells. After two passages, cytopathic effect and cycle threshold (CT) lower than the obtained in the original sample were used to determine positivity.

FindingsWe found viable particles in (7/29) 24% of samples tested. The positivity in cell culture was strongly associated (p<0.0001) to the low cycle thresholds in clinical samples (Ct <21).

466,A mathematical model to estimate percentage secondary infections from margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity: Useful tool for regulatory agencies to assess the risk of propagation due to false negative outcome of diagnostics,"False negative outcome of a diagnosis is one the major reasons for the dissemination of the diseases with high risk of propagation. Diagnostic sensitivity and the margin of error determine the false negative outcome of the diagnosis. A mathematical model had been developed to estimate the mean % secondary infections based on the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity, % prevalence and R0 value. This model recommends a diagnostic test with diagnostic sensitivity [&ge;] 96% and at least 92% lower bound limit of the 95% CI or [&le;] 4% margin of error for a highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 to curb the secondary transmission of the infection due to false negative cases. Positive relationship was found between mean % secondary infection and margin of error of sensitivity suggesting greater the margin of error of a diagnostic test sensitivity, higher the number of secondary infections in a population due to false negative cases. Negative correlation was found between number of COVID-19 test kits (>90% sensitivity) with regulatory approval and margin of error (R= -0.92, p=0.023) suggesting lesser the margin of error of a diagnostic test, higher the chances of getting approved by the regulatory agencies. However, there are no specific regulatory standards available for margin of error of the diagnostic sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Highly infectious disease such as COVID-19, certainly need specific regulatory standards on margin of error or 95% CI of the diagnostic sensitivity to curb the dissemination of the disease due to false negative cases and our model can be used to set the standards such as sensitivity, margin of error or lower bound limit of 95% CI.",Azhahianambi Palavesam; Karthik Kumaragurubaran; Aravindh Babu R Parthiban; Senthilkumar TMA; Balachandran Chidambaram; Dhinakar Raj Gopal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250804,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250804,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
467,MOATAI-VIR - an AI algorithm that predicts severe adverse events and molecular features for COVID-19's complications,"Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, some COVID-19 patients experience severe adverse events caused by pathogenic host responses. To treat these complications, their underlying etiology must be identified. Thus, a novel AI-based methodology, MOATAI-VIR, which predicts disease-protein-pathway relationships for 22 clinical manifestations attributed to COVID-19 was developed. SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins and GWAS identified respiratory failure associated risk genes provide the input from which the mode-of-action (MOA) proteins/pathways of the resulting disease comorbidities are predicted. These comorbidities are then mapped to their clinical manifestations. Three uncharacterized manifestation categories are found: neoplasms, mental and behavioral disorders, and congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. The prevalence of neoplasms suggests a possible association between COVID-19 and cancer, whether by shared molecular mechanisms between oncogenesis and viral replication, or perhaps, SARS-CoV-2 is an oncovirus. To assess the molecular basis of each manifestation, the proteins shared across each group of comorbidities were prioritized and subject to global pathway analysis. From these most frequent pathways, the molecular features associated with hallmark COVID-19 phenotypes, such as loss of sense of smell/taste, unusual neurological symptoms, cytokine storm, and blood clots were explored.

468,Retinol Depletion in Severe COVID-19,"Background and PurposeVitamin A is depleted during infections. Vitamin A has been used successfully in measles, RSV and AIDS patients and is an effective vaccine adjuvant. In this study, low retinol levels were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Retinoid signaling impairment in COVID-19 disrupts Type-I interferon synthesis.

Material and MethodTwo groups were formed in the study. The patient group consisted of 27 (Group 1) severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with respiratory failure, and the control group consisted of 23 (Group 2) patients without COVID-19 symptoms. Serum retinol levels were analyzed by ELIZA and HPLC in both groups.

FindingsRetinol levels were found to be significantly lower in the patient group (P <0.001). There was no difference in retinol between two different age groups in the patient group (P> 0.05). There was no significant difference in retinol between men and women (P> 0.05). Comorbidity did not affect serum retinol levels (P >0.05).

ConclusionSerum retinol levels were low in patients with severe COVID-19. Drugs preventing retinol excretion were not stopped in the patient group. Some patients took vitamin A externally. Despite this, retinol was low in COVID-19 patients. Retinol depletion impairs Type-I interferon synthesis by impairing retinoid signaling. Retinoid signaling may be the main pathogenetic disorder in COVID-19. This pathogenesis can serve as a guide for adjuvants, drug targets, and candidate drugs.

We developed a simplified and novel preparation method using a Chelex resin that obviates RNA extraction during viral testing. Direct detection RT-qPCR and digital-droplet PCR was compared to the current conventional method with RNA extraction for simulated samples and patient specimens. The heat-treatment in the presence of Chelex markedly improved detection sensitivity as compared to heat alone, and lack of RNA extraction shortens the overall diagnostic workflow.

470,Differential Cytokine Signatures of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Infection Highlight Key Differences in Pathobiology,"BackgroundSeveral inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in severe COVID-19. We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease.

MethodsThirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 145 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI on disease severity.

ResultsIL-18, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF- were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-{gamma}, IFN-{lambda}1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF- were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-{lambda}1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity.

ConclusionsThese findings point to activation of fundamentally different innate immune pathways in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection, and emphasize drivers of severe COVID-19 to focus both mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.

SummarySevere COVID-19 is marked by dysregulated inflammation and is associated with elevated BMI. By comparing cytokines and chemokines in patients with either COVID-19 or influenza, we identified distinct inflammatory pathways and a cytokine mediator of the effect of BMI.",Andrew H Karaba; Weiqiang Zhou; Leon L Hsieh; Alexis Figueroa; Guido Massaccesi; Richard E Rothman; Katherine ZJ Fenstermacher; Lauren Sauer; Kathryn Shaw-Saliba; Paul W Blair; Sherry Leung; Russell Wesson; Nada Alachkar; Ramy El-Diwany; Hongkai Ji; Andrea L Cox,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250317,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250317,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
471,Single Dose Vaccination in Healthcare Workers Previously Infected with SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine shortages have led some experts and countries to consider untested dosing regimens. We studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers (HCW) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and compared to them to antibody responses of HCW who were IgG negative to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. HCW with prior COVID-19 showed clear secondary antibody responses to vaccination with IgG spike binding titers rapidly increasing by 7 days and peaking by days 10 and 14 post-vaccination. At all time points tested, HCW with prior COVID-19 infection showed statistically significant higher antibody titers of binding and functional antibody compared to HCW without prior COVID-19 infection (p<.0001for each of the time points tested). In times of vaccine shortage, and until correlates of protection are identified, our findings preliminarily suggest the following strategy as more evidence-based: a) a single dose of vaccine for patients already having had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; and b) patients who have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.",Saman Saadat; Zahra Rikhtegaran-Tehrani; James Logue; Michelle Newman; Matthew B Frieman; Anthony D.

472,Diagnostic accuracy of PanbioTM rapid antigen tests on oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundAntigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities for testing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS.

Results402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2-86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) for the Ag-RDT.

For cycle threshold values [&le;] 26.7 ([&ge;] 1E6 SARS-CoV-2 genomes copies/mL, a presumed cut-off for infectious virus), 96.3% sensitivity (95%CI: 90.7-99.0%) was obtained with the Ag-RDT using OPS.

473,Under what circumstances could vaccination offset the harm from a more transmissible variant of SARS-COV-2 in NYC? Trade-offs regarding prioritization and speed of vaccination.,"IntroductionNew York City (NYC) was a global epicenter of COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 became available in December 2020 with limited supply, resulting in the need for policies regarding prioritization. The next month, SARS-CoV-2 variants were detected that were more transmissible but still vaccine-susceptible, raising scrutiny of these policies. In particular, prioritization of higher-risk people could prevent more deaths per dose of vaccine administered but could also delay herd immunity if the prioritization introduced bottlenecks that lowered vaccination speed (the number of doses that could be delivered per day). We used mathematical modeling to examine the trade-off between prioritization and the vaccination speed.

MethodsA stochastic, discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model with age- and comorbidity-adjusted COVID-19 outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by July 1, 2021) was used to examine the trade-off between vaccination speed and whether or not vaccination was prioritized to individuals age 65+ and ""essential workers,"" defined as including first responders and healthcare, transit, education, and public safety workers. The model was calibrated to COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital census, ICU census, and deaths in NYC. Vaccination speed was assumed to be 10,000 doses per day starting December 15th, 2020 targeting healthcare workers and nursing home populations, and to subsequently expand at alternative starting times and speeds. We compared COVID-outcomes across alternative expansion starting times (January 15th, January 21st, or February 1st) and speeds (20,000, 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, or 200,000 doses per day for the first dose), as well as alternative prioritization options (""yes"" versus ""no"" prioritization of essential workers and people age 65+). Model projections were produced with and without considering the emergence of a SARS-COV-2 variant with 56% greater transmissibility over January and February, 2021.

ResultsIn the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, the emergence of the more transmissible variant would triple the peak in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths and more than double cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. To offset the harm from the more transmissible variant would require reaching a vaccination speed of at least 100,000 doses per day by January 15th or 150,000 per day by January 21st. Prioritizing people ages 65+ and essential workers increased the number of lives saved per vaccine dose delivered: with the emergence of a more transmissible variant, 8,000 deaths could be averted by delivering 115,000 doses per day without prioritization or 71,000 doses per day with prioritization. If prioritization were to cause a bottleneck in vaccination speed, more lives would be saved with prioritization only if the bottleneck reduced vaccination speed by less than one-third of the maximum vaccine delivery capacity. These trade-offs between vaccination speed and prioritization were robust over a wide range of delivery capacity.

ConclusionsThe emergence of a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to triple the 2021 epidemic peak and more than double the 2021 COVID-19 burden in NYC. Vaccination could only offset the harm of the more transmissible variant if high speed were achieved in mid-to late January. Prioritization of COVID-19 vaccines to higher-risk populations saves more lives only if it does not create an excessive vaccine delivery bottleneck.",Hae-Young Kim; Anna Bershteyn; Jessica McGillen; R.

474,Genetically predicted serum vitamin D and COVID-19: a Mendelian randomization study,"ObjectivesTo investigate causality of the association of serum vitamin D with the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection.

DesignTwo-sample Mendelian randomization study.

SettingSummary data from genome-wide analyses in the population-based UK Biobank and SUNLIGHT Consortium, applied to meta-analyzed results of genome-wide analyses in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative.

Participants17,965 COVID-19 cases including 11,085 laboratory or physician confirmed cases, 7,885 hospitalized cases, and 4,336 severe respiratory cases, and 1,370,547 controls, primarily of European ancestry.

ExposuresGenetically predicted variation in serum vitamin D status, based on genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum vitamin D or risk of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency.

Main outcome measuresSusceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection, including severe respiratory infection and hospitalization.

ResultsMendelian randomization analysis, powered to detect moderate effects comparable to those seen in observational studies, provided little to no evidence for an effect of genetically predicted serum vitamin D on susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19 infection. Using SNPs in loci related to vitamin D metabolism as proxies for serum vitamin D concentration, the odds ratio for a standard deviation increase in serum vitamin D was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.18) for any COVID-19 infection versus population controls, 1.05 (0.84-1.31) for hospitalized COVID-19 versus population controls, 0.96 (0.64 to 1.43) for severe respiratory COVID-19 versus population controls, 1.15 (0.99 to 1.35) for COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative, and 1.44 (0.75 to 2.78) for hospitalized COVID-19 versus non-hospitalized COVID-19. Results were similar in analyses that used all SNPs with genome-wide significant associations with serum vitamin D (i.e., including SNPs in loci with no known relationship to vitamin D metabolism) and in analyses using SNPs with genome-wide significant associations with risk of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that genetically predicted differences in long-term vitamin D nutritional status do not causally affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection, and that associations observed in previous studies may have been driven by confounding. These results do not exclude the possibility of low-magnitude causal effects, nor do they preclude potential causal effects of acute responses to therapeutic doses of vitamin D.

475,Identification of B.1.346 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan: Genomic evidence of re-entry of Clade 20C,"ObjectivesWhole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing from COVID-19 patients is useful for infection control and regional trends evaluation. We report a lineage data collected from hospitals in the Kanto region of Japan.

MethodsWe performed whole genome sequencing in specimens of 198 COVID-19 patients at 13 collaborating hospitals in the Kanto region. Phylogenetic analysis and fingerprinting of the nucleotide substitutions underwent to differentiate and classify the viral lineages.

ResultsMore than 90% of the strains belonged to Clade 20B and two lineages (B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214) have been detected predominantly in the Kanto region. However, one sample from a COVID-19 patient in November 2020, belonged to the B.1.346 lineage of Clade 20C, which has been prevalent in western United States. The patient had no history of overseas travel and no contact with anyone who had travelled abroad, suggesting that this strain appeared likely to have been imported from western United States, across the strict quarantine barrier.

ConclusionB.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214 have been identified predominantly in the Kanto region and B.1.346 of clade 20C in one patient was probably imported from western United States. These results illustrate that a decentralized network of hospitals can be significantly advantageous for monitoring regional molecular epidemiologic trends.

476,Aerosol emission from the respiratory tract: an analysis of relative risks from oxygen delivery systems,"BackgroundRisk of aerosolisation of SARS-CoV-2 directly informs organisation of acute healthcare and PPE guidance. Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) are widely used modes of oxygen delivery and respiratory support for patients with severe COVID-19, with both considered as high risk aerosol generating procedures. However, there are limited high quality experimental data characterising aerosolisation during oxygen delivery and respiratory support.

MethodsHealthy volunteers were recruited to breathe, speak, and cough in ultra-clean, laminar flow theatres followed by using oxygen and respiratory support systems. Aerosol emission was measured using two discrete methodologies, simultaneously. Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 were also recruited and had aerosol emissions measured during breathing, speaking, and coughing.

FindingsIn healthy volunteers (n = 25 subjects; 531 measures), CPAP (with exhalation port filter) produced less aerosols than breathing, speaking and coughing (even with large >50L/m facemask leaks). HFNO did emit aerosols, but the majority of these particles were generated from the HFNO machine, not the patient. HFNO-generated particles were small (<1m), passing from the machine through the patient and to the detector without coalescence with respiratory aerosol, thereby unlikely to carry viral particles. Coughing was associated with the highest aerosol emissions with a peak concentration at least 10 times greater the mean concentration generated from speaking or breathing. Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (n = 8 subjects; 56 measures) had similar size distributions to healthy volunteers.

InterpretationIn healthy volunteers, CPAP is associated with less aerosol emission than breathing, speaking or coughing. Aerosol emission from the respiratory tract does not appear to be increased by HFNO. Although direct comparisons are complex, cough appears to generate significant aerosols in a size range compatible with airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As a consequence, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation is likely to be high in all areas where patients with Covid-19 are coughing. Guidance on personal protective equipment policy should reflect these updated risks.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPubMed was searched from inception until 10/1/21 using the terms  aerosol, and variations of  non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and  high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Studies were included if they measured aerosol generated from volunteers or patients receiving non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) or high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO), or provided experimental evidence on a simulated human setting. One study was identified (Gaeckle et al, 2020) which measured aerosol emission with one methodology (APS) but was limited by high background concentration of aerosol and a low number of participants (n = 10).

Added value of this studyThis study used multiple methodologies to measure aerosol emission from the respiratory tract before and during CPAP and high-flow nasal oxygen, in an ultra-clean, laminar flow theatre with near-zero background aerosol and recruited patients with COVID-19 to ensure similar aerosol distributions. We conclude that there is negligible aerosol generation with CPAP, that aerosol emission from HFNO is from the machine and not the patient, coughing emits aerosols consistent with airborne transmission of SARS CoV2 and that healthy volunteers are a reasonable proxy for COVID-19 patients.

Implications of all the available evidenceCPAP and HFNO should not be considered high risk aerosol generating procedures, based on our study and that of Gaeckle et al. Recorded aerosol emission from HFNO stems from the machine. Cough remains a significant aerosol risk.

477,Impact of public sentiments on the transmission of COVID-19 across a geographical gradient,"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a recently discovered, novel coronavirus, SARS-COV2. The disease has led to over 81 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, with close to 2 million deaths. In the current social climate, the risk of COVID-19 infection is driven by individual and public perception of risk and sentiments. A number of factors influences public perception, including an individual's belief system, prior knowledge about a disease and information about a disease. In this paper, we develop a model for COVID-19 using a system of ordinary differential equations following the natural history of the infection. The model uniquely incorporates social behavioral aspects such as quarantine and quarantine violation. The model is further driven by people's sentiments (positive and negative) which accounts for the influence of disinformation. People's sentiments were obtained by parsing through and analyzing COVID-19 related tweets from Twitter, a social media platform across six countries. Our results show that our model incorporating public sentiments is able to capture the trend in the trajectory of the epidemic curve of the reported cases. Furthermore, our results show that positive public sentiments reduce disease burden in the community. Our results also show that quarantine violation and early discharge of the infected population amplifies the disease burden on the community. Hence, it is important to account for public sentiment and individual social behavior in epidemic models developed to study diseases like COVID-19.",Folashade Agusto; Eric Numfor; Karthik Srinivasan; Enahoro Iboi; Alexander Fulk; Jarron M.

Using an RT-PCR or rapid antigen test to ""test out"" of quarantine is a frequently proposed strategy to shorten duration without increasing risk. We calculated the probability that infected individuals test negative for SARS-CoV-2 on a particular day post-infection and remain symptom free for some period of time. We estimate that an infected individual has a 20.1% chance (95% CI 9.8-32.6) of testing RT-PCR negative on day five post-infection and remaining asymptomatic until day seven. We also show that the added information a test provides decreases as we move further from the test date, hence a less sensitive test that returns rapid results is often preferable to a more sensitive test with a delay.",Lucy D'Agostino McGowan; Elizabeth C.

479,Predicting Prognosis in COVID-19 Patients using Machine Learning and Readily Available Clinical Data,"RationalePrognostic tools for aiding in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients could help improve outcome by identifying patients at higher or lower risk of severe disease.

ObjectivesThe study objective was to develop models to stratify patients by risk of severe outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalization using readily available information at hospital admission.

MethodsHierarchical ensemble classification models were trained on a set of 229 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to predict severe outcomes, including ICU admission, development of ARDS, or intubation, using easily attainable attributes including basic patient characteristics, vital signs at admission, and basic lab results collected at time of presentation. Each test stratifies patients into groups of increasing risk. An additional cohort of 330 patients was used for blinded, independent validation. Shapley value analysis evaluated which attributes contributed most to the models predictions of risk.

Measurements and Main ResultsTest performance was assessed using precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity) of the final risk groups. All test cut-offs were fixed prior to blinded validation. In both development and validation, the tests achieved precision in the lowest risk groups near or above 0.9. The proportion of patients with severe outcomes significantly increased across increasing risk groups. While the importance of attributes varied by test and patient, CRP, LDH, and D-dimer were often found to be important in the assignment of risk label.

480,"""This is really like waiting for war and this is not good"" - Intertwining between pandemic experiences, and the development of professional action of healthcare professionals in critical care at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: a qualitative study","Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are facing remarkable challenges in their daily work since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Being well prepared is crucial for dealing with such a pandemic. The aim of our study was to explore HCPs subjective perspectives on their professional action and coping strategies in critical care during the preparation and coping phase after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.

Together with HCPs working in critical care, we collaboratively designed an interview study based on an ethnomethodological approach. We performed semi-structured qualitative interviews via telephone or video call and analysed the data based on grounded theory.

Our research interest was focused on HCPs (qualified nurses, physicians, medical students) working in critical care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany between April and July 2020.

Our sample consisted of 39 HCPs (19 nurses, 17 physicians, three medical students, 18/39 female) from ten German federal states. All participants were involved in the acute care of COVID-19 infected patients in hospitals and had a mean professional experience of 14.8{+/-}10.1 years, 15 participants held a management position (e.g. senior physician or head nurse). We recruited participants via personal contacts and snowballing.

Initial and focused coding resulted in seven categories: Creating structural measures, handling operational changes, dealing with personal protective equipment, building up knowledge and skills, managing information, perceiving peer support and experiencing emotions.

Professional action and subjectively perceived preparedness (professional and emotional) interacted with each other.

481,Accuracy of four lateral flow immunoassays for anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: a head-to-head comparative study,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are used for population surveillance and might have a future role in individual risk assessment. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver results rapidly and at scale, but have widely varying accuracy.

MethodsIn a laboratory setting, we performed head-to-head comparisons of four LFIAs: the Rapid Test Consortiums AbC-19 Rapid Test, OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, and Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. We analysed blood samples from 2,847 key workers and 1,995 pre-pandemic blood donors with all four devices.

FindingsWe observed a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity: the IgG band of the SureScreen device and the AbC-19 device had higher specificities but OrientGene and Biomerica higher sensitivities. Based on analysis of pre-pandemic samples, SureScreen IgG band had the highest specificity (98.9%, 95% confidence interval 98.3 to 99.3%), which translated to the highest positive predictive value across any pre-test probability: for example, 95.1% (95%CI 92.6, 96.8%) at 20% pre-test probability. All four devices showed higher sensitivity at higher antibody concentrations (""spectrum effects""), but the extent of this varied by device.

InterpretationThe estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be used to adjust for test error rates when using these devices to estimate the prevalence of antibody. If tests were used to determine whether an individual has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in an example scenario in which 20% of individuals have antibodies we estimate around 5% of positive results on the most specific device would be false positives.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched for evidence on the accuracy of the four devices compared in this study: OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test and the UK Rapid Test Consortiums AbC-19 Rapid Test. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily), PubMed, MedRxiv/BioRxiv and Google Scholar from January 2020 to 16th January 2021. Search terms included device names AND ((SARS-CoV-2) OR (covid)). Of 303 records assessed, data were extracted from 24 studies: 18 reporting on the accuracy of the OrientGene device, 7 SureScreen, 2 AbC-19 and 1 Biomerica. Only three studies compared the accuracy of two or more of the four devices. With the exception of our previous report on the accuracy of the AbC-19 device, which the current manuscript builds upon, sample size ranged from 7 to 684. For details, see Supplementary Materials.

The largest study compared OrientGene, SureScreen and Biomerica. SureScreen was estimated to have the highest specificity (99.8%, 95% CI 98.9 to 100%) and OrientGene the highest sensitivity (92.6%), but with uncertainty about the latter result due to small sample sizes. The other two comparative studies were small (n = 65, n = 67) and therefore provide very uncertain results.

We previously observed spectrum effects for the AbC-19 device, such that sensitivity is upwardly biased if estimated only from PCR-confirmed cases. The vast majority of previous studies estimated sensitivity in this way.

Added value of this studyWe performed a large scale (n = 4,842), head-to-head laboratory-based evaluation and comparison of four lateral flow devices, which were selected for evaluation by the UK Department of Health and Social Cares New Tests Advisory Group, on the basis of a survey of test and performance data available. We evaluated the performance of diagnosis based on both IgG and IgM bands, and the IgG band alone. We found a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across devices, with the SureScreen and AbC-19 devices being more specific and OrientGene and Biomerica more sensitive. Based on analysis of 1,995 pre-pandemic blood samples, we are 99% confident that SureScreen (IgG band reading) has the highest specificity of the four devices (98.9%, 95% CI 98.3, 99.3%).

We found evidence that all four devices have reduced sensitivity at lower antibody indices, i.e. spectrum effects. However, the extent of this varies by device and appears to be less for other devices than for AbC-19.

Our estimates of sensitivity and specificity are likely to be higher than would be observed in real use of these devices, as they were based on majority readings of three trained laboratory personnel.

Implications of all the available evidenceWhen used in epidemiological studies of antibody prevalence, the estimates of sensitivity and specificity provided in this study can be used to adjust for test errors. Increased precision in error rates will translate to increased precision in seroprevalence estimates. If lateral flow devices were used for individual risk assessment, devices with maximum specificity would be preferable. However, if, for an example, 20% of the tested population had antibodies, we estimate that around 1 in 20 positive results on the most specific device would be incorrect.",Hayley E Jones; Ranya Mulchandani; Sian Taylor-Phillips; A E Ades; Justin Shute; Keith Perry; Nastassya Chandra; Tim Brooks; Andre Charlett; Matthew Hickman; Isabel Oliver; Stephen Kaptoge; John Danesh; Emanuele Di Angelantonio; - COMPARE Study investigators; - EDSAB-HOME investigators; David H WYLLIE,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250777,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250777,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
482,COVID-19 Hospitalizations in Five California Hospitals,"STRUCTURED ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSCharacterization of a diverse cohort hospitalized with COVID-19 in a health care system in California is needed to further understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and improve patient outcomes.

ObjectivesTo investigate the characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and assess factors associated with poor outcomes.

DesignPatient-level retrospective cohort study

SettingUniversity of California five academic hospitals.

ParticipantsPatients [&ge;]18 years old with a confirmed test result for SAR-CoV-2 virus hospitalized at five UC hospitals.

ExposureConfirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive results on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring hospital admission.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAdmission to the intensive care unit, death during hospitalization, and the composite of both outcomes.

ResultsOutcomes were assessed for 4,730 patients who were discharged or died during a hospitalization. A total of 846 patients were treated at UC Davis, 1,564 UC Irvine, 1,283 UC Los Angeles, 471 UC San Diego, and 566 UC San Francisco. More than 20% of patients were [&ge;]75 years of age (75-84: 12.3%, [&ge;]85: 10.5%), male (56.5%), Hispanic/Latino (45.7%), and Asian (10.3%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (35.2%), cardiac disease (33.3%), and diabetes (24.0%). The ICU admission rate was 25.2% (1194/4730), with 7.0% (329/4730) in-hospital mortality. Among patients admitted to the ICU, 18.8% (225/1194) died; 2.9% (104/3536) died without ICU admission. The rate of the composite outcome (ICU admission and/or death) was 27.4% (1,298/4,730). While controlling for comorbidities, patients of age 75-84 (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.11-1.93) and 85-59 (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.87) were more likely to experience a composite outcome than 18-34 year-olds. Males (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.21-1.59), and patients identifying as Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.14-1.61), and Asian (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.23-1.82), were also more likely to experience a composite outcome than White. Patients with 5 or more comorbidities were exceedingly likely to experience a composite outcome (OR 2.74, 95% CI: 2.32-3.25).

ConclusionsMales, older patients, those with pre-existing comorbidities, and those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or Asian experienced an increased risk of ICU admission and/or death.

483,Strategies for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently bring R<1,"With limited availability of vaccines, an efficient use of the limited supply of vaccines in order to achieve herd immunity will be an important tool to combat the wide-spread prevalence of COVID-19. Here, we propose a targeted vaccination approach (EHR) that provides a significant reduction in the necessary number of doses needed achieve herd immunity compared to age-prioritized and random selection vaccination schemes. Using high-fidelity individual-based computer simulations with Oslo, Norway as an example, we find that for a community reproductive number in a setting where R=1.4 without population immunity, the EHR method reaches herd immunity at only 15% of the population vaccinated, whereas the common age-prioritized approach needs 40%. With R=1.9 in the absence of immunity, EHR needs 30% and age-prioritized needs 52%.",Andre Voigt; Stig William Omholt; Eivind Almaas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250828,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250828,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

Here I measured longitudinal time-series correlations between outdoor temperature, humidity and covid-19 reproduction number (Rt) in the 50 U.S. states (+DC). In order to mitigate the confounding influence of varying social restriction measures, the analysis spans a 5-month period during summer and autumn 2020 when restrictions were comparatively lower and more stable. I used a cross-covariance approach to account for a variable delay between infection and case report. For a delay near 11 days, most U.S. states exhibited a negative correlation between outdoor temperature and Rt, as well as between absolute humidity and Rt (mean r = -0.35). In 21 states, the correlation was strong (r < -0.5). Individual state data are presented, and associations between cold and/or dry weather episodes and short-term new case surges are proposed. After identifying potential confounding factors, I discuss 3 possible causal mechanisms that could explain a correlation between outdoor weather and indoor disease transmission: behavioral adaptations to cold weather, respiratory tract temperature, and the importing of outdoor absolute humidity to indoor spaces.",Emmanuel de Margerie,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250793,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250793,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True

486,Understanding soaring coronavirus cases and the effect of contagion policies in the UK,"The number of new daily SARS-CoV-2 infections is frantically rising in almost every country of the EU. The phenomenological explanation offered is a new mutation of the virus, first identified in the UK. We use publicly available data in combination with a controlled SIR model, which captures the effects of preventive measures on the active cases, to show that the current wave of infections is consistent with a single transmission rate. This suggests that the new SARS-CoV-2 variant is as transmissible as previous strains. Our findings indicate that the relaxation of preventive measures is closely related with the ongoing surge in cases. We simulate the effects of new restrictions and vaccination campaigns in 2021, demonstrating that lockdown policies are not fully effective to flatten the curve. For effective mitigation, it is critical that the public keeps on high alert until vaccination reaches a critical threshold.",Miguel A Duran-Olivencia; Serafim Kalliadasis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250822,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250822,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
487,Impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the postpartum experience of women living in Eastern Canada: A mixed method cohort study,"ObjectivesTo (1) compare changes in self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression in Canadian women collected before (Cohort 1) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cohort 2); (2) explore the women felt related to having a newborn during the pandemic; and (3) explore ways that women coped.

MethodsPrior to the pandemic (October 1, 2019-January 1, 2020), an online survey was conducted with women had given birth within the past six months in one of the three Eastern Canadian Maritime provinces (Cohort 1). A second, similar survey was conducted between August 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020 (Cohort 2) during a period of provincial pandemic response to COVID-19.

ResultsFor Cohort 1, 561 women completed the survey and 331 women in Cohort 2. Cohorts were similar in terms of age of women, parity, and age of newborn. There were no significant differences for self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety, and depression between the cohorts. Difficulties that women reported as a result of COVID-19 restrictions included lack of support from family and friends, fear of COVID-19 exposure, feeling isolated and uncertain, negative impact on perinatal care experience, and hospital restrictions. Having support from partners and families, in-person/virtual support, as well as self-care and the low prevalence of COVID-19 during the summer of 2020 helped women cope.

ConclusionWhile there was no significant difference in pre-pandemic and during pandemic psychosocial outcomes, there were still challenges and negative impacts that women identified. Consideration of vulnerable populations is important when making public health recommendations.

What is already known on this subject?Previous work has shown the importance of social support in the postpartum transition in developing parenting self-efficacy and decreasing postpartum anxiety and depression. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, womens mental health, particularly during the perinatal period, has seen an increases in rates of postpartum anxiety and depression.

What this study adds?This study is able to compare self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and depression between two cohorts of postpartum women living in Eastern Canada - pre-COVID-19 pandemic and during.

488,Prognosis and hematological findings in patients with COVID-19 in an Amazonian population of Peru,"ObjectiveThis study examined the laboratory results of COVID-19 patients from a hospital in the Peruvian Amazon and their clinical prognosis.

MethodsAn analytical cross-sectional study was carried out whose purpose was to identify the laboratory tests of patients with COVID-19 and mortality in a hospital in Ucayali, Peru during the period from March 13 to May 9, 2020, selecting a total of 127 with Covid-19. Mean and the standard deviation was described for age, leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets, RDW-SD; median and interquartile range for the variables lymphocyte, RN / L, fibrinogen, CRP, D-dimer, DHL, hematocrit, monocytes, eosinophils.

ResultsNo differences were observed in this population regarding death and sex (OR: 1.31; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.87), however, it was observed that, for each one-year increase, the probability of death increased by 4% (PR: 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.05). The IRR (Incidence Risk Ratio) analysis for the numerical variables showed results strongly associated with hematological values such as Leukocytes (scaled by 2500 units) (IRR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13), neutrophils (scaled by 2500 units) (IRR: 1.08; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13), on the contrary, it is observed that the increase of 1000 units in lymphocytes, the probability of dying decreased by 48% (IRR: 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 071).

489,Immuno-fibrotic drivers of impaired lung function in post-COVID-19 syndrome,"IntroductionSubjects recovering from COVID-19 frequently experience persistent respiratory ailments; however, little is known about the underlying biological factors that may direct lung recovery and the extent to which these are affected by COVID-19 severity.

MethodsWe performed a prospective cohort study of subjects with persistent symptoms after recovering from acute COVID-19 illness, collecting clinical data, pulmonary function tests, and blood. Plasma samples were used for multiplex profiling of circulating factors associated with inflammation, metabolism, angiogenesis, and fibrosis.

ResultsSixty-one subjects were enrolled across two academic medical centers at a median of 9 weeks (interquartile range 6-10) after COVID-19 illness: n=13 subjects (21%) mild/non-hospitalized, n=30 (49%) hospitalized/non-critical, and n=18 subjects (30%) hospitalized/intensive care (""ICU""). Fifty-three subjects (85%) had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea (69%) and cough (58%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined as COVID-19 severity increased (P<0.05), but did not correlate with respiratory symptoms. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered subjects by past COVID-19 severity. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) identified by the model were significantly higher in the ICU group (P<0.05) and inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO (P<0.05).

ConclusionsSubjective respiratory symptoms are common after acute COVID-19 illness but do not correlate with COVID-19 severity or pulmonary function. Host response profiles reflecting neutrophil activation (LCN2), fibrosis signaling (MMP-7), and alveolar repair (HGF) track with lung impairment and may be novel therapeutic or prognostic targets.

490,Persistent COVID-19 symptoms minimally impact the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity,"SARS-CoV-2 represents an unprecedented public health challenge with many unknowns remaining regarding the factors that impact viral pathogenicity and the development of immunity after infection. While the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 resolve their infection with few complications, a significant number of individuals experienced prolonged symptoms lasting for weeks after initial diagnosis. Persistent viral infections are commonly accompanied by immunologic dysregulation, especially within the cellular immune compartment. However, it is unclear if persistent mild-to-moderate COVID-19 impacts the development of virus-specific cellular immunity. To this end, we analyzed the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity in convalescent COVID-19 patients who experienced eight days or fewer of COVID-19 symptoms, or symptoms persisting for 18 days or more. We observed that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms minimally impacts the magnitude, antigen specificity, and transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity within both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments. Furthermore, we observed that reactivity against the structural N protein from SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent COVID-19 patients correlates with the amount of reactivity against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. These results provide additional insight into the complex processes that regulate the development of cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and related human coronaviruses.",HengSheng Fang; Adam D Wegman; Kianna Ripich; Heather Friberg; Jeffrey Currier; Stephen J Thomas; Timothy P Endy; Adam Waickman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250771,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250771,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,,True
491,Using time use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of COVID-19 social restrictions,"We present analyses of 24-hour time use diary records of the UK populations activities, their social context and their location, collected in real time from four successive waves of representative UK samples, both before, and during, the current COVID-19 pandemic. We show changes in behavioral response to social restrictions at three time-points during the pandemic, including across two nationwide lockdowns. Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the populations activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded May- June 2020). Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown. Disaggregating by gender and age group, the difference was found to be statistically significant for all groups, with the exception of those aged 55 and over.

Significance statementWhat do people do during lockdown? This set of data is unique in providing time use diary information in real time on changing behavior in the UK in response to each major change in social restrictions. This enables us to directly compare 24-hour continuous and comprehensive information on the populations activities, their social context and their location, comparing risk- related behavior during different phases of social restrictions. Holding constant gender, age and social grade, we show that the UK population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in the second UK lockdown in November 2020 than in first lockdown (starting March 2020).

492,Minimizing loss of life in Covid-19 in a 100 day period in the U.S.A. by age-tailored dosing and distribution of a limited vaccine supply,"Background

We aimed at minimizing loss of lives in the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA by identifying optimal vaccination strategies during a 100-day period with limited vaccine supplies. While lethality is highest in the elderly, transmission and case numbers are highest in the younger. A strategy of first vaccinating the elderly is widely used, thought to protect the vulnerable, elderly best. Despite lower immunogenicity in the elderly, mRNA vaccines retain high efficacy, implying that in the younger, reduced vaccine doses might suffice, thereby increasing vaccination counts with a given vaccine supply.

Methods

Using published immunogenicity data of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, we examined the value of personalized-dose vaccination strategies, using a modeling approach incorporating age-related vaccine immunogenicity, social contact patterns, population structure, Covid-19 case and death rates in the USA in late January 2021. An increase if the number of persons that can be vaccinated and a potential reduction of the individual protective efficacy was accounted for.

Results

Age-personalized dosing strategies reduced cases faster, shortening the pandemic, reducing the delay to reaching <100000 cases/day from 64 to 30 days and avoiding 25000 deaths within 100 days in the USA. In an ""elderly first"" vaccination strategy, mortality is higher even in the elderly. Findings were robust with transmission blocking efficacies of reduced dose vaccination between 30% to 90%, and with a vaccine supply from 1 to 3 million full dose vaccinations per day.

Conclusion

Rapid reduction of Covid-19 case and death rate in the USA in 100 days with a limited vaccine supply is best achieved when personalized, age-tailored dosing for highly effective vaccines is used.

In this short report, we show that the antibody response to the first vaccine dose in individuals with pre-existing immunity is equal to or even exceeds the titers found in naive individuals after the second dose. We also show that the reactogenicity is significantly higher in individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past.

We performed in silico analysis of structures of two most frequent SARS-COV-2 mutations, namely, N501Y and E484K, to identify plausible basis of their fitness over the original strain. The analysis suggested that the N501Y mutation is associated with strengthening of intra- as well as intermolecular H-bond in the hACE2 receptor-spike protein complex, which could result in increased affinity and, therefore, higher infectivity. While E484K mutation did not seem to directly affect the binding with hACE2 receptor, it disrupted H-bonding and salt-bridge interaction associated with binding with neutralizing antibody, which could affect chance of re-infection, disease outcome. Survey of several other mutations showing reduction in antibody-mediated neutralization also revealed that similar disruption of H-bonding or salt-bridge or Van der Waals interaction might explain their phenotype. Analysis of GESS database indicated that N501Y, EK484 as well as these other mutations existed since March-April, 2020, might have evolved independently across the world and may keep accumulating, which could affect efficacy of vaccination and antibody-based therapies. Our analysis also indicated that these may spread in spite of current travel restrictions focused on few countries and evolve indigenously warranting intensification of surveillance for emerging mutations among all travellers as well as people in their dwelling zones. Meta-analysis of existing literature showed that repeat testing of travellers, contacts and others under scrutiny 7-11 days after the initial RT-PCR test may significantly help to contain the spread of emerging variants by catching false negative results. In addition, existing evidence calls for development of strain-specific tests, escalated sequencing and broadening the scope of surveillance including in hospitals and animal farms to contain the threat of emerging variants.",Sk Ramiz Islam; Debasish Prusty; Soumen Kanti Manna,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250666,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250666,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True

However, the literature exploring the effectiveness of homemade fabric face masks is still in its infancy. Developing an evidence base is an important step to ensure that public policy is evidence based and truly effective.

MethodsTwo methodologies were used in this study: quantitative fit testing of various face masks to indicate their effectiveness and a survey of 710 US residents about their perceptions of face mask effectiveness. N95, surgical and two fabric face masks were tested on an individual twenty five times each using a TSI 8038+ machine. Our survey was distributed by Qualtrics XM, asking participants to estimate the effectiveness of N95, surgical and fabric face masks.

Results and DiscussionOur results indicate that fabric face masks blocked between 62.6% and 87.1% of fine particles, whereas surgical masks protected against an average of 78.2% of fine particles.

497,High-dimensional profiling reveals phenotypic heterogeneity and disease-specific alterations of granulocytes in COVID-19,"Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that the innate immune responses play an important role in the disease development. A dysregulated inflammatory state has been proposed as key driver of clinical complications in COVID-19, with a potential detrimental role of granulocytes. However, a comprehensive phenotypic description of circulating granulocytes in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is lacking. In this study, we used high-dimensional flow cytometry for granulocyte immunophenotyping in peripheral blood collected from COVID-19 patients during acute and convalescent phases. Severe COVID-19 was associated with increased levels of both mature and immature neutrophils, and decreased counts of eosinophils and basophils. Distinct immunotypes were evident in COVID-19 patients, with altered expression of several receptors involved in activation, adhesion and migration of granulocytes (e.g. CD62L, CD11a/b, CD69, CD63, CXCR4). Paired sampling revealed recovery and phenotypic restoration of the granulocytic signature in the convalescent phase. The identified granulocyte immunotypes correlated with distinct sets of soluble inflammatory markers supporting pathophysiologic relevance. Furthermore, clinical features, including multi-organ dysfunction and respiratory function, could be predicted using combined laboratory measurements and immunophenotyping. This study provides a comprehensive granulocyte characterization in COVID-19 and reveals specific immunotypes with potential predictive value for key clinical features associated with COVID-19.

SignificanceAccumulating evidence shows that granulocytes are key modulators of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their dysregulation could significantly impact COVID-19 severity and patient recovery after virus clearance. In the present study, we identify selected immune traits in neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil subsets associated to severity of COVID-19 and to peripheral protein profiles. Moreover, computational modeling indicates that the combined use of phenotypic data and laboratory measurements can effectively predict key clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Finally, patient-matched longitudinal analysis shows phenotypic normalization of granulocyte subsets 4 months after hospitalization. Overall, in this work we extend the current understanding of the distinct contribution of granulocyte subsets to COVID-19 pathogenesis.",Magda Lourda; Majda Dzidic; Laura Hertwig; Helena Bergsten; Laura M Palma Medina; Egle Kvedaraite; Jagadeeswara Rao Muvva; Jean-Baptiste Gorin; Martin Cornillet; Johanna Emgard; Kirsten Moll; Marina Garcia; Kimia T Maleki; Jonas Klingstrom; Jakob Michaelsson; Malin Flodstrom-Tullberg; Susanna Brighenti; Marcus Buggert; Jenny Mjosberg; Karl-Johan Malmberg; Johan K Sandberg; Jan-Inge Henter; Elin Folkesson; Sara Gredmark-Russ; Anders Sonnerborg; Lars I Eriksson; Olav Rooyackers; Soo Aleman; Kristoffer Stralin; Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren; Niklas K Bjorkstrom; Mattias Svensson; Andrea Ponzetta; Anna Norrby-Teglund; Benedict J Chambers; - Karolinska KI/K COVID-19 Study Group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250591,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250591,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
498,Modeling the asymptomatic prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and the ISTAT survey,"objectivesAugust 3rd, 2020, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) presented preliminary results of seroprevalence survey on the percentage of individuals affected by Covid-19. The survey aims to define (within the entire population of Italy) the portion of individuals that developed an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. For the first time one has an estimate of the asymptomatic infected population and the possibility to acknowledge its potential role in the infection spread in Italy, one of the most affected areas in Europe. The information obtained allow a particularly sensitive validation of epidemiological models which include the asymptomatic class.

methodsThe present study is devoted to the construction of a model able to simulate, in a systematic way, the asymptomatic group whose relevance in the, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, has been recently investigated and discussed. The investigation involves the description of the first epidemic outbreak in Italy as well as the predictive analysis of the ongoing second wave. In particular the possible correction to the data of the serological tests because of their sensitivity and specificity.

resultsThe model: taken as an example of the models presently used, satisfactory reproduces the data of the ISTAT survey showing a relevant predictive power and relegating in a secondary position models which do not include, in the simulation, the presence of asymptomatic groups. The corrections due to the serological test sensitivity (in particular those ones depending on the symptoms onset) make the comparison between data and models less accurate.

conclusionsThe predictions of the model confirm a relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals also during the second pandemic wave in Italy. The ratio of reported to unreported cases is predicted to be roughly 1:4. A more detailed knowledge of the results of the survey could allow to correct, in a relevant way, the data by means of the experimental evidences on the antibodies sensibility. The model analyses of the vaccination strategies, confirms the relevance of a massive administration with the beginning of the year to arrive at the end of the infection within August 2021.",Marco Claudio Traini; Carla Caponi; Riccardo Ferrari; Giuseppe Vittorio De Socio,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250597,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250597,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
499,Neighbourhood-level risk factors of COVID-19 incidence and mortality,"BackgroundRacialized and low income communities face disproportionally high rates of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death. However, data on inequities in COVID-19 across granular categories of socio-demographic characteristics is more sparse.

MethodsNeighbourhood-level counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ontario, Canada recorded as of July 28th, 2020 were extracted from provincial and local reportable infectious disease surveillance systems. Associations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality and 18 neighbourhood-level measures of immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics were estimated with Poisson generalized linear mixed models. Housing characteristic variables were subsequently added to models to explore if housing may have a confounding influence on the relationships between immigration, race, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence.

ResultsThere were large inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality across the socio-demographic variables examined. Neighbourhoods having a higher proportion immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status were associated with COVID-19 risk. Adjusting for housing characteristics, especially unsuitably crowded housing, attenuated COVID-19 risks. However persistent risk remained for neighbourhoods having high proportions of immigrants, racialized populations, and proportion of Black, Latin American, and South Asian residents.

ConclusionsSocio-demographic factors account for some of the neighbourhood-level differences in COVID-19 across Ontario. Housing characteristics account for a portion, but not all, of the excess burden of COVID-19 experienced by immigrant, racialized, low income and low education populations.",Trevor van Ingen; Kevin A Brown; Sarah A Buchan; Samantha Akingbola; Nick Daneman; Brendan T Smith,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250618,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250618,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
500,Forecasting virus outbreaks with social media data via neural ordinary differential equations,"In the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, social media data collected in real time has the potential of being an early indicator of a new epidemic wave. This possibility is explored here by using a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) that is trained to predict virus outbreaks for a geographic region. It learns from multivariate time series of signals obtained from a novel set of massive online surveys about COVID-19 symptoms. Once trained, the neural ODE is able to capture the dynamics of the interlinked local signals and accurately predict the number of new infections up to two months in advance. Moreover, it can estimate the future effects of changes in the number of infected at a given time, which can be associated with the flow of people entering or leaving a given region or, for instance, with a local vaccination campaign.

Nevertheless, vaccine planning requires phased introduction with age groups, health workers, and vulnerable people. We developed a mathematical model capable of capturing the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 dissemination aligned with social distancing, isolation measures, and vaccination. The city of Rio de Janeiro provides a case study to analyze possible scenarios including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination in the epidemic scenario. Our results shows that a combination of different policies such as case isolation and social distancing are more effective for mitigating the epidemics. Furthermore, these policies will still be necessary in a phased vaccination program.

503,SARS-CoV-2 Seroepidemiology in Children and Adolescents,"ObjectivesPediatric SARS-CoV-2 data remain limited and seropositivity rates in children were reported as <1% early in the pandemic. Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the United States was performed.

MethodsChildren and adolescents [&le;]19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, United States. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens.

ResultsIn 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Orthogonal antibody testing with a receptor binding domain specific antigen revealed a high concordance of 80.5%. Children also demonstrated a robust immune response to the nucleocapsid antigen.

ConclusionsA much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported; this was also higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19 infection. The role of childrens disease transmission must be considered in COVID-19 mitigation strategies including vaccination.

Article Summary8.5% of children had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Fall 2020, double the adult rate. The role of pediatric infection is important to consider in mitigation strategies.

Whats Known on This SubjectSARS-CoV-2 pediatric seroepidemiologic data is limited. Reported viral rates underestimate the burden of infection in children due to mild or asymptomatic disease. Limited cohorts of children suggest low seropositivity rates compared to adults.

What This Study AddsUS children in the largest SARS-CoV-2 seroepidemiology study to date had double the rate of antibodies compared to adults. Most children were asymptomatic. Risk factors include age, ethnicity and living conditions. Most children made antibodies to different antigens of SARS-CoV-2.",Rebecca E Levorson; Erica Christian; Brett Hunter; Jasdeep Sayal; Jiayang Sun; Scott A Bruce; Stephanie Garofalo; Matthew Southerland; Svetlana Ho; Shira Levy; Christopher Defillipi; Lilian Peake; Frederick C Place; Suchitra K Hourigan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250466,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250466,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True
504,REACT-1 round 8 final report: high average prevalence with regional heterogeneity of trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in England during January 2021,"In early January 2021, England entered its third national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce numbers of deaths and pressure on healthcare services, while rapidly rolling out vaccination to healthcare workers and those most at risk of severe disease and death. REACT-1 is a survey of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the community in England, based on repeated cross-sectional samples of the population. Between 6th and 22nd January 2021, out of 167,642 results, 2,282 were positive giving a weighted national prevalence of infection of 1.57% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.66%). The R number nationally over this period was estimated at 0.98 (0.92, 1.04). Prevalence remained high throughout, but with suggestion of a decline at the end of the study period. The average national trend masked regional heterogeneity, with robustly decreasing prevalence in one region (South West) and increasing prevalence in another (East Midlands). Overall prevalence at regional level was highest in London at 2.83% (2.53%, 3.16%). Although prevalence nationally was highest in the low-risk 18 to 24 year old group at 2.44% (1.96%, 3.03%), it was also high in those over 65 years who are most at risk, at 0.93% (0.82%, 1.05%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with higher levels of infections compared to smaller households, less deprived neighbourhoods and other ethnicities. Healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, were more likely to test positive compared to other workers. If sustained lower prevalence is not achieved rapidly in England, pressure on healthcare services and numbers of COVID-19 deaths will remain unacceptably high.",Steven Riley; Oliver Eales; Caroline E.

505,Mapping a Pandemic: SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity in the United States,"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed implementation of diagnostics have led to poorly defined viral prevalence rates. To address this, we analyzed seropositivity in US adults who have not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Individuals with characteristics that reflect the US population (n = 11,382) and who had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 were selected by quota sampling from 241,424 volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04334954). Enrolled participants provided medical, geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic information and 9,028 blood samples. The majority (88.7%) of samples were collected between May 10th and July 31st, 2020. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies. Estimation of seroprevalence was performed by using a weighted analysis to reflect the US population. We detected an undiagnosed seropositivity rate of 4.6% (95% CI: 2.6 - 6.5%). There was distinct regional variability, with heightened seropositivity in locations of early outbreaks. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest estimated undiagnosed seropositivity within groups was detected in younger participants (ages 18-45, 5.9%), females (5.5%), Black/African American (14.2%), Hispanic (6.1%), and Urban residents (5.3%), and lower undiagnosed seropositivity in those with chronic diseases. During the first wave of infection over the spring/summer of 2020 an estimate of 4.6% of adults had a prior undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that there were 4.8 (95% CI: 2.8-6.8) undiagnosed cases for every diagnosed case of COVID-19 during this same time period in the United States, and an estimated 16.8 million undiagnosed cases by mid-July 2020.",Heather Kalish; Carleen Klumpp-Thomas; Sally Hunsberger; Holly Ann Baus; Michael P Fay; Nalyn Siripong; Jing Wang; Jennifer Hicks; Jennifer Mehalko; Jameson Travers; Matthew Drew; Kyle Pauly; Jacquelyn Spathies; Tran Ngo; Kenneth M Adusei; Maria Karkanitsa; Jennifer A Croker; Yan Li; Barry I Graubard; Lindsay Czajkowski; Olivia Belliveau; Cheryl Chairez; Kelly Snead; Peter Frank; Anandakumar Shunmugavel; Alison Han; Luca T Giurgea; Luz Angela Rosas; Rachel Bean; Rani Athota; Adriana Cervantes-Medina; Monica Gouzoulis; Brittany Heffelfinger; Shannon Valenti; Rocco Caldararo; Michelle M Kolberg; Andrew Kelly; Reid Simon; Saifullah Shafiq; Vanessa Wall; Susan Reed; Eric W Ford; Ravi Lokwani; John-Paul Denson; Simon Messing; Sam G Michael; William Gillette; Robert P Kimberly; Steven E Reis; Matthew D Hall; Dominic Esposito; Matthew J Memoli; Kaitlyn Sadtler,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250570,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250570,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,,True

507,Nationwide Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Saudi Arabia,"BackgroundEstimated seroprevalence of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a critical evidence for a better evaluation of the virus spread and monitoring the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in a population. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA total of 11703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates

ResultsOverall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95-10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension. The study also presents the demographics and prevalence of co-morbidities in HCWs and subset of non-COVID-19 population.

508,Evidence for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in the Urine of COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has so far affected over 42 million people worldwide, causing over 1.1 million deaths. With the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals being asymptomatic, major concerns have been raised about possible long-term consequences of the infection. We developed an antigen capture assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in urine samples from COVID-19 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs (NP-PCR+). The study used a collection of 233 urine samples from 132 participants from Yale New Haven Hospital and the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia obtained during the pandemic (106 NP-PCR+ and 26 NP-PCR-) as well as a collection of 20 urine samples from 20 individuals collected before the pandemic. Our analysis identified 23 out of 91 (25%) NP-PCR+ adult participants with SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein in urine (Ur-S+). Interestingly, although all NP-PCR+ children were Ur-S-, 1 NP-PCR-child was found to be positive for spike protein in urine. Of the 23 Ur-S+ adults, only 1 individual showed detectable viral RNA in urine. Our analysis further showed that 24% and 21% of NP-PCR+ adults have high levels of albumin and cystatin C in urine, respectively. Among individuals with albuminuria (>0.3 mg/mg of creatinine) statistical correlation could be found between albumin and spike protein in urine. Together, our data showe that 1 of 4 of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals develop renal abnormalities such as albuminuria.

509,Serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers of a tertiary care teaching institution in Central Kerala during the post lockdown phase,"BackgroundKerala was the first state to have the confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country and it was first confirmed in Thrissur district on 30 January2020.Our institute being in the heart of the city had to take adequate measures to mitigate the spread and treat the required patients by keeping its staff safe & Healthy. The hallmark of COVID 19 infection is high infectivity, pre-symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic prevalence which could result in high cumulative numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Kerala was the first state to confirm community transmission in July 2020.Health care workers being in the forefront in the war against COVID19 are very prone in acquiring the infection and are possible to be asymptomatic sources for cluster formation. Knowing the development of immunity as shown by the presence of anti COV2 antibodies in the population contributes to the epidemiological understanding of the disease. The intent of the study is to do an antibody testing in our hospital to find the serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers in our hospital.

AimTo estimate the seropositivity of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers at Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala, six months after revoking the lockdown

MethodologyA cross sectional study among the health care workers of the medical college. Multistage Sampling was done with the hospital block as the first stage and departments as the second stage. In the final stage of sampling the test individuals were selected on a first come first served basis after the antibody test availability was declared open and free for all staff. A consent form and a Google form were given to all staff who volunteered for participating in the study. Each consented participant recruited into the investigation completed a questionnaire which covers details regarding demographics, exposure history, Residence & travel. Blood sample was collected and Anti-SARS COV2 IgG antibody testing which targets the Spike Protein 1(SP1) was done using the VITROS chemiluminescence platform (Orthoclinical diagnostics, USA). Sampling & testing ranged over a time frame from September 5th to December 15th, 2020

ResultsJubilee Mission Medical College has 2785 working staff at the time of study. A total of 420 staff consented and their samples were tested. 37 staff members tested positive for COVID-19 antibody, yielding an overall prevalence of 8.75% (95% CI, 6.23-11.86). 86.5 % (32/37) of them were having a history of COVID-19 Antigen / RT PCR Positivity. We identified a statistically significant linear trend (p value =0.00001), between seropositivity and the degree of severity of COVID 19. Among the various factors which increase the risk of seroconversion, history of undergoing quarantine (p value < 0.001), contact with a confirmed case (p value = 0.002), contact with a caregiver for COVID 19 (p value =0.001) and history of Upper respiratory symptoms (p value =0.001), were found to be significantly associated with positive serology.

ConclusionsThe overall seropositivity in the current study was found to be 8.75% which is comparable to seroprevalence studies conducted in the United States and Wuhan in China. The pattern of seropositivity across the different category of health workers observed in the present study showed a higher prevalence among nurses. This result is also in agreement with a recent published report from united states. Various measures advised by the national and state health authorities were adequately adhered to. Keeping track of the pattern of development of immunity in the community is part of understanding the illness and forecasting the spread. For the tested HCW, it will boost up morale by ending uncertainty. For the hospital administration it will help in decision making about relative focusing of interventions on patients in general and HCWs. By knowing the immunity status of HCWs, the Institution will be able to contribute authentically to the development of intervention strategies and guidelines from time to time, besides following the available guidelines. Being an educational institution, it is obligatory to train all the elements of care delivery to the future generation of health care workers.
