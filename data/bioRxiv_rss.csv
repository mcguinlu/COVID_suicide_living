0,SARS-CoV-2 Elicits Robust Adaptive Immune Responses Regardless of Disease Severity,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently prevails worldwide. To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, >99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity. These data support the possibility of achieving protective immunity through natural infection and bode well for the prospects of inducing immunological memory through vaccination.",Stine Sofie Frank Nielsen; Line K Vibholm; Ida Monrad; Rikke Olesen; Giacomo S Frattari; Marie H Pahus; Jesper F Højen; Jesper D Gunst; Christian Erikstrup; Andreas Holleufer; Rune Hartmann; Lars Østergaard; Ole S Søgaard; Mariane H Schleimann; Martin Tolstrup,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.331645,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.331645,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
1,Remote home monitoring (virtual wards) during the COVID-19 pandemic: a living systematic review,"Objectives: The aim of this review was to analyse the implementation and impact of remote home monitoring models (virtual wards) during COVID-19, identifying their main components, processes of implementation, target patient populations, impact on outcomes, costs and lessons learnt. The review will be kept live through regular updates. Design: The review was designed as a living systematic review to capture a rapidly evolving evidence base. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Setting: The review included remote home monitoring models led by primary and secondary care across seven countries. Participants: 17 examples of remote home monitoring models were included in the review. Main outcome measures: Impact of remote home monitoring on virtual length of stay, escalation, Emergency department attendance, reattendance, admission, readmission and mortality. Results: The primary aim of the remote home monitoring models was the early identification of deterioration for patients self-managing COVID-19 symptoms at home. Most models were led by secondary care. Broad criteria for the eligible patient population were used and confirmation of COVID-19 was not required (in most cases). Monitoring was carried via online platforms, paper-based systems with telephone calls or (less frequently) through wearable sensors. We could not reach conclusions regarding patient safety and the identification of early deterioration due to lack of standardised reporting across articles and missing data. None of the articles reported any form of economic analysis, beyond how the resources were used. Conclusions: The review pointed to variability in the implementation of the models, in relation to healthcare sector, monitoring approach and selected outcome measures. Lack of standardisation on reporting prevented conclusions on the impact of remote home monitoring on patient safety or early escalation during COVID-19. Future research should focus on staff and patient experiences of care and potential inequalities in access to these models. Attention needs to be paid to the processes used to implement these models, the evaluation of their impact on patient outcomes through the use of comparators, the use of risk-stratification tools, and cost-effectiveness of the models and their sustainability. Protocol registration: The review protocol was published on PROSPERO (CRD: 42020202888).",Cecilia Vindrola-Padros; Kelly Singh; Manbinder S Sidhu; Theo Georghiou; Chris Sherlaw-Johnson; Sonila M Tomini; Matthew Inada-Kim; Karen Kirkham; Allison Streetly; Naomi J Fulop,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.331645,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208587,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
2,"Two-tiered SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion screening in the Netherlands and stability of nucleocapsid, spike protein domain 1 and neutralizing antibodies","Serological testing in the COVID-19 pandemic is mainly implemented to gain sero-epidemiological data, but can also retrospectively inform about suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n=7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n=97 LFA+ individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titers during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titers, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 days. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.",Anja Garritsen; Anja Scholzen; Daan WA van den Nieuwenhof; Anke PF Smits; Esther Suzan Datema; Luc S van Galen; Milou LCE Kouwijzer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208587,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20187641,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
3,Serological Analysis Reveals an Imbalanced IgG Subclass Composition Associated with COVID-19 Disease Severity,"COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity, and the levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, including virus neutralizing titers. Through a serological analysis of serum samples from 536 convalescent healthcare workers, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels were indeed elevated in individuals that experienced severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody was dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. However, RBD- and S1-specific IgG1, rather than IgG3 were best correlated with virus-neutralizing titers. We propose that Spike-specific IgG3 subclass utilization contributes to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, and convalescent plasma therapy.",Jennifer L. Yates; Dylan J. Ehrbar; Danielle T. Hunt; Roxie Girardin; Alan P.

4,Predictors of Death in Severe COVID-19 Patients at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia: A Case-Control Study,"Background: As the number of new cases and death due to COVID-19 is increasing, understanding the characteristics of severe COVID-19 patients and identifying characteristics that lead to death is a key to make an informed decision. In Ethiopia, as of September 27, 2020, a total of 72,700 cases and 1165 deaths were reported. Objective: The study aimed to assess the determinants of death in Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. Methods: A case-control study of 147 Severe COVID-19 patients (49 deaths and 98 discharged alive cases) was conducted from August to September 2020. A comparison of underlying characteristics between cases (death) and controls (alive) was assessed using a chi-square test and an independent t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the predictor variables and outcome of Severe COVID-19 (Alive Vs Death) where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. Results: Having diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348, 7.867, p-value=0.00), fever (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027) and Shortness of breath (AOR= 4.034, 95% CI= 1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in Severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: The outcome of death in Severe COVID-19 patients is found to be associated with exposures to being diabetic and having SOB at admission. On the other hand, having a fever at admission was associated with a favorable outcome of being discharged alive.",Endalkachew Hailu Maru; Tigist Workneh Leulseged; Ishmael Shemsedin Hassen; Wuletaw Chane Zewde; Nigat W/Hawariyat Chamesew; Daniel Simeneh Abebe; Tariku Bahiru Jagema; Abdi Bekele Bayisa; Mesfin Abebe Gezahegn; Oli Seyoum Tefera; Tekete Tilahun Admasu; Wondimagegn Genaneh Shiferaw,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20187641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20205575,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
5,Diagnostic comparison of three fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay platforms for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"The whole world is battling against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Various strategies are taken to curb the spread of the virus and to move out from the enforced lockdown stage. Serological tests are the neediest diagnostic and surveillance tool to complement the gold standard molecular diagnostic method to track down the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. Automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) based analyzers become highly demanding platforms both to clinicians and policy makers for the detection anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this study, serum from 594 patients positive for COVID-19 and 100 samples from pre-COVID cases were tested by three automated platforms: Abbott architect i2000SR, Roche cobas e411 and Yhlo iFlash 1800 and their diagnostic accuracy were compared. All three platforms showed high specificity as claimed by manufacturer. Clinical sensitivities of the machines were calculated as 64.48% (58.67-70.3) for Abbott, 80.48% (76.62-84.34) for Roche and 76.94% (72.65-81.23) for Yhlo. The Cohens kappa value was determined from 0.69-0.89 when inter-rater agreements were calculated. The area under the curves (AUC) values demonstrated Roche Cobas e411 as the diagnostically most accurate platform among the three CLIA analyzers.",Debaprasad Parai; Girish Chandra Dash; Hari Ram Choudhary; Annalisha Peter; Usha Kiran Rout; Rashmi Ranjan Nanda; Jaya Singh Kshatri; Srikanta Kanungo; Subrata Kumar Palo; Jyotirmayee Turuk; Sanghamitra Pati; Dr. Debdutta Bhattacharya,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20187641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207696,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
6,Psychiatric morbidity and protracted symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients,"We investigated the psychiatric symptomatology and the protracted symptoms in recently recovered COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study assessed 284 patients recruited from a tertiary hospital. Patients completed a web-based survey on socio-demographic data, past medical/psychiatric history, and additional information relevant to the outbreak conditions. The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Both the psychiatric morbidity and the protracted symptoms were independent of the initial infection severity. Further research on the neurobiological commonalities between the protracted symptoms and PTSD in COVID-19 patients is warranted.",Burc Cagri Poyraz; Cana Aksoy Poyraz; Yesim Olgun; Ozge Gurel; Sena Alkan; Yusuf Emre Ozdemir; Ilker Inanc Balkan; Ridvan Karaali,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208603,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208249,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
7,Detecting and isolating false negatives ofSARS-CoV-2 primers and probe sets among the Japanese Population: A laboratory testing methodology and study,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has spread across various continents in diverse methods and speed while opening up discussion for technological and scientific questions pertaining methodology of testing accuracy among diverse viral strains. On the issue of testing sensitivity and accuracy, RT-PCR is commonly viewed as a standard testing protocol globally as the predominant accurate testing method as opposed to other rapid testing methods. However, each country's infectious disease authority has established its own primers/probe sets guidelines and protocols, thereby, the global testing community lacks a ""Standardized Universal Primer(s)"" (SUP) that is foolproof for the COVID-19 patients among various populations today. As a result, RT-PCR testing accuracy and results may vary depending on which primer was used, most likely resulting in false negative and/or false positive calls associated with RT-PCR testing. In this study, a comparative study between primers from different countries' disease control centers was conducted. 11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for SARS-CoV-2 positive using recommended RT-PCR primers/probe sets from Japan National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results: Of the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent results when tested for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2. In addition, CDC recommended primer/probe sets showed relatively higher sensitivity and accuracy among the primer/probe sets used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive clones. Conclusion: Due to the inconsistency in the positive/negative results for JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer/probe sets, SARS-CoV-2 samples run via RT-PCR will result in false negative/positive subjected to differences in virus mutation in a specific sequence region targeted by a primer. This outcome shows that the use of JPN-N2 primer combined with CDC-N2 primer produces the most effective result to reduce false negatives in Japan region. Furthermore, adding CDC-N1 will result in reducing false negatives, but also false positives. Further investigation remains open for confirmation whether similar irregular pattern occur with primers targeting other regions such as E or ORF1ab in order to isolate false negatives and/or positives in future PCR testing for COVID-19.

8,Reliability and limits of transport-ventilators to safely ventilate severe patients in special surge situations.,"Background: Several Intensive Care Units (ICU) have been overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19 patients thus necessitating to extend ventilation capacity outside the ICU where air and oxygen pressure are not always available. Transport ventilators requiring only O2 source may be used to deliver volume-controlled ventilation. Objective: To evaluate the performances of four transport ventilators compared to an ICU ventilator simulating severe respiratory conditions. Materials and methods: Two pneumatic transport ventilators, (Oxylog 3000, Draeger; Osiris 3, Air Liquide Medical Systems) and two turbine transport ventilators (Elisee 350, ResMed; Monnal T60, Air Liquide Medical Systems) were compared to an ICU ventilator (Engstrom Carestation - GE Healthcare) using a Michigan training test lung. We tested each ventilator with different set volumes Vtset (350, 450, 550 ml) and different compliances (20 or 50 ml/cmH2O) and a resistance of 15 cmH20/L/sec based on values recently described in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Volume error was measured, as well as the trigger time delay during assist-control ventilation simulating spontaneous breathing activity with a P0.1 of 4 cmH20. Results: Grouping all conditions, the volume error was 2.9 +/- 2.2 % for Engstrom Carestation; 3.6 +/- 3.9 % for Osiris 3; 2.5 +/- 2.1 % for Oxylog 3000; 5.4 +/- 2.7 % for Monnal T60 and 8.8 +/- 4.8 % for Elisee 350. Grouping all conditions, trigger delay was 42 +/- 4 ms, 65 +/- 5 ms, 151 +/- 14 ms, 51 +/- 6 and 64 +/- 5 ms for Engstrom Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350, respectively. Conclusions: In special surge situations such as COVID-19 pandemic, most transport ventilators may be used to safely deliver volume-controlled ventilation in locations where only oxygen pressure supply is available with acceptable volume accuracy. Performances regarding triggering function are generally acceptable but vary across ventilators.",Dominique Savary; Arnaud Lesimple; Francois Beloncle; Francois Morin; Francois Templier; Alexandre Broc; Laurent Brochard; Jean-Christophe Richard; Alain Mercat,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20205575,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208561,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
9,Pulmonary Embolism in Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"Background: There is an increasing evidence that COVID-19 could be complicated by coagulopathy which may lead to death; especially in severe cases. Hence, this study aimed to build concrete evidence regarding the incidence and mortality of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic search for trusted databases/search engines including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library and web of science. After screening, the relevant data were extracted and the incidences and mortality rates from the different included studies were pooled for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty studies were finally included in our study consisting of 1896 patients. The results of the meta-analysis for the all included studies showed that the incidence of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 17.6% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 12.7 to 22.5%. There was significant heterogeneity. Additionally, the results of meta-analysis including 8 studies showed that the mortality in patients with both PE and COVID-19 was 43.1% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 19 to 67.1%. There was significant heterogeneity. Conclusion: PE was highly frequent in patients with COVID-19. The mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and PE was remarkable representing almost half of the patients.

10,Isolation of infected people and their contacts is likely to be effective against many short-term epidemics,"Background: Isolation of infected people and their contacts may be an effective way to control outbreaks of infectious disease, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Models can provide insights into the efficacy of contact tracing, coupled with isolating or quarantining at risk people. Methods: We developed an agent-based model and simulated 15, 000 short term illnesses, with varying characteristics. For each illness we ran ten simulations on the following scenarios: (1) No tracing or isolation (None), (2) isolation of agents who have tested positive (Isolation), (3) scenario 2 coupled with minimal contact tracing and quarantine of contacts (Minimum), (4) scenario 3 with more effective contact tracing (Moderate), and (5) perfect isolation of agents who test positive and perfect tracing and quarantine of all their contacts (Maximum). Results: The median total infections of the Isolation, Minimum, Moderate and Maximum scenarios were 80%, 40%, 17% and 4% of the no intervention scenario respectively. Conclusions: Isolation of infected patients and quarantine of their contacts, even if moderately well implemented, is likely to substantially reduce the number of infections in an outbreak. Randomized controlled trials to confirm these results in the real world and to analyse the cost effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation during coronavirus and influenza outbreaks are warranted.",Nathan Geffen; Marcus O Low,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207696,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207845,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
11,High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France,"Background A nationwide lockdown was implemented in France on 17 March 2020 to control the COVID-19 pandemic. People living in precarious conditions were relocated by the authorities to emergency shelters, hotels and large venues. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) then intervened to provide medical care in several of these locations in Paris and in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of its suburbs, between March and June 2020. A seroprevalence survey was conducted to assess the level of exposure to COVID-19 among the population living in the sites. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the impact of the pandemic on populations living in insecure conditions in Europe. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the food distribution sites, emergency shelters and workers residences supported by MSF in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, to determine the extent of COVID-19 exposure as determined by SARS-CoV2 antibody seropositivity. The detection of SARS-COV2 antibodies in serum was performed at the Institut Pasteur of Paris using two LuLISA (Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) assays and a Pseudo Neutralization Test. A questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, adherence to sanitary recommendations and symptom manifestations was also completed. We describe here the seroprevalence site by site and identify the risk factors for seropositivity using a multivariable logistic regression model with site random effects. We also investigated associations between seropositivity and symptoms eventually reported. Findings Overall, 426/818 individuals tested positive in the 14 sites investigated. Seroprevalence varied significantly with the type of site (chi2 p<0.001). It was highest at 88.7% (95%CI 81.8-93.2) among individuals living in workers residences, followed by 50.5% (95%CI 46.3-54.7) in emergency shelters and 27.8 % (95%CI 20.8-35.7) among individuals recruited from the food distribution sites. Seroprevalence also varied significantly between sites of the same type. Among other risk factors, the odds for seropositivity were higher among individuals living in crowded sites (medium: adj. OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.001; high: adj. OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.7-6.9, p<0.001) compared with individuals from low crowding sites and among those who reported transit accommodation in a gymnasium before the lockdown (adj. OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.2-8.1, p=0.023). More than two-thirds of the seropositive individuals (68.3%; 95%CI 64.2-72.2) did not report any symptoms during the recall period. Interpretation The results demonstrate rather high exposure to SARS-COV-2 with important variations between study sites. Living in crowded conditions was identified as the most important explanatory factor for differences in levels of exposure. This study describes the key factors which determine the risk of exposure and illustrates the importance of identifying populations at high risk of exposure in order to orient and adapt prevention and control strategies to their specific needs.",Thomas ROEDERER; Bastien MOLLO; Charline VINCENT; Birgit NIKOLAY; Augusto LLOSA; Robin NESBITT; Jessica VANHOMWEGEN; Thierry ROSE; Francois ANNA; Corinne TORRE; Emilie FOURREY; Sophie GOYARD; Yves JANIN; Pierre CHARNEAU; Oxana VRATSKIKH; Anneliese COURY; Stefan VANEL; Pierre MENDIHARAT; Klaudia PORTEN; William HENNEQUIN; Clair MILLS; Francisco LUQUERO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207696,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207795,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
12,AncestryDNA COVID-19 Host Genetic Study Identifies Three Novel Loci,"Human infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, leads to a remarkably diverse spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Recent reports suggest that both clinical and genetic risk factors may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To investigate genetic risk factors, we collected over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses between April and May 2020 with accompanying genetic data from the AncestryDNA database. We conducted sex-stratified and meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for COVID-19 susceptibility (positive nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) and severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). The severity GWAS replicated associations with severe COVID-19 near ABO and SLC6A20 (P<0.05). Furthermore, we identified three novel loci with P<5x10-8. The strongest association was near IVNS1ABP, a gene involved in influenza virus replication, and was associated only in males. The other two novel loci harbor genes with established roles in viral replication or immunity: SRRM1 and the immunoglobulin lambda locus. We thus present new evidence that host genetic variation likely contributes to COVID-19 outcomes and demonstrate the value of large-scale, self-reported data as a mechanism to rapidly address a health crisis.",Genevieve H.L.

13,Modelling testing and response strategies for COVID-19 outbreaks in remote Australian Aboriginal communities,"Background Remote Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have potential to be severely impacted by COVID-19, with multiple factors predisposing to increased transmission and disease severity. Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health responses. Methods An individual-based simulation model represented communities ranging from 100 to 3,500 people, comprised of large interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding, quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent introduction of a case. Results Multiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified. Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak infection prevalence from 60-70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission. Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than 10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80-90%, however, or epidemic control will be lost. Conclusions A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities. Prompt case detection with quarantining of extended-household contacts and a 14-day lockdown for all other residents, combined with exit testing for all, is the most effective strategy for rapid containment. Compliance is crucial, underscoring the need for community supported, culturally sensitive responses.",Ben B Hui; Damien Brown; Rebecca H Chisholm; Nicholas Geard; Jodie McVernon; David G Regan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208249,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208819,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
14,Report on COVID-19 Verification Case Study in Nine Countries Using the SIQR model,"This report uses the SIQR model proposed by Takashi Odagaki to examine the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in nine major countries during February-May 2020, and to clarify the peculiar trend of infection in Japan. The SIQR model, which is an improvement on the conventional SIR model, is unique in that it allows us to theoretically clarify the epidemic phenomenon by separating the number of daily confirmed new cases by testing and the number of infecteds at large who remain untested, and also allows us to theoretically consider measures to control the epidemic. The infection control measures of each country were analyzed by dividing them into three groups according to the size of the decay (or growth) rate of infected at large ({lambda}). The active group includes China and South Korea, the passive group includes the United States and Sweden, and the average group includes Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Japan. China and South Korea are the countries with the best testing and quarantine systems, and South Korea in particular having managed to contain the infection without lockdown through early quarantine by thorough testing. On the other hand, the United States and Sweden do not have a well-developed inspection and quarantine system and have shown little restraint in social distancing. In the case of Japan, the following special factors may have contributed to the extreme lack of PCR testing : (1) The ""4-day fever rule"" established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was strictly enforced. (2) Even after the decision to postpone the Olympics, the government continued to monopolize PCR testing for the sake of unified analysis of infection data, and the policy of expanding PCR testing by private companies was not implemented.",suda reiji,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208264,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208298,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
15,Cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes: a living systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE To continually evaluate the rapidly evolving evidence base on the role of cardiovascular drugs in COVID-19 clinical outcomes (susceptibility to infection, hospitalization, hospitalization length, disease severity, and all-cause mortality). DESIGN Living systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Eligible publications identified from >500 databases indexed through 31st July 2020 and additional studies from reference lists, with planned continual surveillance for at least two years. STUDY SELECTION Observational and interventional studies that report on the association between cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION Single-reviewer extraction and quality evaluation (using ROBINS-I), with half the records independently extracted and evaluated by a second reviewer. RESULTS Of 23,427 titles screened, 175 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The most reported drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACEI/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30). Among patients with COVID-19, unadjusted estimates showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with being hospitalized (OR 2.25, 1.70 to 2.98) and having severe disease (OR 1.50, 1.27 to 1.77) but not with the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.45, -1.33 to 0.43 days) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.25, CI 0.98 to 1.58). However, after adjustment, ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled adjusted OR 1.01, 0.93 to 1.10), being hospitalized (OR 1.16, 0.80 to 1.68), having severe disease (1.04, 0.76 to 1.42), or all-cause mortality (0.86, 0.64 to 1.15). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with being hospitalized (OR 0.84, 0.58 to 1.22), disease severity (OR 0.88, 0.68 to 1.14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.77, 0.54 to 1.12) while it decreased the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.71, -1.11 to -0.30 days). After adjusting for relevant covariates, other cardiovascular drug classes were mostly not found to be associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high level of heterogeneity in terms of effect sizes and a serious risk of bias, mainly due to confounding in the included studies. CONCLUSION Our comprehensive review shows that ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with COVID-19 outcomes such as susceptibility to infection, severity, and hospitalization in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, this association is not evident. Patients on cardiovascular drugs should continue taking their medications as currently recommended. Higher quality evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine any adverse or beneficial effects of cardiovascular drugs.

16,Role of high-dose exposure in transmission hot zones as a driver of SARS-CoV2 dynamics,"Epidemiological data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of various non-pharmaceutical interventions indicate that the virus is not transmitted uniformly in the population. Transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons, or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transmission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so called transmission hot zones, characterized by high dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. Interestingly, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high-dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. This gives rise to the prediction that targeted interventions that specifically reduce virus transmission in the hot zones (but not in the community at large) have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. The model can further reconcile seemingly contradicting epidemiological observations. While in some locations like California, strict stay-home orders failed to significantly reduce infection prevalence, in other locations, such as New York and several European countries, stay-home orders lead to a pronounced fall in infection levels, which remained suppressed for some months after re-opening of society. Differences in hot zone transmission levels during and after social distancing interventions can account for these diverging infection patterns. These modeling results warrant further epidemiological investigations into the role of high dose hot zone transmission for the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 spread.",Dominik Wodarz; Natalia L.

17,EFFECT OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA ON MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA,"Abstract Background Convalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing antibodies, has been proposed for COVID-19, and preliminary evidence shows that it might have beneficial effect. Our objective was to compare epidemiological characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. Methods This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. Results We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62{+/-}17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor. Conclusions Our study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the hospital might be associated with decreased mortality.",Martin R Salazar; Soledad E Gonzalez; Lorena Regairaz; Noelia S Ferrando; Veronica Gonzalez; Patricia M Carrera; Laura Muñoz; Santiago A Pesci; Juan M Vidal; Nicolas Kreplak; Elisa Estenssoro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208561,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20202606,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
18,"COVID-19, Type-2 Diabetes, and Associated Health Outcomes in China: Results from a Nationwide Survey of 10,545 Adults","Objective: This study examined the associations between type-2 diabetes (T2DM) and self-reported/familial COVID-19 infection and investigated health-related outcomes among those with diabetes during China's nationwide quarantine. Research Design and Methods: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat) across China. It was completed by 10,545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables, adjusting for covariates. Results: Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among patients with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with T2DM tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting T2DM and 8.0% without T2DM). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with T2DM experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without T2DM (22.7 % and 25.8%, respectively). Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Conclusions: T2DM was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.",Zumin Shi; Alice Yan; Paul Zimmet; Xiaoming Sun; Nayla Cristina do Vale Moreira; Lawrence J Cheskin; Liming Wang; Weidong Qu; Hong Yan; Akhtar Hussain; Youfa Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209965,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207282,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
19,A high-throughput microfluidic nano-immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or ultra-low volume dried blood samples,"Novel technologies are needed to facilitate large-scale detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human blood samples. Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 L whole blood easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.",Zoe Swank; Grégoire Michielin; Hon Ming Yip; Patrick Cohen; Diego O.

20,Major role of IgM in the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2,"Characterization of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of Covid-19, is essential to help control the infection. In this regard, we and others recently reported that the neutralization activity of plasma from COVID-19 patients decreases rapidly during the first weeks after recovery. However, the specific role of each immunoglobulin isotype in the overall neutralizing capacity is still not well understood. In this study, we selected plasma from a cohort of Covid-19 convalescent patients and selectively depleted immunoglobulin A, M or G before testing the remaining neutralizing capacity of the depleted plasma. We found that depletion of immunoglobulin M was associated with the most substantial loss of virus neutralization, followed by immunoglobulin G. This observation may help design efficient antibody-based COVID-19 therapies and may also explain the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of autoimmune patients receiving therapies that impair the production of IgM.",Romain Gasser; Marc Cloutier; Jeremie Prevost; Corby Fink; Eric Ducas; Shilei Ding; Nathalie Dussault; Patricia Landry; Tony Tremblay; Audrey Laforce-Lavoie; Antoine Lewin; Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres; Annemarie Laumaea; Halima Medjahed; Catherine Larochelle; Jonathan Richard; Gregory A Dekaban; Jimmy D Dikeakos; Renee Bazin; Andres Finzi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207845,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333278,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
21,Variant analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Middle East,"Background: Coronavirus (COVID-19) was introduced into society in late 2019 and has now reached over 26 million cases and 850,000 deaths. The Middle East has a death toll of ~50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over 350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19. Methods: The approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Findings: We identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East. Interpretation: The phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants affecting in the region than any other study.",Khalid M Bindayna; Shane Crinion,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207845,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332692,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
22,Batch-Corrected Distance Mitigates Temporal and Spatial Variability for Clustering and Visualization of Single-Cell Gene Expression Data,"Clustering and visualization are essential parts of single-cell gene expression data analysis. The Euclidean distance used in most distance-based methods is not optimal. Batch effect, i.e., the variability among samples gathered from different times, tissues, and patients, introduces large between-group distance and obscures the true identities of cells. To solve this problem, we introduce Batch-Corrected Distance (BCD), a metric using temporal/spatial locality of the batch effect to control for such factors. We validate BCD on a simulated data as well as applied it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset. We also found the utility of our approach in understanding the progression of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). BCD achieves more accurate clusters and better visualizations than state-of-the-art batch correction methods on longitudinal datasets. BCD can be directly integrated with most clustering and visualization methods to enable more scientific findings.",Shaoheng Liang; Jinzhuang Dou; Ramiz Iqbal; Ken Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207795,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.332080,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False

With an increased infection and transmission rate, it is imperative to determine whether antibodies induced against the D614 isolate may cross-neutralize against the G614 variant. In this report, profiling of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity reveals similar neutralization profiles against both S protein variants, albeit waning neutralizing antibody capacity at the later phase of infection.

The spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the three sub-domains viz. amino acids (aa) 22-42, aa 79-84, and aa 330-393 of ACE2 on human cells to initiate entry. It was reported earlier that the receptor utilization capacity of ACE2 proteins from different species, such as cats, chimpanzees, dogs, and cattle, are different. A comprehensive analysis of ACE2 receptors of nineteen species was carried out in this study, and the findings propose a possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission flow across these nineteen species.",Sk.

26,Age- and Sex-Specific Modelling of the COVID-19 Epidemic,"Background: Recent research points towards age- and sex-specific transmission of COVID-19 infections and their outcomes. The effect of sex, however, has been overlooked in past modelling approaches of COVID-19 infections. Aim: The aim of our study is to develop an age- and sex-specific model of COVID-19 transmission and to explore how contact changes effect COVID-19 infection and death rates. Method: We consider a compartment model to establish forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the compartments are subdivided into different age groups and genders. Estimated contact patterns, based on other studies, are incorporated to account for age- and sex-specific social behaviour. The model is fitted to real data and used for assessing hypothetical scenarios with regard to lockdown measures. Results: Under current mitigation measures as of mid-August, active COVID-19 cases will double by the end of October 2020. Infection rates will be highest among the young and working ages, but will also rise among the old. Sex ratios reveal higher infection risks among women than men at working ages; the opposite holds true at old age. Death rates in all age groups are twice as high among men as women. Small changes in contact rates at working and young ages may have a considerable effect on infections and mortality at old age, with elderly men being always at higher risk of infection and mortality. Discussion: Our results underline the high importance of the non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures in the current phase of the pandemic to prevent that an increase in contact rates leads to higher mortality among the elderly. Gender differences in contact rates, in addition to biological mechanisms related to the immune system, may contribute to sex-specific infection rates and their mortality outcome.

27,Personal protective equipment for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers involved in emergency trauma surgery during the pandemic: a systematic review protocol,"Objective: The objective of this broad evidence synthesis is to identify and summarize the available literature regarding the efficacy of different personal protective equipment (PPE) for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery in low-resource environments (LREs). Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced and may lack optimal organization and governance, especially concerning surgical health systems. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for the patients. Inclusion criteria: This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in emergency trauma surgery. Methods: We will conduct several searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Critical appraisal of the eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardized data extraction tool in Covidence.

28,System Dynamics Model of Possible Covid-19 Trajectories Under Various Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Options in Low Resource Setting.,"We present a population-based System Dynamics Model (SDM) of possible Covid-19 trajectories under various intervention options in the uniqueness of Kenya. We developed a stock and flow based SDM. We parametrized the SDM using published data and where data was not available, expert opinion was sought. Following validation test, the model was simulated to determined possible outcomes of non-pharmaceutical interventions in management of Covid-19. We simulate the possible impact of; social distancing, quarantining, curfew and cross-county travel restriction, lockdown of selected cities in Kenya and quarantining. We varied interventions in terms of start dates, duration of implementation and effectiveness of the interventions. We estimated the outcomes in terms of number of possible infections, recoveries and deaths. With the current state of interventions, we estimated a peak of Covid-19 in September 2020 with an estimated 13.5 Million Covid-19 cases and 33.8 thousand deaths in Kenya. The largest possible reduction in infections and mortality was achievable through increase in the effectiveness of the interventions. The suggested interventions would delay the epidemic peak of Covid-19 to between late Nov 2020 and early December 2020 with an estimated13M cases a 500 thousand reduction in Covid-19 cases and 32.4 deaths( a reduction in 1400 deaths).

Methods: this prospective, observational, single-centre study included outpatients reviewed 12 weeks after an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation included data about the acute episode and epidemiological and clinical variables. The patients were classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the persistence or otherwise of symptoms. All the patients underwent a full blood test and serology for SARS-CoV-2, as well as imaging tests and spirometry if needed. Results: The mean age of the 108 patients was 55.5 (SD: 15.4) years and 27.8% were health-care workers; 75.9% presented some type of symptoms, with dyspnoea being the most common. A D-dimer >500 ng/mL was detected in 32 (31.4%) patients. All the patients had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Being a health-care worker was associated with symptom persistence, with age [&ge;]65 years being a protective factor.

30,"Clinical, laboratory, and temporal predictors of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19","Background: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may protect from reinfection and disease, providing the rationale for administration of plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a treatment for COVID-19. The clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood. Methods: Adults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb. Results: Amongst 250 consecutive persons studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers [&ge;]1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses. Conclusions: Nab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing.

31,"Real-World Effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin among hospitalized COVID-19 patients: Results of a target trial emulation using observational data from a nationwide Healthcare System in Peru","Introduction: In Latin America, Peru is the most impacted country due to COVID-19 pandemic. Given the authorized nationwide use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin and dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients, we aimed to evaluate their effectiveness alone or combined to prevent 30-day mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients without life-threatening illness. Methods: Design. Retrospective cohort study using digital clinical records to emulate a target trial. Setting. Nationwide data of mid- and high-level complexity hospitals from the Peruvian Social Health Insurance (EsSalud) between April 1 and July 19, 2020. Participants. Patients aged 18 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, and non-severe pneumonia at admission. Interventions. We compared five treatment groups to the standard of care treatment regimen (control group) within 48 hours of admission to hospital: hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone (HCQ), ivermectin alone (IVM), azithromycin alone (AZIT), HCQ + AZIT group, and IVM + AZIT group with doses recommended by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Main outcomes measures. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate, the secondary outcomes were survival without ICU rate, and survival without oxygen prescription rate. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. A doubly-adjustment method was done for sensitivity analysis. Results: Among 5683 patients eligible for analysis, 200 received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine within 48 hours of hospital admission, 203 received ivermectin, 1600 received azithromycin, 692 received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine plus azithromycin, 358 received ivermectin plus azithromycin and 2630 received standard of care. AZIT + HCQ group was associated with 84% higher all-cause mortality hazard rate compared to standard care (wHR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.12-3.02). Consistently, AZIT + HCQ treatment was associated with survival without transfer to ICU (wHR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.01-2.19) and survival without oxygen prescription (wHR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.07-2.69). HCQ treatment was associated with 77% higher all-cause mortality or oxygen prescription hazard rate compared to standard treatment (wHR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.01-3.11). Surprisingly, we observed that IVM treatment was associated with less survival rate without transfer to ICU in the weighted analysis (wHR = 1.58, 95% CI:1.11-2.25) By last, we did not find evidence of effect on reduce all-cause mortality or increase survival rate without transfer to ICU or survival rate without oxygen prescription for AZIT group neither AZIT + IVM group in all analyses.

32,Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the sole causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. Results: A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c < 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein > 88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia < 1000 cells/ml (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission. Conclusion: Hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors.

33,Comparison of efficacy of Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone in improving P/F ratio among COVID-19 patients,"Abstract Introduction The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), created a pandemic in late 2019. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients. Methods We selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2 patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants. Results The initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg/L after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg/L, which decreased to 43.82 mg/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P/F ratio (p<0.05), and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p<0.05). Conclusion Steroids have ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients. Physicians should consider the use of dexamethasone use in appropriate patients with COVID-19.

34,Suicide and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis, but its effect on suicide deaths is little understood. Method: We analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and August 2020 and online surveys on mental health among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Results: Compared to the last three years (2017-2019), the number of suicide deaths was lower during the initial phase of the pandemic but subsequently exceeded the past trend. By August 2020, the total number of suicides was 5.69% higher than the average number of suicides in the same month of the previous three years. The largest increase was found in suicides by young women (less than 40 years of age), with a 40% increase in August 2020 compared to the same month in the past three years. The number of suicides among students and housekeepers in summer months was notably larger in 2020. The survey data indicated that the status of mental health among young women was worse than that of women in other age groups. In addition, young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss in recent months compared to any other groups, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding some of these young female workers. Conclusion: Our results strongly indicate that continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Michiko Ueda; Robert Nordström; Tetsuya Matsubayashi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207092,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207530,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True

36,Plasma ACE2 activity is persistently elevated following SARS-CoV-2 infection: implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis and consequences,"COVID-19 causes persistent endothelial inflammation, lung and cardiovascular complications. SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We reported downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma ACE2 activity. In this prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes and increased plasma ACE2 activity. Methods We measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay in a cohort of Australians aged 18 years and over who had recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR testing) (n=66) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples were available in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. Results Plasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days] was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in plasma ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive had higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (p<0.0001). We next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection. Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects, with no significant differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p>0.05). Discussion This is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after COVID-19 infection, and the first with longitudinal data indicating plasma ACE2 activity remains elevated out to a median of 114 days post- infection. Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistent elevated plasma ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19.",Sheila K Patel; Jennifer A Juno; P Mark Hogarth; Wen Shi Lee; Stephen J Kent; Louise M Burrell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20171579,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207514,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True
37,Mask mandates can limit COVID spread: Quantitative assessment of month-over-month effectiveness of governmental policies in reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases in 37 US States and the District of Columbia,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is the beta-coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Facemask use has been qualitatively associated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but no study has quantitatively assessed the impact of government mask mandates (MM) on new COVID-19 cases across multiple US States. Data and Methods: We utilized a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm to test the a priori hypothesis that MM were associated with reductions in new COVID-19 cases. Publicly available data were used to analyze new COVID-19 cases from 37 States and the District of Columbia (i.e., ""38 States""). We conducted confirmatory All-States and State-Wise analyses, validity analyses [e.g., leave-one-out (LOO) and bootstrap resampling], and covariate analyses. Results: No statistically significant difference in the daily number of new COVID-19 infections was discernible in the All-States analysis. In State-Wise LOO validity analysis, 11 States exhibited reductions in new COVID-19 and the reductions in four of these States (AK, MA, MN, VA) were significant in bootstrap resampling. Only the Social Capital Index predicted MM success (training p<0.028 and LOO p<0.013). Conclusion: Results obtained when studying the impact of MM on COVID-19 cases varies as a function of the heterogeneity of the sample being considered, providing clear evidence of Simpson's Paradox and thus of confounded findings. As such, studies of MM effectiveness should be conducted on disaggregated data. Since transmissions occur at the individual rather than at the collective level, additional work is needed to identify optimal social, psychological, environmental, and educational factors which will reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate MM effectiveness across diverse settings.",Michael J Maloney; Nathaniel James Rhodes; Paul R Yarnold,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20171579,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208033,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True

This contribution aims to use tools of time series analysis for understanding processes of contagious through regions. I use VAR and Granger causality for testing neighbor spreading via sequential rate of contagion. Results show that in the case of Argentina, contagion began in the capital city of Buenos Aires and then spread to its hinterland via specific districts. Once interior districts were infected a positive feedback dynamics emerge creating regions of high reproducibility of the virus where interventions may be focus in the very near future. This specific use of time series analysis may provide a tool for tracing infectiousness along regions that may help to anticipate infection and then for intervening for reducing the problems derived by the disease.",Juan M.C.

39,Misinterpretation of viral load in COVID-19.,"Knowledge of viral load is essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. Moreover, patients identification with high viral load could also be useful to understand risk factors such as age, comorbidities, severity of symptoms and hypoxia to decide the need for hospitalization. Several studies are evaluating the importance of analyzing viral load in different types of samples, clinical outcomes and viral transmission pathways. However, in a great number of emerging studies cycle threshold (Ct) values by itself is often used as a viral load indicator, which may be a mistake. In this study, we compared tracheal aspirate with nasopharyngeal samples obtained from critically ill COVID-19 patients and demonstrate how the raw Ct could lead to misinterpretation of results. Further, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs positive samples and propose a method to reduce evaluation error that could occur from using raw Ct. Based on these findings, we show the impact that normalization of Ct values has on interpretation of viral load data from different biological samples from patients with COVID-19, transmission and lastly in relations with clinical outcomes.",Renan Lyra Miranda; Alexandro Guterres; Carlos Henrique de Azeredo Lima; Paulo Niemeyer Filho; Mônica Roberto Gadelha,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207530,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208009,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True

A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional sample of 30 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis, humoral and inflammatory responses. 132 distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitope responses across six different HLAs were detected, corresponding to 52 unique reactivities. T cell responses were directed against several structural and non-structural virus proteins. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response. Overall, T cells exhibited distinct differentiation into stem-cell and transitional memory states, subsets, which may be key to developing durable protection.",Hassen Kared; Andrew D Redd; Evan M Bloch; Tania S.

41,Preferential recognition and antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binding to 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is in immediate need of an effective antidote. Although the Spike glycoprotein (SgP) of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to heparins, the structural features of this interaction, the role of a plausible heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptor, and the antagonism of this pathway through small molecules remain unaddressed. Using an in vitro cellular assay, we demonstrate HSPGs modified by the 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform-3, but not isoform-5, preferentially increased SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in comparison to control, unmodified, wild-type HSPGs. Computational studies support preferential recognition of the receptor-binding domain of SgP by 3-O-sulfated HS sequences. Competition with either fondaparinux, a 3-O-sulfated HS-binding oligopeptide, or a synthetic, non-sugar small molecule, blocked SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Finally, the synthetic, sulfated molecule inhibited fusion of GFP-tagged pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with human 293T cells with sub-micromolar potency. Overall, overexpression of 3-O-sulfated HSPGs contribute to fusion of SARS-CoV-2, which could be effectively antagonized by a synthetic, small molecule.",Vaibhav Tiwari; Ritesh Tandon; Nehru Viji Sankaranarayanan; Jacob C Beer; Ellen K Kohlmeir; Michelle Swanson-Mungerson; Umesh R.

42,Genome-scale identification of SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus host factor networks,"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than one million people worldwide. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which are viruses that cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses. This human Coronaviridae host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus spillover events.

43,Developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on probe mix and amplitude based multiplexing,"Multiplexing has been highlighted to save on costs, increase sample throughput, and maximize on the number of targets that can be sensitively detected within a small sample. With the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, different articles have been published highlighting the superiority of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) over the gold reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. In this study, we developed simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and fourplex (4 targets) assays based on a two color ddPCR system for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results showed that the fourplex assay had the similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical isolates demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug couldn't.

One of the primary benefits of face masks and other coverings is as source control devices to reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols during coughing, breathing, and speaking. Face shields have been proposed as an alternative to face masks, but information about face shields as source control devices is limited. We used a cough aerosol simulator with a headform to propel small aerosol particles (0 to 7 m) into different face coverings. An N95 respirator blocked 99% of the cough aerosol, a procedure mask blocked 59%, a 3-ply cloth face mask blocked 51%, and a polyester neck gaiter blocked 47% as a single layer and 60% when folded into a double layer.

45,Contact tracing and isolation reduces Covid-19 incidence in a structured agent-based model,"Background: The World Health Organization has identified contact tracing and isolation (CTI) as a key strategy to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Structured agent-based models (ABMs) provide a means to investigate the efficacy of such strategies in heterogeneous populations and to explore the impact of factors such as changes in test turnaround times (TaT). Methods: We developed a structured ABM to simulate key SARS-CoV-2 transmission and Covid-19 disease progression dynamics in populations of 10,000 agents. We ran 10,000 simulations of each of three scenarios: (1) No CTI with a TaT of two days, (2) CTI with a TaT of two days, and (3) CTI with a TaT of eight days. We conducted a secondary analysis in which TaT values were varied from two to 11. The primary outcome for all analyses was mean total infections. Results: CTI reduced the mean number of infections from 5,577 to 4,157 (a relative reduction of 25.5%) when TaT was held steady at two days. CTI with a TaT of eight days resulted in a mean of 5,163 infections (a relative reduction of 7.4% compared to no CTI and a TaT of two days). In the secondary analysis, every additional day added to the TaT increased the total number of infections - with the greatest increase in infections between four and five days, and the smallest increase between ten and eleven days. Conclusions: In a structured ABM that simulates key dynamics of Covid-19 transmission and disease progression, CTI results in a substantial reduction in the mean number of total infections. The benefit is greater with shorter TaT times, but remained substantial even with TaTs of eight days. The results suggest that CTI may play a critical role in reducing the size of outbreaks and that TaTs should be kept as short as possible in order to maximise this benefit.",Marcus O Low; Nathan Geffen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208033,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207761,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
46,Tracking the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in coastal Kenya,"We generated 274 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples collected during the early phase of the Kenyan pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis identified 8 global lineages and at least 76 independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Kenyan coast. The dominant B.1 lineage (European origin) accounted for 82.1% of the cases. Lineages A, B and B.4 were detected from screened individuals at the Kenya-Tanzania border or returning travellers but did not lead to established transmission. Though multiple lineages were introduced in coastal Kenya within three months following the initial confirmed case, none showed extensive local expansion other than cases characterised by lineage B.1, which accounted for 45 of the 76 introductions. We conclude that the international points of entry were important conduits of SARS-CoV-2 importations. We speculate that early public health responses prevented many introductions leading to established transmission, but nevertheless a few undetected introductions were sufficient to give rise to an established epidemic.",George Githinji; Zaydah R deLaurent; Khadija Said Mohamed; Donwilliams O Omuoyo; Peter M Macharia; John M Morobe; Edward Otieno; Samson M Kinyanjui; Ambrose Agweyu; Eric Maitha; Ben Kitole; Thani Suleiman; Mohamed Mwakinangu; John Nyambu; John Otieno; Barke Salim; Kadondi Kasera; John Kiiru; Rashid Aman; Edwine Barasa; George Warimwe; Philip Bejon; Benjamin Tsofa; Lynette Isabella Ochola-Oyier; D James Nokes; Charles N Agoti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207993,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206730,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
47,Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to lead to a significant increase in mental health disorders amongst healthcare workers (HCW). Aims We evaluated the prevalence of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a HCW population in the United Kingdom (UK), to identify subgroups most at risk. Methods An electronic survey was conducted between the 05/06/2020 and 31/07/2020 of all hospital HCW in the West Midlands, UK using clinically validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations. Results There were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female: 79.5%, median age: 42 [IQR: 32-51] years). The prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were 34.3%, 31.2% and 24.5% respectively. In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.9-2.7]; p<0.001), depression (2.5 [2.1-3.0]; p<0.001) and PTSD (2.1 [1.7-2.5]; p<0.001). The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), wellbeing support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with former symptoms (p[&le;]0.001). Conclusions We report a high prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD in hospital HCW following the initial Covid-19 pandemic peak in the UK. Those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk. Adequate PPE availability, access to wellbeing support and reduced exposure to moral dilemmas may protect hospital HCW from mental health symptoms.",Kasun Wanigasooriya; Priyanka Palimar; David Naumann; Khalida Ismail; Jodie L.

48,Psychiatric side effects induced by chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: a systematic review of case reports and population studies,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are commonly used drugs in the treatment of malaria as well as chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although various reports on possible psychiatric side effects of these drugs exist, the nature and extent of these effects remain poorly understood. Moreover, the relevance of these drugs in the treatment of early stages of COVID-19 necessitates a careful estimation of their side effects. Here, we provide a systematic review of the psychiatric side effects associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to identify relevant literature published between 1962 and 2020. Search terms included chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, psychiatry, psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, delirium, and psychotic disorders. Only case reports and clinical trials were included. All studies included records of psychiatric side effects induced by either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or both. Both retrospective and prospective, randomized as well as non-randomized population studies were included. Overall, the psychiatric side effects are dose- and sex-independent. The most common psychiatric side effects reported are increased speech output/ excessive talking, increased psychomotor activity, irritable mood, auditory hallucinations, delusion of grandiosity, and suicide attempts, likely due to brain intoxicationbe of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The symptoms can develop in a few hours to 11 weeks after drug intake and are normally reversed within a week after the drug withdrawal. We conclude that CQ and HCQ have the potential to induce psychiatric side effects. This study calls for further investigation of psychiatric symptoms induced by these drugs in the short and long term.",Fernanda Talarico; Sucheta Chakravarty; Yang Liu; Angrew Greenshaw; Ives Passos; Bo Cao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208009,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207423,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
49,A potential impact of physical distancing on physical and mental health. A rapid narrative umbrella review of meta-analyses on the link between social isolation and health,"Background: The imperative for physical distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may deteriorate physical and mental health. We aimed at summarizing the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of social isolation and loneliness with physical and mental health. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone, and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social isolation and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarized in a narrative synthesis. Results: Twenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. A total of more than 3 million individuals had participated in the 692 primary studies. The results suggest that social isolation is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The existing evidence clearly indicates that social isolation is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.",Nexhmedin Morina; Ahlke Kip; Thole H Hoppen; Stefan Priebe; Thomas Meyer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208009,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207571,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
50,Business Shutdowns and COVID-19 Mortality,"Governments around the world have adopted unprecedented policies to deal with COVID-19. This paper zooms in on business shutdowns and investigates their effectiveness in reducing mortality. We leverage upon highly granular death registry data for over 4,000 Italian municipalities in a diff-in-diff approach that allows us to credibly mitigate endogeneity concerns. Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that business shutdowns are very effective in reducing mortality. We calculate that the death toll from the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy would have been twice as high in their absence. Our findings also highlight that timeliness is key: by acting one week earlier, the government could have reduced the death toll by an additional 25%. Finally, our estimates suggest that shutdowns should be targeted: closing shops, bars and restaurants saves the most lives, while shutting down manufacturing and construction activities has only mild effects.",Gabriele Ciminelli; Silvia Garcia-Mandico,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.330688,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207910,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
51,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using pooling of self-collected samples: Simple protocols may foster asymptomatic surveillance,"Background: Surveillance of COVID infection and isolation of infected individuals is one of the available tools to control the spread of SAR-CoV-2. Asymptomatic and pre symptomatic are responsible for substantial transmission. RNA or antigen tests are necessary to identify non-symptomatic individuals. We tested the feasibility of using samples pooling offering different collection alternatives (swab/throat wash/saliva) to volunteers of a public health institute. Methods: We evaluated pool samples from both reconstituted (frozen material from tested samples) and a prospective collection of asymptomatic volunteers. Some collections were paired for comparison. Pooled and some individual samples were extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and/or Lucigen Quick Extract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch, USA) and submitted to rtCCR using (Allplex, Seegene, Korea). Results: A total of 240 samples from 130 new collections and 37 samples with known result were evaluated. Pool CT was generally higher than individual samples. Lucigen extraction showed higher CT, including false negative results for samples with high CT at Qiagen extraction. Paired Swab and TW samples showed comparable results. No volunteer from negative pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after collection. Conclusions: Clinical samples pooling to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is feasible and an economical way to test for COVID-19, especially in surveillance strategies targeting more infectiousness, higher viremia individuals. The use of Lucigen reagents show lower sensibility that may lead to false negative results with lower viremia samples.

52,"Antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in adults from the Vancouver metropolitan area, Canada","Background: Quantifying antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens may help understand its effect on COVID-19 severity at the population level. This antibody reactivity may be particularly prevalent among childcare providers, including pediatric health care workers (HCW) who may be more exposed to circulating coronaviruses. Methods: Cross-sectional study that included adults in the Vancouver area in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between May 17 and June 19, 2020. A novel 10-plex antibody assay (IgG) was used to measure antibody reactivity against the spike protein from circulating coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), SARS-CoV, and four SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Seroreactivity from previous viral exposure was ascertained using this assay, and by measuring total SARS-CoV-2 IgG/M/A antibodies against a recombinant spike (S1) protein using a commercial CLIA assay. Findings: Among 276 participants (71% HCW), three showed evidence of direct viral exposure, yielding an adjusted seroprevalence of 0.6% [95%CI 0.2 to 3.1%], with no difference between HCW and non-HCW, or between paediatric and adult HCW. Among the remaining 273 unexposed individuals, 7.3% [95%CI 4.5% to 11.1%], 48.7 [95%CI 42.7% to 54.8%] and 82.4% [95%CI 77.4% to 86.7%] showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, N or Spike proteins, respectively. This reactivity was evenly distributed as a function of age, sex or between paediatric and adult HCW, and partly correlated with reactivity to circulating coronaviruses (Spearman; range: 0.147 to 0.513 for significant correlation after false-discovery rate adjustment at 5%). Interpretation: A substantial proportion of individuals in this population showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens despite low serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.",Abdelilah Majdoubi; Sarah E O'Connell; Christina Michalski; Sarah Dada; Sandeep Narpala; Jean Gelinas; Disha Mehta; Claire Cheung; Manjula Basappa; Matthias Gorges; Vilte E Barakauskas; David M Goldfarb; Daniel C Douek; Adrian B McDermott; Pascal M Lavoie,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.331751,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206664,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
53,The potential impact of intervention strategies on COVID-19 transmission in Malawi: A mathematical modelling study,"Background COVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings such as Malawi due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we estimate the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity. Methods The infection fatality ratios (IFR) in Malawi were estimated by adjusting reported IFR for China accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions. The impact of a novel therapeutic agent and increases in hospital capacity and oxygen availability were explored, given different assumptions on mortality rates. Findings The estimated age-specific IFR in Malawi are higher than those reported for China, however the younger average age of the population results in a slightly lower population-weighted IFR (0.48%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.30% - 0.72% compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% - 1.3% in China). The current interventions implemented, (i.e. social distancing, workplace closures and public transport restrictions) could potentially avert 3,100 deaths (95% UI 1,500 - 4,500) over the course of the epidemic. Enhanced shielding of people aged [&ge;] 60 years could avert a further 30,500 deaths (95% UI 17,500 - 45,600) and halve ICU admissions at the peak of the outbreak. Coverage of face coverings of 60% under the assumption of 50% efficacy could be sufficient to control the epidemic. A novel therapeutic agent, which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity could reduce projected mortality to 2.55 deaths per 1,000 population (95% UI 1.58 - 3.84).

54,"Economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","The US population faces stressors associated with suicide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation may inform policies and programs to prevent suicide. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from two, nationally representative surveys of US adults: The 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (conducted March 31 to April 13). We compared suicidal ideation in 2017-2018 to suicidal ideation in 2020. We estimated the association between stressors - job loss, trouble paying rent, and social isolation - and suicidal ideation in 2020 using bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance. Suicidal ideation increased more than fourfold, from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), while losing a job was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Feeling alone was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.4). We conclude that suicidal ideation increased more than fourfold during the COVID-19 pandemic. Difficulty paying rent and loneliness were most associated with suicidal ideation.

55,Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and social distancing: A cross-sectional study,"Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, a controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic within the period of June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = 0.017) with individuals' perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = 0.032) and education level (P < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted 'knowledge about social distancing'. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < 0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the 'perception of COVID-19 origin' and the 'perception and knowledge about social distancing'.",Lenisse M.

56,MAJORA: Continuous integration supporting decentralised sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance,"Genomic epidemiology has become an increasingly common tool for epidemic response. Recent technological advances have made it possible to sequence genomes rapidly enough to inform outbreak response, and cheaply enough to justify dense sampling of even large epidemics. With increased availability of sequencing it is possible for agile networks of sequencing facilities to collaborate on the sequencing and analysis of epidemic genomic data.

In response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium was formed with the aim of rapidly sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes as part of a national-scale genomic surveillance strategy. The network consists of universities, academic institutes, regional sequencing centres and the four UK Public Health Agencies.

We describe the development and deployment of Majora, an encompassing digital infrastructure to address the challenge of collecting and integrating both genomic sequencing data and sample-associated metadata produced across the COG-UK network. The system was designed and implemented pragmatically to stand up capacity rapidly in a pandemic caused by a novel virus.

57,Production of ORF8 protein from SARS-CoV-2 using an inducible virus-mediated expression-system in suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spread worldwide in 2019, is an urgent problem to be overcome. The ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to be associated with the symptoms of COVID-19, according to reports of clinical studies. However, little is known about the function of ORF8. As one of the ways to advance the functional analysis of ORF8, mass production of ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure is necessary. In this study, we attempted to produce ORF8 protein by chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells. An ORF8-producing line was generated by the Agrobacterium method. As a result, the production of ORF8 of 8.8 {+/-} 1.4 mg/L of culture medium was confirmed. SDS-PAGE and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis confirmed that the ORF8 produced by this system is a dimeric form with a three-dimensional structure, unlike that produced in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was suggested that the ORF8 produced by this system was N-glycosylated. Through this study, we succeeded in producing ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure in a chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY2 cells. It is expected that the functional analysis of ORF8 will be advanced using the ORF8 produced by this system and that it will greatly contribute to the development of vaccines and antibodies against ORF8.",Tomohiro Imamura; Noriyoshi Isozumi; Yasuki Higashimura; Shinya Ohki; Masashi Mori,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207506,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.325910,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
58,Extremely potent human monoclonal antibodies from convalescent Covid-19 patients,"Human monoclonal antibodies are safe, preventive and therapeutic tools, that can be rapidly developed to help restore the massive health and economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. By single cell sorting 4277 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific memory B cells from 14 Covid-19 survivors, 453 neutralizing antibodies were identified and 220 of them were expressed as IgG. Up to 65,9% of monoclonals neutralized the wild type virus at a concentration of >500 ng/mL, 23,6% neutralized the virus in the range of 100 - 500 ng/mL and 9,1% had a neutralization potency in the range of 10 - 100 ng/mL. Only 1,4% neutralized the authentic virus with a potency of 1-10 ng/mL. We found that the most potent neutralizing antibodies are extremely rare and recognize the RBD, followed in potency by antibodies that recognize the S1 domain, the S-protein trimeric structure and the S2 subunit. The three most potent monoclonal antibodies identified were able to neutralize the wild type and D614G mutant viruses with less than 10 ng/mL and are good candidates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic tools against SARS-CoV-2.

59,"SARS-CoV-2 has observably higher propensity to accept uracil as nucleotide substitution: Prevalence of amino acid substitutions and their predicted functional implications in circulating SARS-CoV-2 in India up to July, 2020","SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as pandemic all over the world since late 2019. In this study, we investigated the diversity of the virus in the context of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. Full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of the circulating viruses from all over India were collected from GISAID, an open data repository, until 25thJuly, 2020. We have focused on the non-synonymous changes across the genome that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Analysis of the genomic signatures of the non-synonymous mutations demonstrated a strong association between the time of sample collection and the accumulation of genetic diversity. Most of these isolates from India belonged to the A2a clade (63.4%) which has overcome the selective pressure and is spreading rapidly across several continents. Interestingly a new clade I/A3i has emerged as the second-highest prevalent type among the Indian isolates, comprising 25.5% of the Indian sequences. Emergence of new mutations in the S protein was observed. Major SARS-CoV-2 clades in India have defining mutations in the RdRp. Maximum accumulation of mutations was observed in ORF1a.

Other than the clade-defining mutations, few representative non-synonymous mutations were checked against the available crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the DynaMut server to assess their thermodynamic stability. We have observed that SARS-CoV-2 genomes contain more uracil than any other nucleotide. Furthermore, substitution of nucleotides to uracil was highest among the non-synonymous mutations observed. The A+U content in SARS-CoV-2 genome is much higher compared to other RNA viruses, suggesting that the virus RdRp has a propensity towards uracil incorporation in the genome. This implies that thymidine analogues may have a better chance to competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication than other nucleotide analogues.",Subrata Roy; Himadri Nath; Abinash Mallick; Subhajit Biswas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207241,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.329771,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
60,Making the invisible enemy visible,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, structural biologists have rushed to solve the structures of the 28 proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome in order to understand the viral life cycle and enable structure-based drug design. In addition to the 200 structures from SARS-CoV previously solved, 367 structures covering 16 of the viral proteins have been released in the span of only 6 months.

These structural models serve as basis for research worldwide to understand how the virus hijacks human cells, for structure-based drug design and to aid in the development of vaccines. However, errors often occur in even the most careful structure determination - and are even more common among these structures, which were solved under immense pressure.

From the beginning of the pandemic, the Coronavirus Structural Taskforce has categorized, evaluated and reviewed all of these experimental protein structures in order to help downstream users and original authors. Our website also offers improved models for many key structures, which have been used by Folding@Home, OpenPandemics, the EU JEDI COVID-19 challenge, and others. Here, we describe our work for the first time, give an overview of common problems, and describe a few of these structures that have since acquired better versions in the worldwide Protein Data Bank, either from new data or as depositor re-versions using our suggested changes.",Tristan Croll; Kay Diederichs; Florens Fischer; Cameron Fyfe; Yunyun Gao; Sam Horrell; Agnel Praveen Joseph; Luise Kandler; Oliver Kippes; Ferdinand Kirsten; Konstantin Müller; Kristopher Nolte; Alexander Payne; Matthew G.

61,Mass spectrometric based detection of protein nucleotidylation in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2, encode a nucleotidyl transferase in the N-terminal NiRAN domain of the non-structural protein (nsp) 12 protein within the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 1-3. Though the substrate targets of the viral nucleotidyl transferase are unknown, NiRAN active sites are highly conserved and essential for viral replication 3. We show, for the first time, the detection and sequence location of GMP-modified amino acids in nidovirus RdRP-associated proteins using heavy isotope-assisted MS and MS/MS peptide sequencing. We identified lys-143 in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein, nsp7, as a primary site of nucleotidylation in vitro that uses a phosphoramide bond to covalently attach with GMP. In SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins, we demonstrate a unique O-linked GMP attachment on nsp7 ser-1, whose formation required the presence of nsp12. It is clear that additional nucleotidylation sites remain undiscovered, which includes the possibility that nsp12 itself may form a transient GMP adduct in the NiRAN active site that has eluted detection in these initial studies due to instability of the covalent attachment. Our results demonstrate new strategies for detecting GMP-peptide linkages that can be adapted for higher throughput screening using mass spectrometric technologies. These data are expected to be important for a rapid and timely characterization of a new enzymatic activity in SARS-CoV-2 that may be an attractive drug target aimed at limiting viral replication in infected patients.",Michael R Sussman; Brian J Conti; Robert N Kirchdoerfer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.307546,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330324,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
62,NSP 11 of SARS-CoV-2 is an Intrinsically Disordered Protein,"The intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDPRs) are known to be responsible for multiple cellular processes and are associated with many chronic diseases. In viruses, the existence of disordered proteome is also proven and are related with its conformational dynamics inside the host. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a large proteome, in which, structure and functions of many proteins are not known as of yet. Previously, we have investigated the dark proteome of SARS-CoV-2. However, the disorder status of non-structural protein 11 (nsp11) was not possible because of very small in size, just 13 amino acid long, and for most of the IDP predictors, the protein size should be at least 30 amino acid long. Also, the structural dynamics and function status of nsp11 was not known. Hence, we have performed extensive experimentation on nsp11. Our results, based on the Circular dichroism spectroscopy gives characteristic disordered spectrum for IDPs. Further, we investigated the conformational behaviour of nsp11 in the presence of membrane mimetic environment, alpha helix inducer, and natural osmolyte. In the presence of negatively charged and neutral liposomes, nsp11 remains disordered. However, with SDS micelle, it adopted an -helical conformation, suggesting the helical propensity of nsp11. At the end, we again confirmed the IDP behaviour of nsp11 using molecular dynamics simulations.",Kundlik Gadhave; Prateek Kumar; Ankur Kumar; Taniya Bhardwaj; Neha Garg; Rajanish Giri,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330324,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330068,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
63,Umbilical cord blood derived microglia-like cells to model COVID-19 exposure,"Microglia, the resident brain immune cells, play a critical role in normal brain development, and are impacted by the intrauterine environment, including maternal immune activation and inflammatory exposures. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.",Roy H.

64,An open-label prospective observational study of antiandrogen and non-antiandrogen early pharmacological approaches in females with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The Pre-AndroCoV Female Trial.,"Background: While COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population. Materials and methods: Females with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression. Results: In total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 +- 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 +- 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 +- 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 +- 0.5), headache (1.2 +- 0.5), dry cough (1.2 +- 61617; 0.5), myalgia (1.2 +- 0.4), nauseas (1.3 +- 0.5) and weakness (1.3 +- 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication. Conclusions: A sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.",Flavio A Cadegiani; Carlos Gustavo Wambier; Andy Goren,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330068,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206870,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
65,WORLDWIDE CASE FATALITY RATIO OF COVID-19 OVER TIME,"ABSTRACT Background The case fatality ratio (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to be variable among different countries and regions but few analyses have tracked this ratio worldwide over time. Methods The primary objective was to assess the time-course evolution of CFR of COVID-19 in all countries with available data and secondary objective was to evaluate associations between country-wise CFR and country-level health, human development, demographic and economic parameters. Day-wise data of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country was extracted from a public repository and countries with at least 1000 cases on cutoff date were clustered by unsupervised kmeans on the basis of deaths per 100000 population (DP100K). Day-wise CFR (cumulative deaths divided by cumulative cases, multiplied by 100) for each country and cluster (country group) was plotted as time-series and country-level parameters were tested for association with CFR using weighted multiple linear regression. Results On September 24, 2020 there were 32140504 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 981792 deaths reported from 184 countries for a worldwide CFR of 3.06 % (95%CI 3.05 -3.07). Unsupervised k-means clustering in 157 countries with at least 1000 reported cases resulted in Clusters (country groups) A, B, C, D and E with centroid DP100K and CFR of 0.100 and 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 0.503 and 2.28 (95% CI 2.23-2.33), 1.816 and 1.73 (95% CI 1.71-1.75), 7.395 and 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76),4 and 36.303 and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively. In a log-log analysis DP100K and CFR were significantly positively correlated (R=0.3570, p<0.001) with each other. All country groups and majority of included countries showed a pattern of gradually increasing CFR from the beginning of pandemic, followed by a plateau and then a steady decline in CFR. Among 10 country-level parameters, GDP per capita ({beta}=-0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population ({beta}=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality from air pollution ({beta}=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density ({beta}=-0.570, p< 0.000) were significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio ({beta}=0.431, p=0.000) and age ({beta}=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR. Conclusions The CFR of COVID-19 has gradually increased over time in majority of countries at various stages of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and a steady decline. Population level COVID-19 mortality burden and CFR are significantly positively associated with each other.",Rohan Chaubal; Sadhana Kannan; Navin Khattry; Sudeep Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330068,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206599,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
66,"Markers Of Coagulation And Hemostatic Activation Identify COVID-19 Patients At High Risk For Thrombotic Events, ICU Admission and Intubation","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a coagulopathy giving rise to venous and arterial thrombotic events. The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications. Methods: COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as [&ge;] 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission and those who were pregnant. Results: Of 276 patients (mean age 59 {+/-} 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race) who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer [&ge;] 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer [&ge;] 2000 ng/mL and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint. Conclusions: Admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events. Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients.",Darwish Alabyad; Srikant Rangaraju; Michael Liu; Rajeel Imran; Christine Kempton; Milad Sharifpour; Sara Auld; Manila Gaddh; Roman Sniecinski; Cheryl L Maier; Jeannette Guarner; Alexander Duncan; Fadi Nahab,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.329748,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206540,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
67,A haemagglutination test for rapid detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of seroconversion in populations, detection of seroconversion after vaccination, and for seeking evidence for a level of antibody that may be protective against COVID-19 disease. Several high-performance commercial tests have been described, but these require centralised laboratory facilities that are comparatively expensive, and therefore not available universally. Red cell agglutination tests have a long history in blood typing, and general serology through linkage of reporter molecules to the red cell surface. They do not require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied as a Point of Care Test (POCT). We describe a red cell agglutination test for the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We show that the Haemagglutination Test (HAT) has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a PCR diagnosed infection. The HAT can be titrated, detects rising titres in the first five days of hospital admission, correlates well with a commercial test that detects antibodies to the RBD, and can be applied as a point of care test. The developing reagent is composed of a previously described nanobody to a conserved glycophorin A epitope on red cells, linked to the RBD from SARS-CoV-2. It can be lyophilised for ease of shipping. We have scaled up production of this reagent to one gram, which is sufficient for ten million tests, at a cost of ~0.27 UK pence per test well. Aliquots of this reagent are ready to be supplied to qualified groups anywhere in the world that need to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but do not have the facilities for high throughput commercial tests.",Alain Townsend; Pramila Rijal; Julie Xiao; Tiong Kit Tan; Kuan-Ying A Huang; Lisa Schimanski; Jiangdong Ho; Nimesh Gupta; Rolle Rahikainen; Philippa C Matthews; Derrick Crook; Sarah Hoosdally; Teresa Street; Justine Rudkin; Nicole Stoesser; Fredrik Karpe; Matthew Neville; Rutger Ploeg; Marta Oliveira; David J Roberts; Abigail A Lamikanra; Hoi Pat Tsang; Abbie Bown; Richard Vipond; Alexander J Mentzer; Julian C Knight; Andrew Kwok; Gavin Screaton; Juthathip Mongkolsapaya; Wanwisa Dejnirattisai; Piyada Supasa; Paul Klenerman; Christina Dold; Kenneth Baillie; Shona C Moore; Peter JM Openshaw; Malcolm G Semple; Lance CW Turtle; Mark Ainsworth; Alice Allcock; Sally Beer; Sagida Bibi; Elizabeth Clutterbuck; Alexis Espinosa; Maria Mendoza; Dominique Georgiou; Teresa Lockett; Jose Martinez; Elena Perez; Veronica Sanchez; Giuseppe Scozzafava; Alberto Sobrinodiaz; Hannah Thraves; Etienne Joly,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.329748,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205831,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
68,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Management of Heart Failure -A United Kingdom Patient Questionnaire Study,"Aim The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges to healthcare globally, necessitating rapid restructuring of service provision. This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services. Methods and Results The survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF), a UK HF patient charity. Survey Monkey was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the PMF online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (out-patient hospital and community HF clinics). 1050 responses were collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID19 (mean 7+/-2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared to anxiety regarding HF (6.1+/-2.4; p<0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged </=60 years about HF (6.3+/-2.2 versus 5.9+/-2.5 in those aged >60 years; p=0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3+/-2.3 versus 6.7+/-2.6 those aged >60 years; p<0.001). 65% respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period. 37% reported disruption to medication prescription services and 34% reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. 32% expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients regarding COVID-19 and HF. Cancellation or postponement of scheduled clinic appointments, investigations, procedures, prescription and monitoring services were implicated as sources of anxiety.",Rajiv Sankaranarayanan; Nick Hartshorne-Evans; Sam Redmond-Lyon; Jill Wilson; Hani Essa; Alastair Gray; Louise Clayton; Carys Barton; Fozia Z Ahmed; Colin Cunnington; Duwarakan Satchithananda; Clare Murphy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206870,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205328,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
69,"The relationship between neighborhood poverty and COVID-19 mortality within racial/ethnic groups (Cook County, Illinois)","Background Prior research has identified higher rates of COVID-19 mortality among people of color (relative to non-Hispanic whites) and populations in high-poverty neighborhoods (relative to wealthier neighborhoods). It is unclear, however, whether non-Hispanic whites in high-poverty neighborhoods experience elevated mortality, or whether people of color living in wealthy areas are relatively protected. Exploring socioeconomic position in combination with race/ethnicity can lead to a more detailed understanding of the specific processes that result in COVID-19 inequities. Methods and Findings We used census and individual-level mortality data for the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic/Latinx populations of Cook County, Illinois, USA. We excluded deaths related to nursing homes and other institutions. We calculated age and gender-adjusted mortality rates by race/ethnicity, census tract poverty quartile, and age group (0-64 and [&ge;]65 years). Within all racial/ethnic groups, COVID-19 mortality rates were greatest in the highest-poverty quartile and lowest in the lowest-poverty quartile. The mortality rate for younger non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was 13.5 times that of younger non-Hispanic whites in the lowest-poverty quartile (95% CI: 8.5, 21.4). For young people in the highest-poverty quartile, the non-Hispanic white and Black mortality rates were similar. Among younger people in the lowest-poverty quartile, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx people had mortality rates nearly three times that of non-Hispanic whites. For the older population, the mortality rate among non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was less than that of lowest-poverty non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. Conclusions Our findings suggest racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are partly, but not entirely, attributable to the higher average socioeconomic position of non-Hispanic whites relative to the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. Future research on health equity in COVID-19 outcomes should collect and analyze individual-level data on the potential mechanisms driving population distributions of exposure, severe illness, and death.",Justin M Feldman; Mary T Bassett,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206870,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206318,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
70,"Strategies for infection control and prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 4,554 employees of a university hospital in Munich, Germany","Background Hospital staff are at high risk of infection during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We analysed the exposure characteristics, efficacy of protective measures, and transmission dynamics in this hospital-wide prospective seroprevalence study. Methods and Findings Overall, 4554 individuals were tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Individual risk factors, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), occupational exposure, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and correlated to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres and PCR testing results. Odds ratios with corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate associations between individual factors and seropositivity. Spatio-temporal trajectories of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and staff mobility within the hospital were visualised to identify local hotspots of virus transmission. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody was 2.4% [95% CI 1.9-2.9]. Patient-facing staff, including those working in COVID-19 areas, had a similar probability of being seropositive as non-patient-facing staff. Prior interaction with SARS-CoV-2-infected co-workers or private contacts and unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients increased the probability of seropositivity. Loss of smell and taste had the highest positive predictive value for seropositivity. The rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 25.9%, and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres were observed in symptomatic individuals. Spatio-temporal hotspots of SARS-CoV-2-positive staff and patients only showed partial overlap. Conclusions Patient-facing work in a healthcare facility during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be safe if adequate PPE and hygiene measures are applied. The high numbers of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections that escaped detection by symptomatic testing underline the value of cross-sectional seroprevalence studies. Unprotected contact is a major risk factor for infection and argues for the rigorous implementation of hygiene measures.",Johanna Erber; Verena Kappler; Bernhard Haller; Hrvoje Mijocevic; Ana Galhoz; Clarissa Prazeres da Costa; Friedemann Gebhardt; Natalia Graf; Dieter Hoffmann; Markus Thaler; Elke Lorenz; Hedwig Roggendorf; Florian Kohlmayer; Andreas Henkel; Michael M Menden; Juergen Ruland; Christoph D Spinner; Ulrike Protzer; Percy Knolle; Paul Lingor,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206599,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206136,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

In India, the situation can be expected to move towards betterment soon, and once that happens the situation in the World as a whole would start improving. We shall demonstrate that as long as the rate of change of the logarithm of the cumulative total number of cases with respect to time in a pandemic continues to reduce, the pattern of growth would continue to remain nearly exponential, and as soon as it is seen that the rate of change starts to become nearly constant the growth can be expected to start to change towards a nearly logarithmic pattern.",Hemanta Kumar Baruah,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206599,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206839,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

73,"A systematic review of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of physicians, health workers, and the general population about Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Background: Understanding people, physicians, and healthcare workers' knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAPs) can help to achieve the outcomes of planned behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize the current evidence on KAPs regarding COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 Jul 2020. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. PROSPERO registration code: (CRD42020186755). Results: Fifty-two studies encompassing 49786 participants were included in this review. 45.76% of the participants were male. The mean age of the participants was 32.6 years. 44.2% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 46.2% as fair quality, and remaining (9.6%) as low quality. 30.76% examined all three components of the KAPs model. The knowledge component was reported as good, fair, and poor in 59%, 34%, and 7%, respectively. Of the studies that examined the attitude component, 82% reported a positive attitude, 11% a fairly positive attitude, and 7% a negative attitude. For the practice component, 52% reported good practice, 44% fair practice, and 4% poor practice. Conclusion: This systematic review showed that the overall KAP components in the included studies were at an acceptable level. In general, knowledge was at a good level, the attitude was positive and practice was at a fairly good level. Using an integrated international system can help better evaluate these components and compare them between countries.",Saeede Saadatjoo; Maryam Miri; Soheil Hassanipour; Hosein Ameri Sr.; Morteza Arab-Zozani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206540,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206094,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
74,Temporal Analysis of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donations Reveals Significant Decrease in Neutralizing Capacity Over Time,"COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) received approval for use under an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for treatment of seriously ill patients. Use of CCP units with a signal-to-cutoff ratio of [&ge;]12 using the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (OVSARS2IgG) is authorized. Little is known about the relationship between this ratio and the neutralizing capacity of plasma/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2 virus. We measured the neutralizing capacity of 981 samples from 196 CCP donors 7-119 days post initial donation (DPID). Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Importantly, while 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT90/PRNT50) of donations met the FDA minimum titer of 1:80 initially, only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met this cut-off [&ge;]85 DPID. A subset of 91 donations were evaluated using the OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy. The correlation of OVSARS2IgG results to neutralizing capacity allowed extrapolation to CCP therapy efficacy results. CCP with OVSARS2IgG ratios in the therapeutically beneficial group had neutralizing titers of [&ge;]1:640 (PRNT50) and/or [&ge;]1:80 (PRNT90).

75,Multi-omics highlights ABO plasma protein as a causal risk factor for COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the current health crisis. Despite intensive research efforts, the genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19 remain poorly understood. We therefore used an integrative genomics (IG) approach to identify candidate genes responsible for COVID-19 and its severity. We used Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) and summary-based Mendelian randomization to combine gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Lung eQTL (n=1,038) and eQTLGen (n=31,784) studies with published COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Additionally, we used COLOC to integrate plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from the INTERVAL study (n=3,301) with COVID-19-associated loci. Finally, we determined any causal associations between plasma proteins and COVID-19 using multi-variable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). We found that the expression of 20 genes in lung and 31 genes in blood was associated with COVID-19. Of these genes, only three (LZTFL1, SLC6A20 and ABO) had been previously linked with COVID-19 in GWAS. The novel loci included genes involved in interferon pathways (IL10RB, IFNAR2 and OAS1). Plasma ABO protein, which is associated with blood type in humans, demonstrated a significant causal relationship with COVID-19 in MR analysis; increased plasma levels were associated with an increased risk of having COVID-19 and risk of severe COVID-19. In summary, our study identified genes associated with COVID-19 that may be prioritized for future investigation. Importantly, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal association between plasma ABO protein and COVID-19.",Ana I Hernandez Cordero; Xuan Li; Stephen Milne; Chen Xi Yang; Yohan Bosse; Philippe Joubert; Wim Timens; Maarten van den Berge; David Nickle; Ke Hao; Don D Sin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205831,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207118,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
76,"Sars-Cov-2 in Argentina: Lockdown, Mobility, and Contagion","There is a debate in Argentina about the effectiveness of mandatory lockdown measures in containing COVID-19 that lasts five months making it one of the longest in the World. The population effort to comply the lockdown has been decreasing over time given the economic and social costs that it entails. We contributes by analyzing the Argentinian case through information of mobility and contagion given answers to recurrent questions on these topics. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing the effects of lockdown measures and the regional relaxation on the numbers of rate of new infections. We also respond to issues of internal political discussion on regional contagion and the effect of marches and unexpected crowd events.We use pool, fixed and random effects panel data modeling and Granger causality tests identifying relations between mobility and contagion. Our results show that lockdown in Argentina has been effective in reducing the mobility but not in way that reduces the rate of contagion. Strict lockdown seems to be effective in short periods of time and by extend it without complementary measures loss effectiveness. Contagion rate seems to be discretely displaced in time and resurging amidst slowly increasing in mobility.",Juan M.C.

77,Serological testing in addition to PCR screening for the re-opening of American colleges and universities: potential for cost-savings without compromising pandemic mitigation,"Importance. The addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan. Objectives. To determine whether a college/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: We assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Testing costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing. Results: Including baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: While regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.",Youngji Jo; Ruby Singh; Gabriella Rao; Sandro Galea; Brooke E Nichols,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205328,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206680,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
78,Development of a customised data management system for a COVID-19-adapted colorectal cancer pathway,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems around the world. To mitigate the risks of those referred with possible colorectal cancer during the pandemic we implemented a clinical pathway which required a customised data management system for robust operation. Here, we describe the principal concepts and evaluation of the performance of a spreadsheet-based data management system. Methods: A system was developed using Microsoft Excel 2007 aiming to retain the spreadsheets inherent intuitiveness of direct data entry. Data was itemised limiting entry errors. Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was used to construct a user-friendly interface to enhance efficiency of data entry and segregate the data required for operational tasks. This was done with built-in loop-back data entry. Finally data derivation and analysis was performed to facilitate pathway monitoring. Results: For a pathway which required rapid implementation and development of a customised data management system, the use of a spreadsheet was advantageous due to its user-friendly direct data entry capability. Its function was enhanced by UserForm and large data handling by data segregation using VBA macros. Data validation and conditional formatting minimised data entry errors. Computation by the COUNT function facilitated live data monitoring on a dashboard. During the three months the pathway ran for, the system processed 36 nodal data points for each of the included 837 patients. Data monitoring confirmed its accuracy. Conclusion: Large volume data management using a spreadsheet system is possible with appropriate data definition and VBA programmed data segregation. Regular input and optimisation by clinicians made the system adaptable for rapid implementation.",Frances Gunn; Janice Miller; Malcolm G Dunlop; Farhat V N Din; Yasuko Maeda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206318,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206920,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
79,Rationale and prognosis of repurposed drugs with risk stratification of patients in oxygen support in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"There has been rapid development of clinical trials conducted on antivirals, immunomodulators, and other therapies against COVID-19. The rising number of trials has led to duplication and a need for curation of available outcomes from treatments that have been followed across the world. The rising number of trials has led to duplication and a need for curation of available outcomes from treatments that have been followed across the world. We have conducted a systematic review and meta analysis that focus on evaluating the clinical outcomes of repurposed drugs against COVID-19 including Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Dexamethasome, Lopinavir-ritonavir, Favipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Convalescent plasma therapy. Twenty-nine articles were included in this study after thorough literature search and performed subgroup analyses based on disease severity levels. Random effects model was adopted to estimate overall treatment effect and heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis on mortality rate showed significant overall effect in the treatment group of studies having critically ill patients (p<0.01).Overall, our study confirmed that tocilizumab may probably reduce the mortality (<10%) of patients with COVID-19 with faster recovery time and reduce the risk of patients with lung disease in falling into oxygen support (P = 0.02). Patients on remedesivir showed no significant associations of comorbidities with risk of falling into oxygen supports. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be inefficacious in COVID-19 patients (OR 0.64; 95%CI [0.47-0.86]).Dexamethasone had marginal effect on overall mortality rate (OR 1.19; 95%CI [1.05-1.35]), and hence helpful for patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO. There was also evidence suggesting that combination therapies (serpin + Favipiravir) were helpful in reducing the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients under invasive support.",Esther Jebarani Elangovan; Vanitha Shyamili Kumar; Adhithyan Kathiravan; Raghav Mallampalli; Tiju Thomas; Gnanasambandam Subramaniyam,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206318,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206516,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
80,The relative effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on early Covid-19 mortality: natural experiment in 130 countries,"Background Concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented around the world to control Covid-19 transmission. Their general effect on reducing virus transmission is proven, but they can also be negative to mental health and economies, and transmission behaviours can also change in absence of mandated policies. Their relative impact on Covid-19 attributed mortality rates, enabling policy selection for maximal benefit with minimal disruption, is not well established. Methods We exploited variations in nine non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 130 countries (3250 observations) in two periods chosen to limit reverse causality: i) prior to first Covid-19 death (when policymakers could not possibly be reacting to deaths in their own country); and, ii) 14-days-post first Covid-19 death (when deaths were still low, on average). We examined associations with daily deaths per million in each subsequent 24-day period (the time between virus transmission and mortality) which could only be affected by the policy period. A mean score of strictness and timeliness was coded for each intervention. Days in each country were indexed in time by first reported Covid-19 death to proxy for virus transmission rate. Multivariable linear regression models of Covid-19 mortality rates on all concurrent interventions were adjusted for seasonality, potential confounders, and potential cross-country differences in their mortality definitions. Robustness was checked by removing countries with known data reporting issues and with non-linear, negative binomial, models. Results After adjusting for multiple concurrent interventions and confounders, and accounting for both timing and strictness of interventions, earlier and stricter school (-1.23 daily deaths per million, 95% CI -2.20 -0.27) and workplace closures (-0.26, 95% CI -0.46 -0.05) were associated with lower Covid-19 mortality rates. Only controlling for strictness international travel controls, and only controlling for timing later restrictions on gatherings, were also associated with lower Covid-19 mortality. Other interventions, such as stay-at-home orders or restrictions on public transport, were not significantly associated with differences in mortality rates across countries. Findings were robust across multiple statistical approaches.

81,Comparative policy analysis of face mask mandates during COVID 19 pandemic on rate of mask use in the United States,"As COVID 19 continues to spread throughout the United States, there has been a search for policies to both prevent individual infections, to slow the spread of the virus in general, and to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. Masks have proven to be a cost-effective measure in all regards, and as such some state governments have begun to mandate their use. However, while the efficacy of masks has been demonstrated, the efficacy of public policies which mandate the use of masks has not been demonstrated. This paper compares the rates of mask use in counties as defined by state policy. It is found that state mandates are strongly correlated with higher rates of mask use, and that mandating use by all individuals in public spaces is more effective than a less comprehensive mandate for mask use by all public facing employees.",Michael J Maloney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206136,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206326,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

Methods: Two MCDA assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab was designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and RT-PCR using 7 DNA standards and transcribed RNA. Results: For the N gene, MCDA was consistently faster than LAMP and RT-PCR by 10 and 20 minutes, respectively with a fastest time to detection of 5.2 minutes. RT-PCR had the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of 100 copies/reaction compared with MCDA (1000 copies/reaction) and LAMP (5000/reaction). For ORF1ab, MCDA and LAMP had similar speed with fastest time to detection at 9.7 and 8.4 minutes, respectively. LAMP was more sensitive for ORF1ab detection with 500 copies/reaction compared to MCDA (5000 copies/reaction). Conclusions: Different nucleic acid amplification methods provide different advantages. MCDA is the fastest nucleic acid amplification method for COVID-19 while RT-PCR is still the most sensitive.

84,"Renin Angiotensin System Inhibition and Susceptibility and Outcomes from COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 69,200 COVID-19 Patients","Background: Early observational studies suggested that the use of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, specifically angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, may increase the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and adversely affect the prognosis or survival of infected patients. To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies. Methods and Findings: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31). There was no significant difference in the severe Covid-19 case rate between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36), (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.12), or in mortality due to COVID-19 between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.44), (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23), (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14). Conclusions: In the most comprehensive analysis of all available data to date, treatment with RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of infection, severity of disease, or mortality due to COVID-19.

85,A multiplex microsphere IgG assay for SARS-CoV-2 using ACE2-mediated inhibition as a surrogate for neutralization,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted challenges inherent to serological detection of a novel pathogen like SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals ([&le;]5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at [&le;]5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% vs. 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7; in days from symptom onset), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled ICU patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP.

The challenge of how to communicate these then becomes apparent. Based on empirical work (total n=5,520, UK) supported by in-person interviews with public and physicians, we make recommendations on the presentation of such information. These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing (for balance) a format which conveys a higher perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10,000); using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative 'persona' who might face that highest level of risk; and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other 'personas' illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These 'personas' should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described. By contrast, giving people absolute likelihoods of other risks they face in an attempt to add context was considered less helpful.",Alexandra LJ Freeman; John Kerr; Gabriel Recchia; Claudia Schneider; Alice CE Lawrence; Leila Finikarides; Giulia Luoni; Sarah Dryhurst; David J Spiegelhalter,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206094,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206961,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
87,Assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of household-pooled universal testing to control COVID-19 epidemics,"Current outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics currently relies on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow the for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the current testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when much of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that, the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions, could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.",Pieter Jules Karel Libin; Lander Willem; Timothy Verstraeten; Andrea Torneri; Joris Vanderlocht; Niel Hens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206094,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205765,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
88,Impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals on COVID-19 mortality in different countries,"Several recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus. However, pathophysiological implications of these findings remain unknown. Here, the potential impact of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARC-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals on markedly different COVID-19 mortality levels in different countries has been investigated. The inverse correlation is documented between the prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus and COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries. In countries with similar levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, differences in COVID-19 mortality appear linked with the extend and consistency of implementations of social measures designed to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing). Collectively, these observations support the model that the level of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is one of the important determinants of the innate herd immunity against COVID-19. Together with the consistent social measures directed to limit the virus spread, high levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells appear significant determinants diminishing the COVID-19 mortality. Observations reported in this contribution should have significant impact on definitions of the herd immunity threshold required to effectively stop the pandemic in different countries across the globe.",Gennadi Glinsky,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206011,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206151,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
89,Diagnostic performance of the combined nasal and throat swab in patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19,"Background: Accurate diagnosis in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential to guide treatment and limit spread of the virus. The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain. Methods: In a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results. Results: We enrolled 1,369 consecutive patients (68 [53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3,822 tests (median 2 [1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1,369), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. Conclusions: In patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19. Diagnostic performance is significantly improved by repeated testing.",Kuan Ken Lee; Dimitrios Doudesis; Daniella Ross; Anda Bularga; Claire MacKintosh; Oliver Koch; Ingolfur Johannessen; Kate Templeton; Sara Jenks; Andrew Chapman; Anoop Shah; Atul Anand; Meghan Perry; Nicholas L Mills,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206011,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206243,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
90,Monitoring for COVID-19 by universal testing in a homeless shelter in Germany: a prospective feasibility cohort study,"Background: Living conditions in homeless shelters may facilitate the transmission of COVID-19. Social determinants and pre-existing health conditions place homeless people at increased risk of severe disease. Described outbreaks in homeless shelters resulted in high proportions of infected residents and staff members. In addition to other infection prevention strategies, regular shelter-wide (universal) testing for COVID-19 may be valuable, depending on the level of community transmission and when resources permit. Methods: This was a prospective feasibility cohort study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter with 106 beds in Berlin, Germany. Co-researchers were recruited from the shelter staff. A PCR analysis of saliva or self-collected nasal/oral swab was performed weekly over a period of 3 weeks in July 2020. Acceptability and implementation barriers were analyzed by process evaluation using mixed methods including evaluation sheets, focus group discussion and a structured questionnaire. Results: Ninety-three out of 124 (75%) residents were approached to participate in the study. Fifty-one out of the 93 residents (54.8%) gave written informed consent. High retention rates (88.9% - 93.6%) of a weekly respiratory specimen were reached, but repeated collection attempts, as well as assistance were required. A self-collected nasal/oral swab was considered easier and more hygienic to collect than a saliva specimen. No resident was tested positive. Language barriers were the main reason for non-participation. Flexibility of sample collection schedules, the use of video and audio materials, and concise written information were the main recommendations of the co-researchers for future implementation. Conclusion: Voluntary universal testing for COVID-19 is feasible in homeless shelters. Universal testing of high-risk facilities will require flexible approaches, considering the level of the community transmission, the available resources, and the local recommendations. Lack of human resources and laboratory capacity may be a major barrier for implementation of universal testing, requiring adapted approaches compared to standard individual testing. Assisted self-collection of specimens and barrier free communication may facilitate implementation in homeless shelters. Program planning must consider needs and life situation of homeless people, and guarantee confidentiality and autonomy.",Andreas K.

91,SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence and Seroprevalence among Healthcare Workers in Belgian Hospitals: Baseline Results of a Prospective Cohort Study,"Background: Given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the occurrence of a second wave, assessing the burden of disease among health care workers (HCWs) is crucial. We aim to document the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs in Belgian hospitals, and to study potential risk factors for the infection in order to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in healthcare institutions. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline results (April 22 - April 26) of an ongoing cohort study. All staff who were present in the hospital during the sampling period and whose profession involved contact with patients were eligible. Fourteen hospitals across Belgium and 50 HCW per hospital were randomly selected. RT-qPCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs, and a semi-quantitative IgG ELISA was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera. Individual characteristics likely to be associated with seropositivity were collected using an online questionnaire. Findings: 698 participants completed the questionnaire; 80.8% were women, median age was 39.5, and 58.5% were nurses. Samples were collected on all 699 participants. The weighted anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 7.7% (95%CI, 4.7%-12.2%), while 1.1% (95%CI, 0.4%-3.0%) of PCR results were positive. Unprotected contact with a confirmed case was the only factor associated with seropositivity (PR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.4-3.2). Interpretation: Most Belgian HCW did not show evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by late April 2020, and unprotected contact was the most important risk factor. This confirms the importance of widespread availability of protective equipment and use of adequate IPC measures in hospital settings.",Laure Mortgat; Cyril Barbezange; Natalie Fischer; Leo Heyndrickx; Veronik Hutse; Isabelle Thomas; Bea Vuylsteke; Kevin Arien; Isabelle Desombere; Els Duysburgh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20205401,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20204545,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
92,The excess insulin requirement in severe COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis is related to the severity of respiratory failure and pre-existing diabetes.,"Abstract Objective Severe COVID-19 has been anecdotally associated with high insulin requirements. It has been proposed that this may be driven by a direct diabetogenic effect of the virus that is unique to SARS-CoV-2, but evidence to support this is limited. To explore this, we compared insulin requirements in patients with severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis. Research Design Retrospective cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit between March and June 2020. A historical control cohort of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis patients was identified from routinely collected audit data. Results Insulin requirements were similar in patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis after adjustment for pre-existing diabetes and severity of respiratory failure. Conclusions In this single center study, we could not find evidence of a unique diabetogenic effect of COVID-19. We suggest that high insulin requirements in this disease relate to its propensity to cause severe respiratory failure in patients with pre-existing metabolic disease.",Sam Lockhart; Harry Griffiths; Bogdan Petrisor; Ammara Usman; Julia Calvo-Latorre; Laura Heales; Vishakha Bansiya; Razeen Mahroof; Andrew Conway Morris,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20204545,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206284,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
93,Chest pain presentations to hospital during the COVID-19 lockdown: lessons for public health media campaigns,"Objective: Emergency Department (ED) attendances with chest pain reduced during the COVID-19 lockdown. To understand factors influencing patient decision to attend hospital, we performed a local service evaluation project in NHS Lothian. Methods: We collated data on online searches and local clinical services on the number of ED presentations and chest pain clinic (CPC) referrals with suspected acute coronary syndrome between January and May 2020 and compared findings with the same period in 2019. We also carried out 28 semi-structured telephone interviews with patients who presented with chest pain during lockdown and in patients with known coronary heart disease under the outpatient care of a cardiologist in April and May 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and salient themes and issues documented as verbatim extracts. Results: Online searches for the term chest pain doubled after 01/03/2020, peaking in week commencing 22/03/2020 and returning to 2019 levels during April 2020. In contrast, chest pain presentations to ED and CPC decreased, with the greatest reduction in the final week of March 2020 (128 v 287 (average weekly ED attendance 2019), and 6 v 23 (average weekly CPC referral 2019)). This aligned with key government messages to Protect the NHS and the NHS is open campaign. Patient interviews revealed three main themes; 1) pandemic help-seeking behaviour2) COVID-19 exposure concerns; 3) favourable Hospital experience if admitted. Conclusions: Dynamic monitoring of public health and media messaging should evaluate public response to healthcare campaigns to ensure the net impact on health, pandemic and non-pandemic related, is optimised.",Amy V Ferry; Collette Keanie; Martin A Denvir; Nicholas L Mills; Fiona E Strachan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20204545,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20203687,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
94,Vitamin D status and seroconversion for COVID-19 in UK healthcare workers who isolated for COVID-19 like symptoms during the 2020 pandemic.,"Background: It is clear that in UK healthcare workers, COVID-19 infections and deaths were more likely to be in staff who were of BAME origin. This has led to much speculation about the role of vitamin D in healthcare worker COVID-19 infections. We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in NHS staff who have isolated with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and relate this to vitamin D status. Methods: We recruited NHS healthcare workers between 12th to 22nd May 2020 as part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). We measured anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies using a combined IgG, IgA and IgM ELISA (The Binding Site). Vitamin D status was determined by measurement of serum 25(OH)D3 using the AB SCIEX Triple Quad 4500 mass spectrometry system. Findings: Of the 392 NHS healthcare workers, 214 (55%) had seroconverted for COVID-19. A total of 61 (15{middle dot}6%) members of staff were vitamin D deficient (<30 nmol/l) with significantly more staff from BAME backgrounds or in a junior doctor role being deficient. Vitamin D levels were lower in those who were younger, had a higher BMI (>30 kg/m2), and were male. Multivariate analysis revealed that BAME and COVID-19 seroconversion were independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency. Staff who were vitamin D deficient were more likely to self-report symptoms of body aches and pains but importantly not the respiratory symptoms of cough and breathlessness. Vitamin D levels were lower in those COVID-19 positive staff who reported fever, but this did not reach statistical significance. Within the whole cohort there was an increase in seroconversion in staff with vitamin D deficiency compared to those without vitamin D deficiency (n=44/61, 72% vs n=170/331, 51%; p=0{middle dot} 003); this was particularly marked in the proportion of BAME males who were vitamin D deficient compared to non-vitamin D deficient BAME males (n=17/18, 94% vs n=12/23, 52%; p=0{middle dot}005). Multivariate analysis revealed that vitamin D deficiency was an independent risk factor for seroconversion (OR 2{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}41- 4{middle dot} 80; p=0{middle dot}002). Interpretation: In those healthcare workers who have isolated due to symptoms of COVID-19, those of BAME ethnicity are at the highest risk of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for COVID-19 seroconversion for NHS healthcare workers especially in BAME male staff.",Aduragbemi A Faniyi; Sebastian T Lugg; Sian E Faustini; Craig Webster; Joanne E Duffy; Martin Hewison; Adrian Shields; Peter Nightingale; Alex G Richter; David R Thickett,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206284,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206706,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
95,Performance of Existing and Novel Surveillance Case Definitions for COVID-19 in the Community,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents with a broad range of symptoms. Existing COVID-19 case definitions were developed from early reports of severely ill, primarily hospitalized, patients. Symptom-based case definitions that guide public health surveillance and individual patient management in the community must be optimized for COVID-19 pandemic control. Methods: We collected daily symptom diaries and performed RT-PCR on respiratory specimens over a 14-day period in 185 community members exposed to a household contact with COVID-19 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas. We interpreted the discriminatory performance (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, F-1 score, Youden's index, and prevalence estimation) of individual symptoms and common case definitions according to two principal surveillance applications (i.e., individual screening and case counting). We also constructed novel case definitions using an exhaustive search with over 73 million symptom combinations and calculated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by children versus adults. Findings: Common COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (86-96%) but low positive predictive value (PPV) (36-49%; F-1 score 52-63) in this community cohort. The top performing novel symptom combinations included taste or smell dysfunction. They also improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F-1 score 78-80) and reduced the number of false positive symptom screens. Performance indicators were generally lower for children (<18 years of age). Interpretation: Existing COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in community members with COVID-19. However, they led to many false positive symptom screens and poorly estimated community prevalence. Absent unlimited, timely testing capacity, more accurate case definitions may help focus public health resources. Novel symptom combinations incorporating taste or smell dysfunction as a primary component better balanced sensitivity and specificity. Case definitions tailored specifically for children versus adults should be further explored.",Hannah E. Reses; Mark Fajans; Scott H. Lee; Charles M. Heilig; Victoria T. Chu; Natalie J.

97,Dilution-based Evaluation of Airborne Infection Risk - Thorough Expansion of Wells-Riley Model,"Evaluation of airborne infection risk with spatial and temporal resolutions is indispensable for the design of proper interventions fighting infectious respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19), because the distribution of aerosol contagions is both spatially and temporally non-uniform. However, the well-recognized Wells-Riley model and modified Wells-Riley model (i.e., the rebreathed-fraction model) are limited to the well-mixed condition and unable to evaluate airborne infection risk spatially and temporally, which could result in overestimation or underestimation of airborne infection risk. This study proposes a dilution-based evaluation method for airborne infection risk. The method proposed is benchmarked by the Wells-Riley model and modified Wells-Riley model, which indicates that the method proposed is a thorough expansion of the Wells-Riley model for evaluation of airborne infection risk with both spatial and temporal resolutions. Experiments in a mock hospital ward also demonstrate that the method proposed effectively evaluates the airborne infection risk both spatially and temporally.",Sheng ZHANG; Zhang Lin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20203687,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206391,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
98,"Intra-county modeling of COVID-19 infection with human mobility: assessing spatial heterogeneity with business traffic, age and race","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic and social challenges that continue to escalate. Meta-population epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health and shaping policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intra-county environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different sub-regions. To address this issue, we develop a new human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behavior. This new modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and human mobility, business foot-traffic, race & ethnicity, and age-group are then investigated. The results reveal that in a college town (Dane County) the most important heterogeneity is spatial, while in a large city area (Milwaukee County) racial-ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate on various reopening policies, which suggests that policymakers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and reopening.",Xiao Hou; Song Gao; Qin Li; Yuhao Kang; Nan Chen; Kaiping Chen; Jinmeng Rao; Jordan S.

99,Updating Herd Immunity Models for the U.S. in 2020: Implications for the COVID-19 Response,"Objectives. To understand what levels of herd immunity are required in the COVID-19 pandemic, given spatial population heterogeneity, to best inform policy and action. Methods. Using a network of counties in the United States connected by transit data we considered a set of coupled differential equations for susceptible-infectious-removed populations. We calculated the classical herd immunity level plus a version reflecting the heterogeneity of connections in the network by running the model forward in time until the epidemic completed. Results. Necessary levels of herd immunity vary greatly from county to county. A population weighted average for the United States is 47.5% compared to a classically estimated level of 77.1%. Conclusions. Common thinking argues that the nation needs to achieve at least 60% herd immunity to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterogeneity in contact structure and individual variation in infectivity, susceptibility, and resistance are key factors that reduce the disease-induced herd immunity levels to 34.2-47.5% in our models. Looking forward toward vaccination strategies, these results suggest we should consider not just who is vaccinated but where those vaccinations will do the most good.",Natalie Elizabeth Sheils; Gregory D Lyng; Ethan M Berke,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206706,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207100,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
100,PREDICTIONS FOR EUROPE FOR THE COVID-19 PANDEMICAFTER LOCKDOWN WAS LIFTED USING AN SIR MODEL,"I analyze a simplified SIR model developed from a paper written by Gyan Bhanot and Charles de Lisi in May of 2020 to find the successes and limitations of their predictions. In particular, I study the predicted cases and deaths fitted to data from March and its potential application to data in September. The data is observed to fit the model as predicted until around 150 days after December 31, 2019, after which many countries lift their lockdowns and begin to reopen. A plateau in cases followed by an increase approximately 1.5 months after is also observed. In terms of deaths, the data fits the shape of the model, but the model mostly underestimates the death toll after around 160 days. An analysis of the residuals is provided to locate the precise date of the departure of each country from its accepted data estimates and test each data point to its predicted value using a Z-test to determine whether each observation can fit the given model. The observed behavior is matched to policy measures taken in each country to attach an explanation to these observations.

101,"A Data-Informed Approach for Analysis, Validation, and Identification of COVID-19 Models","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an enormous amount of data, providing a unique opportunity for modeling and analysis. In this paper, we present a data-informed approach for building stochastic compartmental models that is grounded in the Markovian processes underlying these models. Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model -- susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) -- is not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions, implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization (H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V). Using the proposed model, we characterize delay distributions analytically and match model parameters to empirical quantities in the data to obtain a good model fit.

Outcomes were parent-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family life, concerns and trust in political measures. Results: Most families were concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic and lock-down measures, with major concerns directed towards the economic situation (>70%), the health of close-ones (37%), but less towards their own health (<10%). Many concerns, seeking information and approval of federal measures were more pronounced in the more affected region. Approval of lockdown measures and concerns about economic recession were related to regional differences and not significantly dependent on educational status or being personally affected by the disease.

103,Vulnerability and burden of all-cause mortality associated with particulate air pollution increased during COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide observed study in Italy,"Abstract Background: Limited evidence is available on the health effects of particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5m; PM10, < 10m; PM2.5-10, 2.5-10m) during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Italy. Objectives: To examine the associations between all-cause mortality and daily PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 in the pandemic period, and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily data regarding all-cause (stratified by age and gender), and PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak (March to May in 2020) and the same months in 2015-2019. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. Results: Overall, Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in 2020 pandemic period compared to same months of 2015-2019. Mortality effects were significant in lag 0-3 days for PM2.5, lag 0-2 for PM10, and lag 0-1 for PM2.5-10. Each 10 g/m3 increase in PM was associated much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during 2020 pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 [increased mortality rate: 7.24 % (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45 % (95%C: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10, 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10]. The counts and fractions of deaths attributable to PM were higher in 2020 than the normal periods for PM2.5 (attributable death counts: 20,062 in 2020 versus 3,927 per year in 2015-2019; attributable fractions: 10.2% versus 2.4%), PM10 (15,112 versus 3,999; 7.7% versus 2.5%), and PM2.5-10 (7,193 versus 2303; 3.7% versus 1.4%). Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic increased the vulnerability and excess cases of all-cause mortality associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM10 in Italy, despite a decline in air pollution level.

104,"An Agent Based Model for assessing spread and health systems burden for COVID-19 using a synthetic population in Telangana state, India","Objectives: To assess the transmission dynamics and the health systems burden of COVID-19 using an Agent Based Modeling (ABM) approach using a synthetic population. Study design: The study used a synthetic population with 31,738,240 agents representing 90.67 percent of the overall population of Telangana state, India as per 2011 Census of India. Lockdown phases as per Indian scenario considering the effects of post-lockdown, use of control measures and immunity on secondary infections were studied. District-level localized parameters were assigned to agents as local models prove to be much helpful for policymakers. Methods: The counts of people in different health states were measured separately for each district of Telangana. The model was run for 365 days and six scenarios with varying proportions of people using control measures (100%, 75% and 50%) and varying immunity periods of recovered patients (90 and 180 days). Results: Results indicate that the peak values were attained soon after the lockdown was lifted. The risk estimates indicate that protection factor values are higher when more proportion of people adopt control measures such as use of face mask and social distancing. Population Attributable Risk values measured longitudinally indicated higher values like 60.41% and 47.18% when 75 percent of people followed control measures during lockdowns. Conclusions: ABM approach helps to analyze grassroot details compared to compartmental models. Risk estimates allows the policymakers to determine the protection offered, its strength and percentage of population shielded by use of control measures.",Narassima MS; Guru Rajesh Jammy; Sankarshana A; Rashmi Pant; Anbuudayasankar SP; Lincoln Choudhury; Vijay Yeldandi; Shubham Singh; Denny John,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206391,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206177,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
105,"Scalable, effective, and rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated N95 respirators using germicidal ultra-violet C (UVC) irradiation device","Importance: Particulate respirators such as N95 masks are an essential component of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers. This study describes a rapid and effective UVC irradiation system that would facilitate the safe re-use of N95 respirators and provides supporting information for deploying UVC for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID19 pandemic. Objective: To assess the inactivation potential of the proposed UVC germicidal device as a function of time by using 3M 8211 - N95 particulate respirators inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Design: A germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose was developed and snippets (2.5cm2) of the 3M-N95 respirator were inoculated with 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 and were UV irradiated. Different exposure times were tested (0-164 seconds) by fixing the distance between the lamp (10 cm) and the mask while providing an exposure of at least 5.43 mWcm-2. Setting: The current work is broadly applicable for healthcare-settings, particularly during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Participants: Not applicable. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary measure of outcome was titration of infectious virus recovered from virus-inoculated respirator pieces after UVC exposure. Other measures included the method validation of the irradiation protocol, using lentiviruses (biosafety level-2 agent) and establishment of the germicidal UVC exposure protocol. Results: An average of 4.38x103 PFUml-1(SD 772.68) was recovered from untreated masks while 4.44x102 PFUml-1(SD 203.67), 4.00x102 PFUml-1(SD 115.47), 1.56x102 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) and 4.44x101 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) was recovered in exposures 2s,6s,18s and 54 seconds per side respectively. The germicidal device output and positioning was monitored and a minimum output of 5.43 mWcm-2 was maintained. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by plaque assays (minimal level of detection is 67 PFUml-1) on N95 respirator snippets when irradiated for 120s per side or longer suggesting 3.5 log reduction in 240 seconds of irradiation. Conclusions and Relevance: A scalable germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. UVC germicidal irradiation of N95 snippets inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 for 120s per side resulted in 100% (3.5 log in total) reduction of virus. These data support the reuse of N95 particle-filtrate apparatus upon irradiation with UVC and supports use of UVC-based decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID19 pandemic.",Raveen Rathnasinghe; Robert F Karlicek; Michael Schotsaert; Mattheos A Koffas; Brigitte Arduini; Sonia Jangra; Bowen Wang; Jason L.

106,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is found in conjunctival swabs and tears of COVID-19 patients. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues. Methods: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors. Findings: Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ~13% (17/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) disinfection. Interpretations: Our study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.",Onkar B Sawant; Sneha Singh; Robert Emery Wright III; Kayla M Jones; Michael S Titus; Eugene Dennis; Eric Hicks; Parag A Majmudar; Ashok Kumar; Shahzad I Mian,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206763,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20201574,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
107,"Incidence and Case-Fatality Ratio of COVID-19 infection in relation to Tobacco Smoking, Population Density and Age Demographics in the USA : could Particulate Matter derived from Tobacco Smoking act as a Vector for COVID-19 transmission?","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is known to increase the risk for bacterial and viral respiratory infections and this also applies to second-hand smoking. Smoking has been shown to increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and the consequent risk for intra-tracheal ventilation in smokers. Tobacco smoking exposes the user and nearby individuals to very high concentrations of particulate matter in a short period of time. Genes appertaining to COVID-19 have been found adherent to particulate matter. Particulate matter has been shown to travel beyond the social distance of 2 metres up to 10 metres. COVID-19 related mortality has been linked to elevated atmospheric levels of the particulate matter, PM2.5. The aim of the study was to observe the incidence of infection rate and case fatality ratios in the USA, comparing States with partial bans on tobacco smoking, to States with more restrictive smoking regulation, exploring a possible link between smoke-related particulate matter and COVID-19 transmission. METHODOLOGY: Two groups of USA States, differentiated by the degree of smoking legislative restrictions, had a number of variables compared. The incidence of COVID-19 infection, case-fatality ratio and testing frequency were obtained from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre. The degree of smoking bans in the USA States was obtained from the websites of the Nonsmokers Rights Foundation. The percentage of the State population which smokes was collected from the Centres of Disease Control database. Population density, Body Mass Index and population percentages of individuals 65+/75+years were obtained from databases concerning USA demographics. RESULTS: With the available data there was no significant difference in COVID-19 testing prevalence between the partial smoking ban group and the more restrictive regulated group. The incidence of COVID-19 infection in the States with limited bans on tobacco smoking was 2046/100,000 (sd+/-827) while the infection incidence in States with more restrictive rulings on tobacco smoking was 1660/100,000 (sd+/-686) (p<0.038). The population percentage of smokers in States with minor limitations to smoking was 18.3% (sd+/-3.28), while States with greater smoking restrictions had a smoking population percentage of 15.2% (sd+/-2.68) (p<0.0006). The two populations of both groups did not differ numerically (p<0.24) and numbered 157,820,000 in the partial smoking ban group and 161,439,356 in the more restrictive group. Population density correlated significantly with the case-fatality ratio (R=0.66 p<0.0001), as did the 75+year age group (R=0.29 p<0.04). Reflecting the possibility of trans-border transmission, the smoking status of adjacent partial smoking ban States may influence the COVID-19 incidence of bordering States (e.g. Utah) even if the smoking regulations of the latter were stricter than the former. Other factors that could impact the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA such as the State case-fatality ratio, population density, population percentage with elevated body mass index and the percentage of the state population aged 65years or above did not show any significant difference between both groups of States. CONCLUSION: States in the USA with high levels of tobacco smoking and limited regulation had significantly higher rates of COVID-19 infection incidences than States with greater smoking restrictions. Population density and the age group of 75+years, showed a positive significant correlation with the case-fatality ratio. Besides the adverse effects of tobacco smoking on pulmonary defences, it would be interesting to explore the possibility of infection transmission via coronavirus-laden particulate matter from exhaled fumes derived from tobacco smoking.

108,"Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Nepal: a multicenter, prospective cohort study","Introduction There is limited data on clinical course and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Nepal. Thus, it is imperative to characterize the features of this disease in the domestic context. Methodology We identified all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to five different hospitals in Nepal from June 15 to July 15, 2020. We collected epidemiological, socio-cultural and clinicopathologic data, and stratified the patients based on their symptom status. Results The study included 220 patients with an overall median age of 31.5 (25-37) years, and 181 (82.3%) were males. 159 (72.3%) were asymptomatic, and 163 (74.1%) were imported cases. Of 217 patients with the available data, 110 (50.7%) reported their annual household income less than 2000 US dollars, and 122 (56.2%) practiced Pranayama (yogic rhythmic breathing techniques) regularly. Eight patients (3.6%) required supplemental oxygen and two patients (0.9%) died. None of the patients who practiced Pranayama regularly required supplemental oxygen. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had greater proportion of females (31.1% vs. 12.6%, p=0.001), imported cases (85.2% vs. 69.8%, p=0.02), illiterates (26.8% vs. 12.1%, p=0.01), alcohol users (43.3% vs. 24.5%, p=0.01), patients feeling stigmatized by society (45.8% vs. 22.6%, p=0.001), and had higher platelet count (253 x 10^9/L vs. 185 x10^9/L, p=0.02). Conclusions Most cases were imported, asymptomatic young males, with very few deaths. Pranayama practice was associated with protection against severe COVID-19, but more data is needed to substantiate this.

109,Which factors should be included in triage? An online survey of the attitudes of the UK general public to pandemic triagedilemmas,"Objective: As cases of COVID-19 infections surge, concerns have renewed about intensive care units (ICU) being overwhelmed and the need for specific triage protocols over winter. This study aimed to help inform triage guidance by exploring the view of lay people about factors to include in triage decisions. Design, setting and participants: Online survey between 29th May and 22nd June 2020 based on hypothetical triage dilemmas. Participants recruited from existing market research panels, representative of the UK general population. Scenarios were presented in which a single ventilator is available, and two patients require ICU admission and ventilation. Patients differed in one of: chance of survival, life expectancy, age, expected length of treatment, disability, and degree of frailty. Respondents were given the option of choosing one patient to treat, or tossing a coin to decide. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-three participated. A majority of respondents prioritized patients who would have a higher chance of survival (72-93%), longer life expectancy (78-83%), required shorter duration of treatment (88-94%), were younger (71-79%), or had a lesser degree of frailty (60- 69% all p< .001). Where there was a small difference between two patients, a larger proportion elected to toss a coin to decide which patient to treat. A majority (58-86%) were prepared to withdraw treatment from a patient in intensive care who had a lower chance of survival than another patient currently presenting with COVID-19. Respondents also indicated a willingness to give higher priority to healthcare workers and to patients with young children. Conclusion: Members of the UK general public potentially support a broadly utilitarian approach to ICU triage in the face of overwhelming need. Survey respondents endorsed the relevance of patient factors currently included in triage guidance, but also factors not currently included.

110,Pathogenesis-based pre-exposure prophylaxis associated with low risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers at a designated Covid-19 hospital,"At present, no agents are known to be effective in preventing Covid-19. Based on current knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might be attenuated by directly maintaining innate pulmonary redox, metabolic and dilation functions using well-tolerated medications that are known to serve these functions, specifically, using a low dose aerosolized combination of glutathione, inosine and potassium. From June 1 to July 10, 2020, we conducted a low-intervention open-label single-centre study to evaluate safety and efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the aerosolized combination medications (ACM) on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in 99 healthcare workers (HCWs) at a hospital that was designated to treat Covid-19 patients. We also retrospectively compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the ACM users to that in 268 untreated HCWs at the same hospital. Eligible participants received an aerosolized combination of 21.3 mg/ml glutathione, 8.7 mg/ml inosine in 107 mM potassium solution for 14 days. The main outcome was the frequency of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, defined as individuals with positive genetic or immunological tests within 28 days of the study period. During the PrEP period, solicited adverse events occurred in five participants; all were mild and transient reactions. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2 ACM users (2%, 95% CI: 0.3% to 7.1%), which was significantly less than the incidence in 24 nonusers (9%, 95% CI: 5.8% to 13.0%; P = 0.02).

111,Highly Effective Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Conjugated Polymers and Oligomers,"The current Covid-19 Pandemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus has proven extremely difficult to prevent or control. Currently there are few treatment options and very few long-lasting disinfectants available to prevent the spread. While masks and protective clothing and social distancing may offer some protection, their use has not always halted or slowed the spread. Several vaccines are currently undergoing testing; however there is still a critical need to provide new methods for inactivating the virus before it can spread and infect humans. In the present study we examined the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by synthetic conjugated polymers and oligomers developed in our laboratories as antimicrobials for bacteria, fungi and non-enveloped viruses. Our results show that we can obtain highly effective light induced inactivation with several of these oligomers and polymers including irradiation with near-UV and visible light. With both the oligomers and polymers, we can reach several logs of inactivation with relatively short irradiation times.

112,Consideration for the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Objective: Worldwide countries are experiencing viral load in their population, leading to potential infectivity of asymptomatic COVID-19. Current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the role of asymptomatic infection worldwide reported in family-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers. Design: Online literature search (PubMed, Google Scholar, medRixv, and BioRixv) was accomplished using standard Boolean operators, studies published till 07th June 2020. Setting: Studies were included from case reports, short communication, and retrospective to cover sufficient asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission reported. Participants: Familial-clusters, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers. Results: We observed asymptomatic transmission among familial-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers with a proportion of 32% 37%, 26%, 6%, and 32%, respectively. This study observed an overall proportion of 31% (95%CI: 0.19-0.44) with heterogeneity of I2 (97.28%, p=<0.001) among all asymptomatic populations mentioned in this study. Among children and healthcare workers, this study showed no heterogeneity; to overcome the interpretation from a fixed model, the random effect model was also applied to estimate the average distribution across studies included in the meta-analysis. Conclusion: We found and suggest the rigorous epidemiological history, early isolation, social distancing, and increased quarantine period (at least 28 days) after screening asymptomatic cases as well as their close contacts for chest CT scan even after their negative nucleic acid testing to minimize the spread among the community. This systematic review and meta-analysis support asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission between person to person depending on the variation of virus incubation period among individuals.

Several layering technologies are being explored to mitigate indoor transmission in the hopes of re-opening business, schools and transportation systems. Here we coupled the water adsorptive and photocatalytic capacity of novel Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to demonstrate the capture and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2.

114,Epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses in hospitals in a Chinese city during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus first broke out in China in early 2020. The early symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. Therefore, during the epidemic, patients with similar symptoms will be tested for multiple pathogens at the same time. In order to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, China has taken many measures. Under this special situation, have the types and epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses changed? The nucleic acid test results of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as the antibody test results of 8 common respiratory viruses of Jinan Central Hospital were collected before and after the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and age distribution and time distribution characteristics were statisticed. Furthermore the epidemiological characteristics of this new virus before and after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was compared. In the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus nucleic acid test samples were large, and the positive rate of the three viruses was high. After that, the sample size and positive rate decreased significantly. No co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was found in our hospital. The sample size before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was larger than that after the outbreak, but the positive rate of the outbreak was lower than that after the outbreak. And the infection rate of children decreased in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. This is because since January 23, in order to prevent the spread of the new crown epidemic, my country has adopted measures such as wearing masks, not gathering together, and quarantining at home. This not only prevents the spread of the new crown virus, but also prevents the common respiratory tract.

115,An in-depth investigation of the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,"BACKGROUND In-depth investigations of the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed. METHOD In a phase I randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial involving 192 healthy adults 18-59 years of age, two injections of three different doses (50 EU, 100 EU and 150 EU) of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or the placebo were administered intramuscularly with a 2- or 4-week interval between the injections. The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated within 28 days. FINDING In this study, 191 subjects assigned to three doses groups or the placebo group completed the 28-day trial. There were 44 adverse reactions within the 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue, and no abnormal variations were observed in 48 cytokines in the serum samples of immunized subjects. The serum samples diluted from 1:32 to 1:4096 and incubated with the virus did not show antibody-dependent enhancement effects (ADEs) with regard to human natural killer cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. At day 14, the seroconversion rates had reached 92%, 100% and 96% with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.0, 54.5 and 37.1, and at day 28, the seroconversion rates had reached 80%, 96% and 92% with GMTs of 10.6, 15.4 and 19.6in 0, 14 and 0, 28 procedures, respectively. Seroconversion was associated with the synchronous upregulation of ELISA antibodies against the S protein, N protein and virion and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response.

116,Systematic discovery and functional interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA-host protein interactions during infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a pandemic with growing global mortality. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular pathways required for host infection and anti-viral immunity. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during active infection. Integration of this data with viral ChIRP-MS data from three other positive-sense RNA viruses defined pan-viral and SARS-CoV-2-specific host interactions. Functional interrogation of these factors with a genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the vast majority of viral RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and we identified known and novel anti-viral proteins that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Finally, our RNA-centric approach demonstrated a physical connection between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host mitochondria, which we validated with functional and electron microscopy data, providing new insights into a more general virus-specific protein logic for mitochondrial interactions. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform future studies to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, as well as nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.

117,Autoproteolytic Products of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein are Primed for Antibody Evasion and Virus Proliferation,"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most immunogenic of the structural proteins and plays essential roles in several stages of the virus lifecycle. It is comprised of two major structural domains: the RNA binding domain, which interacts with viral and host RNA, and the oligomerization domain which assembles to form the viral core. Here, we investigate the assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA, implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes autoproteolytic processing within the linker region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms. We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We used mass spectrometry to show that N binds to a monoclonal antibody raised against full-length N. No antibody interactions were detected for N proteoforms without C-terminal residues, therefore locating antigenic regions towards the C-terminus. We then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. We propose that the proteoforms generated via autoproteolysis evade antibody detection through removal of the antigenic C-terminus and facilitate interactions with structured RNA or cyclophilin thereby enabling the virus to proliferate.",Corinne A Lutomski; Tarick J El-Baba; Jani R Bolla; Carol V Robinson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20206052,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328112,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
118,GNS561 exhibits potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 through autophagy inhibition,"Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) has spread quickly worldwide, with more than 29 million cases and 920,000 deaths. Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack the autophagic process to allow their viral replication. One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Philippe Halfon; Eloine Bestion; Keivan Zandi; Julien Andreani; Jean-Pierre Baudoin; Bernard LA SCOLA; Jean-Louis Mege; Soraya Mezouar; Raymond F Schinazi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206177,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.327635,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
119,Multi-Clonal Live SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro Neutralization by Antibodies Isolated from Severe COVID-19 Convalescent Donors,"The interactions between antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and protective immunity. To understand the differences between antibody responses in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and VH3-53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike. Finally, we used combinations of nAbs targeting different immune-sites to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires revealed that the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs. We demonstrate that severe COVID-19 is associated with unique BCR signatures and multi-clonal neutralizing responses that are relatively frequent in the population.

120,"The strength of a NES motif in the nucleocapsid protein of human coronaviruses is related to genus, but not to pathogenic capacity","Seven members of the Coronaviridae family infect humans, but only three (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) cause severe disease with a high case fatality rate. Using in silico analyses (machine learning techniques and comparative genomics), several features associated to coronavirus pathogenicity have been recently proposed, including a potential increase in the strength of a predicted novel nuclear export signal (NES) motif in the nucleocapsid protein.

Here, we have used a well-established nuclear export assay to experimentally establish whether the recently proposed nucleocapsid NESs are capable of mediating nuclear export, and to evaluate if their activity correlates with coronavirus pathogenicity.

The six NES motifs tested were functional in our assay, but displayed wide differences in export activity. Importantly, these differences in NES strength were not related to strain pathogenicity. Rather, we found that the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus were markedly stronger than the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus.

We conclude that, while some of the genomic features recently identified in silico could be crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity, this does not appear to be the case of nucleocapsid NES activity, as it is more closely related to coronavirus genus than to pathogenic capacity.",Maria Sendino; Miren Josu Omaetxebarria; Jose A Rodriguez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328138,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328138,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
121,Structural basis for repurposing a 100-years-old drug suramin for treating COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic by non-stop infections of SARS-CoV-2 has continued to ravage many countries worldwide. Here we report the discovery of suramin, a 100-year-old drug, as a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. The 2.6 [A] cryo-EM structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites of suramin, with one site directly blocking the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clash with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells. These results provide a structural mechanism for the first non-nucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and a rationale for repurposing suramin for treating COVID-19.

122,Cytoplasmic short linear motifs in ACE2 and integrin beta3 link SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptors to endocytosis and autophagy,"The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enters the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Concomitantly, evidence is pointing to the involvement of additional host cell receptors, such as integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin {beta}3 contain a plethora of predicted binding motifs. Here, we confirm the functionality of some of these motifs through affinity measurements. The class I PDZ binding motif in the ACE2 cytoplasmic tail binds the first PDZ domain of the scaffold protein NHERF3. The clathrin-adaptor subunit AP2 2 interacts with an endocytic motif in the ACE2 with low affinity and the interaction is abolished by phosphorylation of Tyr781. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of integrin b3 contains a LC3-interacting region, and its interaction with ATG8 domains is enhanced by phosphorylation. Together, our data provides possible molecular links between host cell receptors and endocytosis and autophagy.

123,SARS-CoV-2 infection damages airway motile cilia and impairs mucociliary clearance,"Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads within the respiratory tract is important to define the parameters controlling the severity of COVID-19. We examined the functional and structural consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model. SARS-CoV-2 replication caused a transient decrease in epithelial barrier function and disruption of tight junctions, though viral particle crossing remained limited. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication led to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss and misorientation of remaining basal bodies. The motile cilia function was compromised, as measured in a mucociliary clearance assay. Epithelial defense mechanisms, including basal cell mobilization and interferon-lambda induction, ramped up only after the initiation of cilia damage. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters further demonstrated the loss of motile cilia in vivo. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma.",Rémy Robinot; Mathieu Hubert; Guilherme Dias de Melo; Françoise Lazarini; Timothée Bruel; Nikaïa Smith; Sylvain Levallois; Florence Larrous; Julien Fernandes; Stacy Gellenoncourt; Stéphane Rigaud; Olivier Gorgette; Catherine Thouvenot; Céline Trébeau; Guillaume Dumenil; Adeline Mallet; Samy Gobaa; Raphaël Etournay; Pierre-Marie Lledo; Marc Lecuit; Hervé Bourhy; Darragh Duffy; Vincent Michel; Olivier Schwartz; Lisa A Chakrabarti,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328336,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328369,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
124,Sub-second heat inactivation of coronavirus,"Heat treatment denatures viral proteins that comprise the virion, making virus incapable of infecting a host. Coronavirus (CoV) virions contain single-stranded RNA genomes with a lipid envelope and 4 proteins, 3 of which are associated with the lipid envelope and thus are thought to be easily denatured by heat or surfactant-type chemicals. Prior studies have shown that a temperature of as low as 75 {degrees}C and treatment duration of 15 min can effectively inactivate CoV. The applicability of a CoV heat inactivation method greatly depends on the length of time of a heat treatment and the temperature needed to inactivate the virus. With the goal of finding conditions where sub-second heat exposure of CoV can sufficiently inactivate CoV, we designed and developed a simple system that can measure sub-second heat inactivation of CoV. The system is composed of capillary stainless-steel tubing immersed in a temperature-controlled oil bath followed by an ice bath, through which virus solution can be flowed at various speeds. Flowing virus solution at different speeds, along with a real-time temperature monitoring system, allows the virus to be accurately exposed to a desired temperature for various durations of time. Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a beta-coronavirus, as a model system, we identified that 85.2 {degrees}C for 0.48 s exposure is sufficient to obtain > 5 Log10 reduction in viral titer (starting titer: 5 x 107 PFU/mL), and that when exposed to 83.4 {degrees}C for 0.95 s, the virus was completely inactivated (zero titer, > 6 Log10 reduction).

IMPORTANCEThree coronaviruses (CoVs) have now caused global outbreaks within the past 20 years, with the COVID19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 still ongoing. Methods that can rapidly inactivate viruses, especially CoVs, can play critical roles in ensuring public safety and safeguarding personal health. Heat treatment of viruses to inactive them can be an efficient and inexpensive method, with the potential to be incorporated into various human-occupied spaces. In this work, a simple system that can heat-treat viruses for extremely short period was developed and utilized to show that sub-second exposure of CoV to heat is sufficient to inactivate CoV. This opens up the possibility of developing instruments and methods of disinfecting CoV in diverse settings, including rapid liquid disinfection and airborne virus disinfection. The developed method can also be broadly utilized to assess heat sensitivity of viruses other viral pathogens of interest and develop sub-second rapid heat inactivation approaches.",Yuqian Jiang; Han Zhang; Jose A.

To investigate the statistical, rather than physiological basis of such warnings, this study examines correlations on a nation-by-nation basis between the statistical data concerning covid-19 fatalities among the populations of the ninety-nine countries with the greatest number of SARS-Cov-2 infections plus the statistics of potential co-morbidities that may influence the severity of the infections.

126,Proteolytic activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1/S2 site: a re-evaluation of furin cleavage,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2 site is known to activate the S protein for viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which expands viral tropism to lung cells. Here, we analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in related CoVs and offer thoughts on the implications of SARS-CoV-2s unique insert on its origin. We also utilized viral pseudoparticles to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential for plasma membrane entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for endosomal entry Vero E6 cells, a model cell culture line, and that other proteases in addition to furin are responsible for processing SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2.",Tiffany Tang; Javier A.

128,Design Of A Rapid And Reversible Fluorescence Assay To Detect COVID-19 And Other Pathogens,"We describe a rapid and reusable biophysical method to assay COVID-19. The method uses fluorescent sensors (i.e. molecular beacons) designed to detect COVID-19 RNA or any RNA of interest, concurrent with an internal control without the need for amplification. The molecular beacons are stem-loop structures in which a ~10 nucleotide loop region has the complementary sequence of a region of the target RNA, and a fluorophore and quencher are placed on the 5' and 3' ends of the stem. The energy of hybridization of the loop with its target is designed to be greater than the hybridization energy of the energy of the stem so that when the beacon encounters its target RNA, the structure opens resulting in dequenching of the fluorophore. Here, we designed a COVID-19 beacon that is completely quenched in its native form and undergoes a 50-fold increase in fluorescence when exposed to nanomolar amounts of synthetic viral oligonucleotide. No changes in intensity are seen when control RNA is added. A control beacon to a human GAPDH RNA, chosen for its high levels in saliva, behaved similar to the COVID-19 beacon. This increase in fluorescence with beacon opening can be completely reversed upon addition of single stranded DNA complementary to COVID-19 beacon loop region. Beacons can be attached to an insert matrix allowing their use in concentrated form and can be made from morphilino oligonucleotides that are resistant to RNases. We present an analysis of the parameters that will allow the development of test strips to detect virus in aerosol, body fluids and community waste.",Suzanne Scarlata; V Siddartha Yerramilli,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.327528,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20196113,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True

We tested whether pre-existing lymphocytopenia reported prior to any possible exposure to SARS-COV2 (from 2010 to 2019) was associated with fatality. Using all patients diagnosed on testing in a single regional laboratory, we identified 1137 subjects with PCR positive for SARS-COV2 and at least one available complete blood count from the decade prior to any possible exposure to the virus. Bivariate analysis indicated an association between pre-existing lymphocytopenia (defined as absolute lymphocyte count <0.9x109 /L) and fatality (18% versus 4%). Furthermore, a logistic regression model, accounting for both patient age and number of blood counts obtained, indicated the subjects with pre-existing lymphocytopenia were 1.4 times as likely to die. Because the absolute lymphocyte count is almost universally available and easily interpreted, this biomarker of the risk of fatality could be widely useful.",Richard Burack; Philip Rock; David Burtoon; Xueya Cai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.327528,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20200931,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True

We integrated 4,780 blood transcriptome profiles from patients infected with one of 16 viruses across 34 independent cohorts from 18 countries, and 71 scRNA-seq profiles of 264,224 immune cells across three independent cohorts. We found a myeloid cell-dominated conserved host response associated with severity. It showed increased hematopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells with increased severity. We identified four gene modules that delineate distinct trajectories associated with mild and severe outcomes, and show the interferon response was decoupled from protective host response during severe viral infection. These modules distinguished non-severe from severe viral infection with clinically useful accuracy.

131,Comparing biomarkers for COVID-19 disease with commonly associated preexisting conditions and complications.,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with certain preexisting health conditions and can cause respiratory failure along with other multi-organ injuries. However, the mechanism of these relationships is unclear, and prognostic biomarkers for the disease and its systemic complications are lacking. This study aims to examine the plasma protein profile of COVID-19 patients and evaluate overlapping protein modules with biomarkers of common comorbidities. Blood samples were collected from COVID-19 cases (n=307) and negative controls (n=78) among patients with acute respiratory distress. Proteins were measured by proximity extension assay utilizing next-generation sequencing technology. Its associations to COVID-19 disease characteristics were compared to that of preexisting conditions and established biomarkers for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and chronic kidney disease. Several proteins were differentially expressed in COVID-19, including multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma, CXCL10, and CCL7/MCP-3. Elevated IL-6 was associated with increased severity, while baseline IL1RL1/ST2 levels were associated with a worse prognosis. Network analysis identified several protein modules associated with COVID-19 disease characteristics overlapping with processes of preexisting hypertension and impaired kidney function. BNP and NTpro-BNP, markers for MI and stroke, increased with disease progression and were positively associated with severity. MMP12 was similarly elevated and has been previously linked to smoking and inflammation in emphysema, along with increased cardiovascular disease risk.

We used this model to project the burden of the disease in refugee camps characterized by peculiar demographic characteristics and a high level of deprivation, including lack of medical facilities and personnel, as well as limited possibility to implement containment and quarantine measures. Most of the parameters in our model were adapted from published literature but we used our own estimates of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$ as well as the lethality by age group and gender. We projected the burden in terms of number of infections, number of deaths and number of bed-days in hospitalization and intensive care, among others.

133,"Investigating the potential benefit that requiring travellers to self-isolate on arrival may have upon the reducing of case importations during international outbreaks of influenza, SARS, Ebola virus disease and COVID-19","With the advent of rapid international travel, disease can now spread between nations faster than ever. As such, when outbreaks occur in foreign states, pressure mounts to reduce the risk of importing cases to the home nation. In a previous paper, we developed a model to investigate the potential effectiveness of deploying screening at airports during outbreaks of influenza, SARS, and Ebola. We also applied the model to the current COVID-19 outbreak. This model simulated the testing of travellers (assumed not to be displaying symptoms prior to boarding their flight) as they arrived at their destination. The model showed that the reduction in risk of case importation that screening alone could deliver was minimal across most scenarios considered, with outputs indicating that screening alone could detect at most 46.4%, 12.9%, and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and Ebola respectively, while the model also reported a detection rate of 12.0% for COVID-19. In this paper, we present a brief modification to this model allowing us to assess the added impact that quarantining incoming travelers for various periods may have on reducing the risk of case importation. Primary results show that requiring all travellers to undergo 5 days of self-isolation on arrival, after which they are tested again, has the potential to increase rates of detection to 100%, 87.6%, 81.7% and 41.3% for travellers infected with influenza, SARS, COVID-19 and Ebola respectively.

It is unclear how many deaths might have been expected in the case of an early and effective response to the pandemic. We aim to provide a best-case estimate of COVID-19 deaths in the US by September 22nd using the experience of Germany as a benchmark. Our methods accommodate the differences in demographics between Germany and the US. We match cumulative incidence of COVID-19 deaths by age group in Germany to non-Hispanic whites in the US and project the implied number of deaths in this population and among the black and Hispanic populations under observed racial/ethnic disparities in cumulative COVID-19 mortality in the US. We estimate that if the US had been as successful as Germany in managing the pandemic we would have expected 22% of the deaths actually recorded. The number of deaths would have been lower by a further one-third if we could have eliminated racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. We conclude that almost 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in the US by September 22nd could have been avoided with an early and effective response producing similar age-specific death rates among non-Hispanic whites as in Germany.",Ruth Etzioni; Elan Markowitz; Ivor S Douglas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325415,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204586,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
135,Metabolic syndrome increases COVID-19-related mortality in the UK Biobank sample,"Previous studies link obesity and individual components of metabolic syndrome to increased hospitalisations and death rates of patients with COVID-19. Here, in two overlapping samples of over 1,000 individuals from the UK Biobank we investigate whether metabolic syndrome, and its constituent components, increased waist circumference, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and systemic inflammation, are related to increased COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Using logistic regression and controlling for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, age, sex or ethnicity, we find that individuals with pre-existing metabolic syndrome (measured on average eleven years prior to 2020) have an increased risk for COVID-19-related death (odds ratio 1.67). We also find that specific factors contributing to increased mortality are serum glucose levels, systolic blood pressure and waist circumference.",Filip Morys; Alain Dagher,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325415,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205716,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
136,In vitro efficacy of Artemisinin-based treatments against SARS-CoV-2,"Effective and affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are needed. We report in vitro efficacy of Artemisia annua extracts as well as artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether against SARS-CoV-2. The latter two are approved active pharmaceutical ingredients of anti-malarial drugs.

Proof-of-concept for prophylactic efficacy of the extracts was obtained using a plaque-reduction assay in VeroE6 cells. Subsequent concentration-response studies using a high-throughput antiviral assay, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed that pretreatment and treatment with extracts, artemisinin, and artesunate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. In treatment assays, artesunate (50% effective concentration (EC50): 7 g/mL) was more potent than the tested plant extracts (128-260 g/mL) or artemisinin (151 g/mL) and artemether (>179 g/mL), while generally EC50 in pretreatment assays were slightly higher. The selectivity index (SI), calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, was highest for artemisinin (54), and roughly equal for the extracts (5-10), artesunate (6) and artemether (<7). Similar results were obtained in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. Peak plasma concentrations of artesunate exceeding EC50 values can be achieved.

137,A national study of self-reported COVID symptoms during the first viral wave in Canada,"Importance: Accurate understanding of COVID pandemic during the first viral wave in Canada could help prepare for future epidemic waves. Objective: To track the early course of the pandemic by examining self-reported COVID symptoms over time before testing became widely available. Design: Adults from the nationally representative Angus Reid Forum were randomly invited to complete an online survey in May/June 2020. The study is a part of the Action to Beat Coronavirus antibody testing study. Setting: A 20-item internet survey. Participants: 14,408 adults age 18 years of age. Exposures: The months that respondents and any household members first experienced various respiratory, neurological, sleep, skin or gastric symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measure: COVID symptom-positive, defined as fever (or fever with hallucinations) plus at least one of difficulty breathing, a dry severe cough, loss of smell or COVID toe. Results: In total, 14,408 panel members (48% male and 52% female) completed the survey. Despite overrepresentation of higher levels of education, the prevalence of obesity, smoking, diabetes and hypertension were similar to national census and health surveys. A total of 811 (5.6%) were COVID symptom-positive; highest rates were at ages 18-44 years (8.3% among), declining at older ages. Females had higher odds of reporting COVID symptoms (OR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.11-1.56) as did visible minorities (OR = 1.74, 1.29-2.35). COVID symptom positivity for respondents and their household members peaked in March (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.59-2.34 compared to earlier months). Conclusions and Relevance: This study enhances our current understanding of the progression of the COVID epidemic in Canada, with few laboratory-confirmed cases in January and February, peaking in April.

139,Validation of self-collected buccal swab and saliva as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19,"Background: Effective management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires large-scale testing. Collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) by healthcare workers (HCW) is currently used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of transmission to HCWs. Self-administered saliva and buccal swabs are convenient, painless and safe alternative sample collection methods. Methods: A cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 participants who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS within the past 7 days. A self-collected saliva and buccal swab and a HCW-collected NPS were obtained. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for saliva and buccal swabs, as compared with NPS. Results: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7% and OA 69.0%. The buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100% and OA 73.8%. Presence of symptoms improved diagnostic accuracy. There was no statistically significant association between CT values and duration of symptom onset within the first 12 days of symptoms for all three modalities. Conclusion: Self-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs have only moderate agreement with HCW-collected NPS swabs. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives. This combined strategy minimizes discomfort and reduces the risk of spread to the community and HCWs.",Chee Wai Ku; Shivani Durai; Jacqueline Q T Kwan; See Ling Loy; Christina Erwin; Karrie K K Ko; Xiang Wen Ng; Lynette Oon; Koh Cheng Thoon; Shirin Kalimuddin; Jerry KY Chan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20200931,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205278,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True

To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age [&ge;] 18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to 5 non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. Results: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18%) were hospitalized, 107 (4%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3%) died. The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 0.99 (95% Confidence Internal 0.80, 1.22) for hospitalization, 0.69 (95% Confidence Internal 0.36, 1.29) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.30 (95% Confidence Internal 0.11, 0.80) for death.

141,Early transfusion of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients with high titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG convalescent plasma confirms a signal of significantly decreased mortality,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains a global threat with few proven efficacious treatments. Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 disease has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity-score matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality. We here present results from 60-day follow up of our cohort of 351 transfused hospitalized patients. Prospective determination of ELISA anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recently FDA-required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma. In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.",Eric Salazar; Paul A.

142,Evaluating the Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines,"A large number of studies are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines against novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Most Phase 3 trials have adopted virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease as the primary efficacy endpoint, although laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest. In addition, it is important to evaluate the effect of vaccination on disease severity. To provide a full picture of vaccine efficacy and make efficient use of available data, we propose using SARS- CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 as dual or triple primary endpoints. We demonstrate the advantages of this strategy through realistic simulation studies.

143,Impact of pathogen reduction technologies on immunological propertiesof the COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"Background and Objectives In the absence of a vaccine or specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 convalescent plasma became one of the experimental treatment options in many countries. Aim of this study was to assess the impact of different pathogen reduction technologies on the immunological properties of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Materials and Methods In our experiment 140 doses of plasma collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction with one of three different methods: methylene blue (M), riboflavin (R), and amotosalen (A). To conduct a paired two-sample comparison each plasma dose was divided into 2 that were treated by one of these technologies. The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N- proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction. Results All methods reduced NtAbs titers significantly but not at the same grade: among units with the initial titre 80 or above, 81% of units had unchanged titres while 19% decreased by 1 step after methylene blue; 60% unchanged and 40% - decreased by 1 step after amotosalen; 43% unchanged, 67% a one-step decrease and 6% - a two-step decrease after riboflavin. Pairwise two-sample comparisons (M vs A, M vs R and A vs R) revealed the most prominent and statistically significant decrease in all studied parameters (except anti-RBD) following pathogen reduction with riboflavin.

Researchers have invested tremendous efforts to develop vaccines or effective drug therapy but have not yet been fruitful. Hence, we planned to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to supplement the readers with comprehensive data and credible information on the safety and efficacyof essential pharmacotherapy during the pharmacological management of COVID-19. Methods: Theprotocol will be designed based on the updated PRISMA-P 2015 guidelines. An elaborate search of electronic databases such as PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, Medrxiv and other potential databases for articles published during January 2020 to 10 October 2020 is planned to be conducted. Following this,randomized control trials published in English language that assess the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy versusplacebo or standard of care or usual care will be evaluated for inclusion. The primary outcomes will include time to clinical recovery and the probability for the negative conversion of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes will quantifythe proportion of patients relieved of symptoms, the all-cause mortality, morbidity, detection of viral RNA, time needed to achieve a negative viral load, ordinal scale changes, ventilatorand oxygen requirements,length of hospital stayand the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events.RevMan V.5.3 computer software packages will be utilised to conduct an accurate statistical analysis of the study.

146,Combined metabolic cofactor supplementation accelerates recovery in mild-to-moderate COVID-19,"BACKGROUND The characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak and high fatality rate of COVID-19 infection have attracted the attention of scientists due to the strong interactions between components of metabolic syndrome, metabolic abnormalities, and viral pathobiology of COVID-19. Combined metabolic cofactors supplementation (CMCS) consisting of L-serine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and L-carnitine tartrate is being studied for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a placebo-controlled, phase-2 clinical trial involving ambulatory COVID-19 patients. A total of 100 patients were randomly assigned on a 3:1 basis to hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS or hydroxychloroquine plus placebo. The total treatment period for the hydroxychloroquine was 5 days, and for the CMCS/placebo was 14 days. Clinical status was evaluated daily by phone, using a binomial scale for subject reported presence or absence for multiple COVID-19 related symptoms. Plasma samples for clinical chemistry analyses were collected on day 0 and day 14. RESULTS A total of 93 patients completed the trial. The combination of CMCS and hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced the average complete recovery time compared with hydroxychloroquine and placebo (6.6 days vs 9.3 days, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in ALT, AST and LDH levels on day 14 compared to day 0 in the hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS group. The adverse effects were uncommon and self-limiting. CONCLUSIONS In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, CMCS resulted in a significant reduction in recovery time and liver enzymes associated with hepatic function compared to placebo.

147,"An improved and readily available version of Bst DNA Polymerase for LAMP, and applications to COVID-19 diagnostics","Despite the fact that strand-displacing activity is of great utility for a variety of applications, including isothermal amplification assays, there are relatively few strand-displacing DNA polymerases. In particular, the thermotolerant DNA polymerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (previously Bacillus stearothermophilus), Bst DNA polymerase (Bst DNAP), is used in a variety of assays, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification. However, despite its wide use, its properties remain open to improvement, as has been demonstrated by a variety of engineering efforts, including the identification of point mutations that impact its robustness, strand-displacement capabilities, and nascent reverse transcriptase activity. Interestingly, a strategy that has been commonly used to alter the capabilities of DNA polymerases, the addition of additional DNA- or RNA-binding domains, has yet to be applied to Bst DNAP. To this end, we now show that by adding fusion domains the performance of Bst DNAP in isothermal amplification assays, including its nascent RT activity, can be greatly improved.

148,Testing mobile air purifiers in a school classroom: Reducing the airborne transmission risk for SARS-CoV-2,"Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through virus-containing aerosol particles has been established as an important pathway for Covid-19 infection. Suitable measures to prevent such infections are imperative, especially in situations when a high number of persons convene in closed rooms. Here we tested the efficiency and practicability of operating four air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters in a high school classroom while regular classes were taking place. We monitored the aerosol number concentration for particles > 3 nm at two locations in the room, the aerosol size distribution in the range from 10 nm to 10 m, PM10 and CO2 concentration. For comparison, we performed similar measurements in a neighboring classroom without purifiers. In times when classes were conducted with windows and door closed, the aerosol concentration was reduced by more than 90 % within less than 30 minutes when running the purifiers (air exchange rate 5.5 h-1). The reduction was homogeneous throughout the room and for all particle sizes. The measurements are supplemented by a calculation estimating the maximum concentration levels of virus-containing aerosol from a highly contagious person speaking in a closed room with and without air purifiers. Measurements and calculation demonstrate that air purifiers represent a well suited measure to reduce the risks of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 substantially. Staying for two hours in a closed room with a super infective person, we estimate that the inhaled dose is reduced by a factor of six when using air purifiers with a total air exchange rate of 5.7 h-1.",Joachim Curtius; Manuel Granzin; Jann Schrod,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204586,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205633,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
149,Extremely preterm infant admissions within the SafeBoosC-III consortium during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Objective: To evaluate if the number of admitted extremely preterm (EP) infants (born before 28weeks of gestational age) has changed in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of the SafeBoosC-III consortium during the global lockdown when compared to the corresponding time period in 2019. Design: This is a retrospective, observational study. Forty-six out of 79 NICUs (58%) from 17 countries participated. Principal investigators were asked to report the following information: 1) Total number of EP infant admissions to their NICU in the three months where the lockdown restrictions were most rigorous during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) Similar EP infant admissions in the corresponding three months of 2019, 3) the level of local restrictions during the lockdown period and 4) the local impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the everyday life of a pregnant woman. Results: There was no significant difference between the number of EP infant admissions during the three most rigorous lockdown months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the corresponding three months in 2019 (n=428 versus n=457 respectively, p=0.33). There were no significant changes within individual geographic regions and no significant association between the level of lockdown restrictions and change in the number of EP infant admissions (p=0.334).

150,Willingness of Nigerian residents to disclose COVID-19 symptoms and take COVID-19 test,"Background: An understanding of willingness of people to disclose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and take the COVID-19 test will help provide important insight for motivators towards the self-surveillance and testing strategies recommended by the World Health Organization to curtail and halt the transmission of COVID-19. Objectives: This study assessed willingness to disclose symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and willingness to take COVID-19 test as well as their predictors. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 524 Nigerian adults, aged [&ge;] 18 years, residing in Nigeria and who had not taken the COVID-19 test was conducted. Information on willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms, take COVID-19 test and possible predictors were collected. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics evaluated at 5% significance level. Results: Mean age of respondents was 35.8 (S.D: 10.7) years and 57.0% were males. Majority (85.8% and 86.2% respectively) were willing to disclose COVID-19 symptoms and take COVID-19 test. Self-risk perception of contracting COVID-19 predicted both willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=3.236; 95%CI=1.836-5.704) and take COVID-19 test (aOR=3.174; 95%CI=1.570-6.419). Willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=13.060; 95%CI= 6.253-27.276), knowledge of someone who had taken the test (aOR= 4.106; 95%CI= 1.179-14.299) and thought that it was important for people to know their COVID-19 status (aOR=3.123; 95%CI= 1.516-6.434) also predicted willingness to take COVID-19 test. Conclusion: Nigerians are willing to disclose symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and take the COVID-19 test. Investment in interventions developed based on the predicting factors will help speed up the finding and testing of suspected COVID-19 cases.",Victoria Oluwabunmi Oladoyin; Oluyemi Adewole Okunlola; Oluwaseyi Kikelomo Israel; Demilade Olusola Ibirongbe; Joy Atonirehonmon Osifo; Taiwo Akinyode Obembe; Paulinus Kunle Omode; Olugbenga Olusegun Osunmakinwa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205914,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205914,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
151,Pooled Saliva Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Testing,"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or mid-turbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (N=380) and in the emergency department (ED) (N=69). The percent positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% CI: 65.8% - 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI: 98.7% - 100%), respectively. The sensitivity increased to 90.0% (95% CI: 74.4% - 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (Cycle threshold (Ct) for the NP <=34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms: bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche COBAS 6800. The median loss of signal upon pooling was 2-4 Ct values across the platforms. The sensitivity of detecting a positive specimen in a pool compared with testing individually was 100%, 93%, and 95% for CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR, Panther Fusion(R) SARS-CoV-2 assay, and cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 test respectively, with decreased sample detection trending with lower viral load. We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport media for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.",Bidisha Barat; Sanchita Das; Valeria De Giorgi; David K.

152,"COVID-19 Viral Loads, Environment, Ventilation, Masks, Exposure Time, And Severity : A Pragmatic Guide Of Estimates","This study seeks to better understand how indoor ventilation improvements could offer significant protection against aerosol transmission of COVID-19. It compares the effects of infected person[s] shedding virus in multiple indoor and outdoor settings and estimates resulting infection potential at multiple severities based on exposure time. Key information needed to perform this aerosolized viral load exposure time estimation analysis and clinical severity likelihood interpretation includes measured amounts of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients and known Influenza A challenge escalation doses; both of which are obtained from peer-reviewed and published studies. Information from ASHRAE Office Ventilation standards and an Outdoor Air Exchange model are also utilized. While these estimations have unknown error margins and cannot be considered authoritative, they may have utility in comparing various environments and relative risk factors. The estimates in this study also present an initial framework and specific quantitative examples for better understanding of the effects of ventilation on aerosolized transmission, and the immunology related to graduated challenge doses, and the potential for low-level viral load exposure to result in some level of immunity without symptoms of illness (asymptomatic infection). This study finds that outdoor environments reduce transmission risk by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to common indoor environments, that improved ventilation can reduce risk within indoor environments, and suggests that environments with diluted viral loads improves the probability of developing protective immunity while limiting symptoms and illness. This study s multiple examples of specific quantitative viral load exposure levels versus symptoms and immune response, and simplified descriptions of the quantitative differences between protective vs pathologic exposure levels, could provide an intriguing inductive learning tool that protectively guides individual behavior within the general public.",David E.

153,Motif Analysis in k-mer Networks: An Approach towards Understanding SARS-CoV-2 Geographical Shifts,"With an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available day by day, new genomic information is getting revealed to us. As SARS-CoV-2 sequences highlight wide changes across the samples, we aim to explore whether these changes reveal the geographical origin of the corresponding samples. The k-mer distributions, denoting normalized frequency counts of all possible combinations of nucleotide of size upto k, are often helpful to explore sequence level patterns. Given the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are highly imbalanced by its geographical origin (relatively with a higher number samples collected from the USA), we observe that with proper under-sampling k-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences predict its geographical origin with more than 90% accuracy. The experiments are performed on the samples collected from six countries with maximum number of sequences available till July 07, 2020. This comprises SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Australia, USA, China, India, Greece and France. Moreover, we demonstrate that the changes of genomic sequences characterize the continents as a whole. We also highlight that the network motifs present in the sequence similarity networks have a significant difference across the said countries. This, as a whole, is capable of predicting the geographical shift of SARS-CoV-2.",Sourav Biswas; Suparna Saha; Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay; Malay Bhattacharyya,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20204859,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325662,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,False
154,Religious affiliation and the risk of COVID 19 related mortality; a retrospective analysis of variation in pre and post lockdown risk by religious group in England and Wales.,"Background COVID 19 mortality risk is associated with demographic and behavioural factors; furthermore religious gatherings have been linked with the spread of COVID. We sought to understand the variation in the risk of COVID 19 related death across religious groups in the UK both before and after lockdown. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of usual residents in England and Wales enumerated at the 2011 Census (n = 48,422,583), for risk of death involving COVID-19 using linked death certificates. Cox regression models were estimated to compare risks between religious groups. Time dependent religion coefficients were added to the model allowing hazard ratios (HRs) pre and post lockdown period to be estimated separately. Results Compared to Christians all religious groups had an elevated risk of death involving COVID-19; the largest age adjusted HRs were for Muslim and Jewish males at 2.5 (95% confidence interval 2.3-2.7) and 2.1 (1.9-2.5), respectively. The corresponding HRs for Muslim and Jewish females were 1.9 (1.7-2.1) and 1.5 (1.7-2.1). The difference in risk between groups contracted after lockdown. Those who affiliated with no religion had the lowest risk of COVID 19 related death before and after lockdown. Conclusion The majority of the variation in COVID 19 mortality risk was explained by controlling for socio demographic and geographic determinants; however, Jews remained at a higher risk of death compared to all other groups. Lockdown measures were associated with reduced differences in COVID 19 mortality rates between religious groups, further research is required to understand the causal mechanisms.",Charlotte Gaughan; Daniel Ayoubkhani; Vahe Nafilyan; Peter Goldblatt; Chris White; Karen Tingay; Neil Bannister,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206110,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20204495,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
155,RT qLAMP--Direct Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Raw Sewage,"The project purpose was to examine ability of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage, directly, using no preliminary sample processing for virus concentration and RNA extraction. An objective was to take advantage of extensive recently published work to facilitate process development, principally primer selection, and to use readily available off the shelf materials with conventional lab procedure and equipment. Well-developed and referenced primers for ORF1a, E, and N-gene targets were selected and applied, using commercially available synthetic RNA standards, and raw sewage from a local wastewater agency serving 650,000. County health department monitoring provided current COVID-19 data. Testing defined performance characteristics for each primer set, with significant differences between them. Specific amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed using each of the primer sets, with E-gene and N-gene primers most effective. Positive analysis results from all raw sewage samples corresponded to calculated concentrations of virus in 5-10 L raw sewage aliquots for 25 L reactions. Results show that even at low reported case rates e.g. 1-10/100,000, SARS-CoV-2 is present in raw sewage at > 1-5/ L, permitting direct LAMP-based detection. Use of RT qLAMP will facilitate wastewater-based epidemiology as an important component for COVID-19 control.",Jerry E Ongerth; Richard E Danielson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206110,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205492,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
156,COVID-19-lockdown impact and vulnerability factors on cognitive functioning and mental health,"The COVID-19 outbreak and its associated restrictive measures, such as lockdown, exposed most individuals to an unprecedented stressful situation, increasing worldwide the prevalence of mental health disorders. Here, we aimed at exploring for the first time the effect of COVID-19-lockdown on subjective cognitive functioning as well as mental health, in terms of its prevalence and clinical severity. In addition, potential risk factors characterizing more vulnerable groups were investigated. A nationwide cross-sectional online-survey was conducted during the final phase of lockdown in Italy (after 7-10 weeks of home confinement), leading to a sample of 1215 participants. We found lockdown can have a severe impact on subjective cognitive functioning, along with mental health disorders. Namely, under restrictions, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in everyday tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions; while no changes in language abilities were reported. Conversely, a paradoxical effect was observed in memory domain, with people experiencing a reduction of memory failures compared to pre-lockdown times. Further, higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders and of other psychological issues (involving sleep, appetite, libido and hypochondria) were observed - with a prevalence of mild-to-severe depression and anxiety rising up to 32.30% and 35.72% respectively, under restrictions. Being female, young (<45 years), repeatedly exposed to COVID-19-media, working from home or being unemployed were identified as relevant risk factors for experiencing cognitive worsening and mental health disorders, related to the COVID-19 lockdown. Being resident in high infection-prevalence areas was related to higher level of depression and health anxiety. As lockdown and quarantine measures could be reimposed, health officials have to carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decision-making process, to develop an effective global and long-term response to the mental health challenges of this pandemic as well as to implement psychological interventions and specific guidelines, particularly about COVID-19-media exposure.",Eleonora Fiorenzato; Silvia Zabberoni; Alberto Costa; Giorgia Cona,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325662,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205237,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
157,The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Uptake of Influenza Vaccine: A UK-Wide Observational Study,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on acceptance of flu vaccination in the 2020-21 season, including for those newly eligible for the UK National Health Service (NHS) free vaccination programme, extended this year to include an estimated 32.4 million (48.8%) of the UK population. Knowing intended uptake is essential to inform supply and steer public health messaging to maximise vaccination given the combined threats of both flu and Covid-19 - the unknown impact of which on both attitudes and the need for mass uptake yet again create the threat of ill-informed planning resulting in failure to meet necessary public health demand. Methods: An online questionnaire posing question items on influenza vaccination was administered to registrants of the Care Information Exchange (CIE), the NHS's largest patient electronic personal health record. This was part of a longitudinal study initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. This analysis was limited to those who, in line with established NHS criteria, were previously or newly eligible but had not routinely received seasonal influenza vaccination in the past. Groups were stratified by response (yes/no) to intending to receive flu vaccination in 2020-21: Group 1.) Previously eligible now responding ""yes"", 2.) Previously eligible still responding ""no"", 3.) Newly eligible responding ""yes"", and 4.) Newly eligible responding ""no"". Within these groups, response by health worker status and each group's inclination to vaccinate school age children was also measured. Summary statistics were reported alongside univariate and multivariable regression. Lastly, a network analysis visualised the frequency and co-occurrence of reasons qualifying response for or against influenza vaccination in 2020/21. Findings: Among 6,641 respondents, 4,040 (61.1%) had previously routinely received the flu vaccination. 1,624 (24.5%) had been either previously eligible but not vaccinated (945, 58.2%) or newly eligible (679, 41.8%). Among the previously eligible participants who had not routinely received influenza vaccination 536 (56.7%) responded they would in 2020-21, increasing the vaccination rate in the entire previously eligible cohort from 79.6% to 91.2%, and 466 (68.6%) in the newly eligible. Multivariable logistic regression resulted in few substantial changes to effect estimates, with the exception of age, for which all estimates showed a stronger association with intention to receive the flu vaccine. In those who became newly eligible to receive the flu vaccine, there was an association between intention to receive the flu vaccine and increased age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12), IMD quintile, and considering oneself at high risk from Covid-19 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.70). Network analysis showed the most frequent themes for previously eligible unvaccinated and newly eligible participants accepting vaccination in 2020/21 were: ""precaution for myself"" (41.2% and 46.1%) and ""Covid-19"" (27.4% and 27.1%), where the former was qualified by the latter in 36% and 29.1% of responses. Among the previously and newly eligible not intending to receive vaccination in 2020/21, misinformed themes of ""makes me unwell"", ""gives me flu"" and ""vaccine doesn't work"" were present across 37.4% and 21.9% of responses, respectively. Among participants with school age children, of those previously eligible who now intend to be vaccinated themselves, 82.5% also intend to vaccinate their children in 2020/21 compared to 25.8% of those who would not accept the influenza vaccine for themselves. Among the newly eligible respondents this was 82.1% and 43.5%, respectively. 49.9% of the previously unvaccinated healthcare workers would continue to decline the vaccine in 2020/21. Interpretation: In this UK-wide observational study, Covid-19 has increased acceptance of flu vaccination in 2020/21 from 79.6% to 91.2% in those previously eligible, and for the 69% of those newly eligible. This high anticipated vaccination rate (to 26 million (80%) of the UK population) requires appropriate planning, but can be further increased with effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions about flu vaccination, which may also help in preparation for future Covid-19 vaccination. It remains of concern that 50% of healthcare professionals who refused it previously still do not intend to have the flu vaccine.",Patrik Bachtiger; Alex Adamson; Ji-Jian Chow; Rupa Sisodia; Jennifer K Quint; Nicholas S Peters,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325662,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205385,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
158,Racial-ethnic disparities in case fatality ratio narrowed after age standardization: A call for race-ethnicity-specific age distributions in State COVID-19 data,"Importance: COVID-19 racial disparities have gained significant attention yet little is known about how age distributions obscure racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 case fatality ratios (CFR). Objective: We filled this gap by assessing relevant data availability and quality across states, and in states with available data, investigating how racial-ethnic disparities in CFR changed after age adjustment. Design/Setting/Participants/Exposure: We conducted a landscape analysis as of July 1st, 2020 and developed a grading system to assess COVID-19 case and death data by age and race in 50 states and DC. In states where age- and race-specific data were available, we applied direct age standardization to compare CFR across race-ethnicities. We developed an online dashboard to automatically and continuously update our results. Main Outcome and Measure: Our main outcome was CFR (deaths per 100 confirmed cases). We examined CFR by age and race-ethnicities. Results: We found substantial variations in disaggregating and reporting case and death data across states. Only three states, California, Illinois and Ohio, had sufficient age- and race-ethnicity-disaggregation to allow the investigation of racial-ethnic disparities in CFR while controlling for age. In total, we analyzed 391,991confirmed cases and 17,612 confirmed deaths. The crude CFRs varied from, e.g. 7.35% among Non-Hispanic (NH) White population to 1.39% among Hispanic population in Ohio. After age standardization, racial-ethnic differences in CFR narrowed, e.g. from 5.28% among NH White population to 3.79% among NH Asian population in Ohio, or an over one-fold difference. In addition, the ranking of race-ethnic-specific CFRs changed after age standardization. NH White population had the leading crude CFRs whereas NH Black and NH Asian population had the leading and second leading age-adjusted CFRs respectively in two of the three states. Hispanic populations age-adjusted CFR were substantially higher than the crude. Sensitivity analysis did not change these results qualitatively. Conclusions and Relevance: The availability and quality of age- and race-ethnic-specific COVID-19 case and death data varied greatly across states. Age distributions in confirmed cases obscured racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 CFR. Age standardization narrows racial-ethnic disparities and changes ranking. Public COVID-19 data availability, quality, and harmonization need improvement to address racial disparities in this pandemic.",Ishaan Pathak; Yoonjoung Choi; Dazhi Jiao; Diana Yeung; Li Liu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20204495,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205377,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
159,COVID-19 Classification of X-ray Images Using Deep Neural Networks,"In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is playing an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19. Machine learning solutions have been shown to be useful for X-ray analysis and classification in a range of medical contexts. The purpose of this study is to create and evaluate a machine learning model for diagnosis of COVID-19, and to provide a tool for searching for similar patients according to their X-ray scans. In this retrospective study, a classifier was built using a pre-trained deep learning model (ReNet50) and enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation to detect COVID-19 in frontal CXR images collected between January 2018 and July 2020 in four hospitals in Israel. A nearest-neighbors algorithm was implemented based on the network results that identifies the images most similar to a given image. The model was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and of the precision-recall (P-R) curve. The dataset sourced for this study includes 2362 CXRs, balanced for positive and negative COVID-19, from 1384 patients (63 +/- 18 years, 552 men). Our model achieved 89.7% (314/350) accuracy and 87.1% (156/179) sensitivity in classification of COVID-19 on a test dataset comprising 15% (350 of 2326) of the original data, with AUC of ROC 0.95 and AUC of the P-R curve 0.94.

Whether LT recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 compared to the general population is controversial. Here we report the first results of a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in a large LT recipient cohort. Taking into account known risk factors, LT recipients a priori represented a high-risk cohort for severe COVID-19 with 101/219 (46.1 %) presenting with more than 2 risk factors for severe COVID-19. Out of 219 LT recipients 8 (3.7%) were either tested positive for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG. 5/8 (62.5 %) did not show any clinical signs of infection, 3/8 (37.5%) had self-limited disease, none required hospitalization for COVID-19. 5/8 (67.5%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients showed high utilization of the healthcare system. 2/8 (25 %) had known exposure to infected health care personal. A majority of 65.4 % often or always avoided outside family social contacts. Face masks were commonly worn by all patients.

Healthcare system, financial growth, industrial development and educational programme are stunted. Inevitably, professional training and education are affected which include the medical training of medical interns. Methods This is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis. Results Medical interns feel that they lack clinical skills (p = 0.005) and need more exposure in surgical operations (p =0.029). Some are satisfied with the introduction of triage (p = 0.024), online teaching (p = 0.005) and bedside teaching (p=0.023). Most of them think they are fit and ready to handle the pandemic (p = 0.012 and 0.025 respectively) except first year medical interns (p = 0.029). Some feel like their time are wasted (p <0.05) as they are involved in many non-clinical activities (p = 0.003).

162,"Development, evaluation, and validation of machine learning models for COVID-19 detection based on routine blood tests","Background: The rRT PCR test, the current gold standard for the detection of coronavirus disease (COVID19), presents with known shortcomings, such as long turnaround time, potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates around 15/20%, and expensive equipment. The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods: Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two subdatasets (COVID specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal external and external validation. Results: We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96. Conclusions: ML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID19 positive patients.

163,GABA administration prevents severe illness and death following coronavirus infection in mice,"There is an urgent need for new treatments to prevent and ameliorate severe illness and death induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 causes pneumonitis in mice which shares many pathological characteristics with human SARS-CoV infection. Previous studies have shown that the amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether oral treatment with GABA could modulate the MHV-1 induced pneumonitis in susceptible A/J mice. As expected, MHV-1-inoculated control mice became severely ill (as measured by weight loss, clinical score, and the ratio of lung weight to body weight) and >60% of them succumbed to the infection. In contrast, mice that received GABA immediately after MHV-1 inoculation became only mildly ill and all of them recovered. When GABA treatment was initiated after the appearance of illness (3 days post-MHV-1 infection), we again observed that GABA treatment significantly reduced the severity of illness and greatly increased the frequency of recovery. Therefore, the engagement of GABA receptors (GABA-Rs) prevented the MHV-1 infection-induced severe pneumonitis and death in mice. Given that GABA-R agonists, like GABA and homotaurine, are safe for human consumption, stable, inexpensive, and available worldwide, they are promising candidates to help prevent severe illness stemming from SARS-CoV-2 infection and other coronavirus strains.",Jide Tian; Blake Milddleton; Daniel L Kaufman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205237,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325423,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,False
164,Efficient culture of SARS-CoV-2 in human hepatoma cells enhances viability of the virus in human lung cancer cell lines permitting the screening of antiviral compounds,"Efforts to mitigate COVID-19 include screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be re-purposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50/mL, and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2 refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. The enhanced ability of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs, including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine, mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.

ImportanceThe cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801, two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral activity are observed depending on the cell line. Thus, it is essential to select the most relevant target cells for pre-clinical screenings of antiviral compounds, facilitated by using a virus with broader tropism.",Santseharay Ramirez; Carlota Fernandez-Antunez; Long Van Pham; Line Abildgaard Ryberg; Shan Feng; Martin Schou Pedersen; Lotte Scheibelein Mikkelsen; Judith M Gottwein; Ulrik Fahnoe; Jens Bukh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205385,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325316,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,False
165,Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in Long Term Care Facilities in England: a national survey,"Background: Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred worldwide in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to infection are poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in LTCFs. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults >65 years in England with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Exposures included: LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, and use of disease control measures. Main outcomes included risk factors for infection and outbreaks, estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and survey and test-based weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Findings: 5126/9081 (56%) LTCFs participated in the survey, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff. The weighted period prevalence of infection in residents and staff respectively was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.9-11.1%) and 3.8% (95%: 3.4-4.2%) and 2724 LTCFs (53.1%) had at least one case of infection. Odds of infection and/or outbreaks were reduced in LTCFs that paid sickness pay, cohorted staff, did not employ agency staff and had higher staff to resident ratios. Higher odds of infection and outbreaks were identified in facilities with more admissions, lower cleaning frequency, poor compliance with isolation and for profit status. Interpretation: Half of LTCFs had no cases suggesting they remain vulnerable to outbreaks. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting. Transmission from residents is associated with the number of admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation.

166,A Mechanism for Severity of Disease in Older Patients with COVID-19: The Nexus between Telomere Length and Lymphopenia,"Background: Lymphopenia due to a plummeting T-cell count is a major feature of severe COVID-19. T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and TL shortens with age. Older persons are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19, and we hypothesized that those with short TL have less capacity to mount an adequate T-cell proliferative response to SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis predicts that among older patients with COVID-19, shorter telomeres of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be associated with a lower lymphocyte count. Methods: Our sample comprised 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87(8) (mean(SD)) and 87 (9) years, respectively. We measured TL by the Telomere Shortest Length Assay, a novel method that measures and tallies the short telomeres directly relevant to telomere-mediated biological processes. The primary analysis quantified TL as the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases. For comparison, we also quantified TL by Southern blotting, which measures the mean length of telomeres. Results: Lymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 (0.42) in COVID-19 patients and 1.50(0.50) in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with the mean of telomeres measured by TeSLA (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte counts showed no statistically significant correlations with Southern blotting results in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that a compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response contributes to lymphopenia and the resulting disproportionate severity of COVID-19 among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.",Athanase Benetos; Tsung-Po Lai; Simon Toupance; Carlos Labat; Simon Verhulst; Christine Perret-Guillaume; Sylvie Gautier; Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer; Daniel Levy; Ezra Susser; Abraham Aviv,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205377,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205393,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
167,"Evaluation of the accuracy, ease of use and limit of detection of novel, rapid, antigen-detecting point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2","Abstract Background: Reliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostics not requiring laboratory infrastructure could be a game changer in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Global South. We assessed performance, limit of detection (LOD) and ease-of-use of three antigen-detecting, rapid POC diagnostics (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study, recruited participants suspected to have SARS-CoV2 in Germany and UK. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) or NP and/or oropharyngeal swabs (OP) were collected from participants (one for clinical real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and one for Ag-RDT testing). Performance of each of three Ag-RDTs was compared to RT-PCR overall, and according to predefined subcategories e.g. cycle threshold (CT)-value, days from symptom onset, etc. In addition, limited verification of analytical limit-of-detection (LOD) was determined. To understand the usability of each Ag-RDT a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use assessment were performed. Results: Between April 17th and August 25th, 2020, 2417 participants were enrolled, with 70 (3.0%) testing positive by RT-PCR. The best-performing test (SD Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q) was 76.6% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 62.8-86.4] sensitive and 99.3% [CI 98.6-99.6] specific. A sub-analysis showed all samples with RT-PCR CT-values <25 were detectable by STANDARD Q. The test was considered easy-to-use (SUS 86/100) and suitable for POC. Bioeasy and Coris showed specificity of 93.1% [CI 91.0%-94.8%] and 95.8% [CI 93.4%-97.4%], respectively, not meeting the predefined target of [&ge;]98%. Conclusion: There is large variability in performance of Ag-RDT tests with one test showing promise.

168,Genetic and non-genetic factors affecting the expression of COVID-19 relevant genes in the large airway epithelium,"Particular host and environmental factors influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19. We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings - a relevant tissue for SARS-CoV-2 infection - obtained from three cohorts of uninfected individuals, and investigated how non-genetic and genetic factors affect the regulation of host genes implicated in COVID-19. We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections.

169,Prognostic accuracy of MALDI mass spectrometric analysis of plasma in COVID-19,"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a global public health problem. There is a critical need for improvements in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis combined with bottom-up proteomic analysis of plasma proteins might identify features to predict high and low risk cases of COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We used MALDI-TOF MS to analyze plasma small proteins and peptides isolated using C18 micro-columns from a cohort containing a total of 117 cases of high (hospitalized) and low risk (outpatients) cases split into training (n = 88) and validation sets (n= 29). The plasma protein/peptide fingerprint obtained was used to train the algorithm before validation using a blinded test cohort. Results: Several sample preparation, MS and data analysis parameters were optimized to achieve an overall accuracy of 85%, sensitivity of 90%, and specificity of 81% in the training set. In the blinded test set, this signature reached an overall accuracy of 93.1%, sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 100%. From this signature, we identified two distinct regions in the MALDI-TOF profile belonging to the same proteoforms. A combination of 1D SDS-PAGE and quantitative bottom-up proteomic analysis allowed the identification of intact and truncated forms of serum amyloid A-1 and A-2 proteins. Conclusions: We found a plasma proteomic profile that discriminates against patients with high and low risk COVID-19. Proteomic analysis of C18-fractionated plasma may have a role in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19.

170,Corticosteroid pulses for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Effects on mortality and in-hospital stay.,"Objectives: To assess the influence of corticosteroid pulses on 60-days mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, intensive care admission, and hospital stay. Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y Leon, Spain (865.096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2 < 300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or died the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses, and 133 were not. 30,3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulses group and 42,9% (57/133) in the non-exposed cohort. These differences (12,6%) were statically significant (log-rank 4.72, p=0,03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5.31, p=0,021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0,561, p= 0,039). There were no significant differences in intensive care admission rate (p=0,173). The hospital stay was longer in the corticosteroid group (p<0,001). Conclusions: This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality.

171,Performance of a rapid SARS-COV-2 serology test in whole blood and separated plasma,"Rapid SARS-COV-2 related serology testing can help identify and manage the spread of infection in decentralized testing environments but the limitation in performance of existing tests in blood has restricted implementation of testing at the point-of-care. Optimization of existing rapid tests in whole blood will require significant effort in the short-term and there is a need for solutions to help bridge the gap in performance between plasma and whole blood. We demonstrate here the implementation of the H.E.R.M.E.S platform, a portable plasma separation system that can enhance the performance of blood-based diagnostic testing, with a commercially available SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM serology rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in a blinded study with 61 human samples. We compare the performance of the RDT in whole blood and separated plasma and highlight that plasma yields a 39% increase in positivity agreement with PCR in samples collected from patients with early infections. We further legitimize the increase in positivity agreement rate with the help of an independent evaluation by 10 previously untrained users. The H.E.R.M.E.S plasma separation system circumvents the need for assay optimization in whole blood and furthers the legitimacy of incorporating SARS-COV-2 serology RDTs at the point-of-care. The data highlighted in this work makes a compelling case for the incorporation of the H.E.R.M.E.S system in large scale efforts to perform SARS-COV-2 serology testing in decentralized testing environments.",Sasank Vemulapati,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204537,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20199083,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True

Methods: Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 members, mean age 84 years (SD=0.3), responded to an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n=190). We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes. Results: Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity. In multivariable regression models, adherence to guidance by leaving the house less often associated with less professional occupational class (OR=0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.98) and poorer self-rated general health (OR=0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92).

173,An Integrated Framework with Machine Learning and Radiomics for Accurate and Rapid Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray,"Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is considered the first key action to prevent spread of the virus. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as a gold standard point-of-care diagnostic tool. However, several limitations of RT-PCR have been identified, e.g., low sensitivity, cost, long delay in getting results and the need of a professional technician to collect samples. On the other hand, chest X-ray (CXR) is routinely used as a cost-effective diagnostic test for diagnosis and monitoring different respiratory abnormalities and is currently being used as a discriminating tool for COVID-19. However, visual assessment of CXR is not able to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to detect COVID-19 directly from CXR images with reasonably good accuracy on a data set that was randomly split into two subsets for training and test. Since these methods require a huge number of images for training, data augmentation with geometric transformation was applied to increase the number of images. It is highly likely that the images of the same patients are present in both the training and test sets resulting in higher accuracies in detection of COVID-19. It is, therefore, vital to assess the performance of COVID-19 detection algorithm on an independent data set with different degrees of the disease before being employed for clinical settings. On the other hand, machine learning techniques that depend on handcrafted features extraction and selection approaches can be trained with smaller data set. The features can also be analyzed separately for various lung conditions. Radiomics features are such kind of handcrafted features that represent heterogeneous appearance of the lung on CXR quantitatively and can be used to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Based on this hypothesis, a machine learning based technique is proposed here that is trained on a set of suitable radiomics features (71 features) to detect COVID-19. It is found that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ensemble Bagging Model Trees (EBM) trained on these 71 radiomics features can distinguish between COVID-19 and other diseases with an overall sensitivity of 99.6% and 87.8% and specificity of 85% and 97% respectively. Though the performance is comparable for both methods, EBM is more robust across severity levels. Severity, in this case, was scored between 0 to 4 by two experienced radiologists for each lung segment of each CXR image represents the degree of severity of the disease. For the case of 0 severity, sensitivity and specificity of the EBM method are 91.7% and 100% respectively indicating that there are certain radiomics pattern that are not visibly distinguishable. Since the proposed method does not require any manual intervention (e.g., sample collection etc.), it can be integrated with any standard X-ray reporting system to be used as an efficient, cost-effective and rapid early diagnosis device. It can also be deployed in places where quick results of the COVID-19 test are required, e.g., airports, seaports, hospitals, health clinics, etc.",Mahbubunnabi Tamal; Maha Alshammari; Meernah Alabdullah; Rana Hourani; Hossain Abu Alola; Tarek M.

We studied respiratory droplet generation and exhalation in human and nonhuman primate subjects with and without COVID-19 infection to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other changes in physiological state, translates into observable evolution of numbers and sizes of exhaled respiratory droplets in healthy and diseased subjects. In our observational cohort study of the exhaled breath particles of 74 healthy human subjects, and in our experimental infection study of eight nonhuman primates infected by aerosol with SARS-CoV-2, we found that exhaled aerosol particles increase one to three orders of magnitude with aging, high BMI, and COVID-19 infection. These variances appear to be related to changes in airway mucus surface composition and the propensity for mucus surfaces to breakup into small droplets during acts of breathing. We also observed that 20% of those participating in our human study accounted for 80% of the overall exhaled bioaerosol, reflecting a bioaerosol distribution analogous to a classical 20:80 super spreader distribution.",David A Edwards; Dennis Ausiello; Robert Langer; Jonathan Salzman; Tom Devlin; Brandon J.

Many HCW including the medical interns, are directly or indirectly involved in the management. Methods This is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on UMMC medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis. Results Our study shows that medical interns are tired (p = 0.014), starving (p = 0.004), have inadequate exercises (p = 0.004) and burdened with heavy workload (p=0.023) during pandemic period. Many are depressed (p = 0.043), scared to work (p = 0.03), and worried of getting infected (p < 0.05). Some quarrel with their colleagues (p < 0.05), losing contact with friends (p = 0.022) and feel that it will be beneficial to have a peer support group (p = 0.027). Conclusion In summary, the impact of COVID-19 amongst medical interns is significant and their overall well-being should be protected without jeopardising their training.",WeiHonn Lim; Li Ying Teoh; Kanesh Kumaran Seevalingam; Shanggar Kuppusamy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205070,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205112,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True

177,Cardiovascular risk factors are independently associated with COVID-19 mortality: a prospective cohort study,"Objectives: Recent reports suggest a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in COVID-19 patients, but the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in the clinical course of COVID-19 is unknown. We evaluated the time-to-event relationship between hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and COVID-19 outcomes. Design: We analyzed data from the prospective Dutch COVID-PREDICT cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection. Setting: Patients from 8 participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the COVID-PREDICT cohort were included. Participants: Admitted, adult patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or high suspicion based on CT-imaging of the thorax. Patients were followed for major outcomes during hospitalization. CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics. Primary and secondary outcomes measures: The primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of ICU-admission and ICU-mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors. Results: We included 1604 patients with a mean age of 66+-15 of whom 60.5% were men. Antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics were used by 45%, 34.7%, and 22.1% of patients. After adjustment for age and sex, the presence of [&ge;]2 risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk (HR 1.52, 95%CI 1.15-2.02), but not with ICU-admission. Moreover, the use of [&ge;]2 antidiabetics and [&ge;]2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of respectively 2.09 (95%CI 1.55-2.80) and 1.46 (95%CI 1.11-1.91). Conclusions: The accumulation of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes leads to a stepwise increased risk for short-term mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients independent of age and sex. Further studies investigating how these risk factors disproportionately affect COVID-19 patients are warranted.",Didier Collard; Nick S. Nurmohamed; Yannick Kaiser; Laurens F.

178,Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 Antibodies in Scottish Healthcare Workers,"Introduction: Healthcare workers are believed to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied. Methods: A prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace information. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison. Results: A total of 2062 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.2% were white. 299 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.1% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 11.8% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies. Conclusion: In this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. The seroprevalence data in different populations identified in this study will be useful to protect healthcare staff during future waves of the pandemic.",Hani Abo-Leyah; Stephanie Gallant; Diane Cassidy; Yan Hui Giam; Justin Killick; Beth Marshall; Gordon Hay; Thomas Pembridge; Rachel Strachan; Natalie Gallant; Benjamin Parcell; Jacob George; Elizabeth Furrie; James Duncan Chalmers,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325316,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205641,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
179,Circulating levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are lower in COVID-19 patients,"Background: To better understand the biology of COVID-19, we have explored the behavior of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), an angiogenic, vasodilating, and immune modulating peptide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Methods: Levels of CGRP in the serum of 57 COVID-19 patients (24 asymptomatic, 23 hospitalized in the general ward, and 10 admitted to the intensive care unit) and healthy donors (n=24) were measured by ELISA. In addition, to better understand the physiological consequences of the observed variations, we investigated by immunofluorescence the distribution of RAMP1, one of the components of the CGRP receptor, in autopsy lung specimens. Results: CGRP levels greatly decreased in COVID-19 patients (p<0.001) when compared to controls, and there were no significant differences due to disease severity, sex, age, or comorbidities. We found that COVID-19 patients treated with proton pump inhibitors had lower levels of CGRP than other patients not taking this treatment (p=0.001). RAMP1 immunoreactivity was found in smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels and the bronchial tree, and in the airways epithelium. In COVID-19 samples, RAMP1 was also found in proliferating type II pneumocytes, a common finding in these patients. Conclusions: The lower levels of CGRP should negatively impact the respiratory physiology of COVID-19 patients due to vasoconstriction, improper angiogenesis, less epithelial repair, and faulty immune response. Therefore, restoring CGRP levels in these patients may represent a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19.",Laura Ochoa-Callejero; Josune Garcia-Sanmartin; Pablo Villoslada-Blanco; Maria Iniguez; Patricia Perez-Matute; Rachel Brody; Jose A.

180,"Interactions between seasonal human coronaviruses and implications for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A retrospective study in Stockholm, Sweden, 2009-2020","Objectives The four seasonal coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are frequent causes of respiratory infections and show annual and seasonal variation. Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Methods Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020. Results Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2,130 samples (3.9%). OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4% of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0%), HKU1 (17.6%), and 229E (15.3%). The overall fraction of positive samples was relatively similar between seasons. In contrast, at species level there was distinct pattern of biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. The species showed different age distributions, with OC43 and 229E positivity being relatively constant across age strata, while the incidence of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age. Conclusions Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction. Symptomatic reinfections in adults and the elderly appear relatively common.

181,High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity in England during September 2020: interim report of round 5 of REACT-1 study,"Background: REACT-1 is a community survey of PCR confirmed swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 among random samples of the population in England. This interim report includes data from the fifth round of data collection currently underway for swabs sampled from the 18th to 26th September 2020. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 160,000 people in each round of data collection. Collection of self-administered nose and throat swab for PCR and questionnaire data. Prevalence of swab-positivity by round and by demographic variables including age, sex, region, ethnicity. Estimation of reproduction number (R) between and within rounds, and time trends using exponential growth or decay model. Assessment of geographical clustering based on boundary-free spatial model. Results: Over the 9 days for which data are available, we find 363 positives from 84,610 samples giving a weighted prevalence to date of 0.55% (0.47%, 0.64%) in round 5. This implies that 411,000 (351,000, 478,000) people in England are virus-positive under the assumption that the swab assay is 75% sensitive. Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased ~7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased ~5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were ~2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants. Conclusion: Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks.

182,"COVID-19 era, Preventive effect of no going out against co-infection of the seasonal influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2","In the situation where expansion of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) does not stop, there is concern about co-infection of people with the seasonal influenza infections from late autumn to winter 2020. Therefore, the importance of supplying vaccines against the seasonal influenza has been pointed out all over the world. As an example in Japan, the number of people infected with the seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which are the seasonal infectious diseases in the 2020 season, has decreased remarkably compared to the number of people infected each year. It is believed that the significant reduction in the number of people infected with these seasonal infectious diseases is a result of the pervasive hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in COVID-19 rea. To examine the correlation between the three factors of the number of people with each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate, we created a three-dimensional scatter plot based on these three factors using principal component analysis. Our research findings demonstrated preventive effect of no going out against co-infection with the seasonal influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",Takuma Hayashi; Nobuo Yaegashi; Ikuo Konishi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204727,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202739,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
183,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Brazil using digital technology,"Background: Brazil has the third-highest number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology. Methods: We used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Results: After calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19 occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated/reported ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19 cases (66 vs 38 cases/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively, p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing. Conclusion: In this population-based survey using digital technology in Brazil, we estimated that the COVID-19 case rates were 2.75 times higher than officially reported. The estimated per reported case ratios were higher in areas with worse socioeconomic status.",Faissal Nemer Hajar; Miguel Morita Fernandes-Silva; Gustavo S.

184,Oil Immersed Lossless Total Analysis System (OIL-TAS): Integrated RNA Extraction and Detection for SARS-CoV-2 Testing,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed difficulties in scaling current quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based diagnostic methodologies for large-scale infectious disease testing. Bottlenecks include the lengthy multi-step process of nucleic acid extraction followed by qPCR readouts, which require costly instrumentation and infrastructure, as well as reagent and plastic consumable shortages stemming from supply chain constraints. Here we report a novel Oil Immersed Lossless Total Analysis System (OIL-TAS), which integrates RNA extraction and detection onto a single device that is simple, rapid, cost effective, uses minimal supplies and requires reduced infrastructure to perform. We validated the performance of OIL-TAS using contrived samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, which show that the assay can reliably detect an input concentration of 10 copies/L and sporadically detect down to 1 copy/L. The OIL-TAS method can serve as a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-deploy alternative to current qPCR-based methods for infectious disease testing.",Duane S Juang; Terry D Juang; Dawn M Dudley; Christina M Newman; Thomas C Friedrich; David H O'Connor; David J Beebe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202739,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204842,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True

Given prior research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.",Victoria Jane En Long; Wei Shien Koh; Young Ern Saw; Jean CJ Liu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202739,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205187,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
186,Theta autoregressive neural network model for COVID-19 outbreak predictions,"An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the form of peculiar pneumonia has spread globally since its first case at Wuhan, China, in December 2019, increasing infected cases and mortality at a pandemic speed. Thus, forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic became a key research interest for both the epidemiologists and statisticians. These future predictions are useful for the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public-health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop the most suitable forecasting model that can generate real-time short-term (ten days) and long-term (fifty days) out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for eight profoundly affected countries, namely the United States of America, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, and Iran. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta model and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is proposed. The proposed method outperforms previously available single and hybrid forecasting models for COVID-19 predictions in most data sets. In addition, the ergodicity and asymptotic stationarity of the proposed TARNN model are established which is of particular interest in nonlinear time series literature.",TANUJIT CHAKRABORTY; Arinjita Bhattacharyya; Monalisha Pattnaik,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204917,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205021,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
187,The SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction rate has a high correlation with a contact index derived from large-scale individual location data using GPS-enabled mobile phones in Germany,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was first discovered in Hubei, China in December 2019, has caused an ongoing pandemic. Due to pauci-symptomatic cases, the virus may spread invisibly in a community. In the absence of vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like interpersonal distancing were implemented in several countries and have been key to effectively reduce viral spreading. In Germany after an exponential growth of case numbers in March 2020, NPIs were able to effectively control the pandemic and sufficiently reduced the daily reported new infections allowing for partial release of NPIs. We developed a novel statistical method to evaluate contacts between individuals, which is essential for virus transmission. We derived the contact index, an index for the intensity and heterogeneity of contact behavior from spatial proximity between individuals as proxy for physical interaction based on complex network science. We estimated the contact index from large-scale GPS mobile phone data of 1.15 to 1.4 million users in Germany per day (March to July 2020). A high correlation between the contact index and the effective reproduction number six days later could be observed (Pearson correlation r=0.96, P-value < 0.001 for all reported Pearson correlations). This correlation was observed in three different phases of the virus spread in Germany 1) the early phase of the first wave with the highest reproduction rate, 2) phase of strict NPIs (lockdown) with the lowest reproduction, 3) release of NPIs accompanied with an increase of reproduction. The results show that the contact index is able to model and potentially forecast the time evolution of the pandemic in Germany.",Sten Ruediger; Stefan Konigorski; Jonathan Edelman; Detlef Zernick; Christoph Lippert; Alexander Henry Thieme,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204917,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20188136,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True

In Java, reported cases and deaths increased throughout 2020 despite intensive control measures, particularly within Jakarta and during Ramadan. However, underlying trends are likely obscured by variations in case ascertainment. COVID-19 protocol funerals in Jakarta provide alternative data indicating a substantially higher burden than observed within confirmed deaths. Transmission estimates using this metric follow mobility trends, suggesting earlier and more sustained intervention impact than observed in routine data. Modelling suggests interventions have lessened spread to rural, older communities with weaker healthcare systems, though predict healthcare capacity will soon be exceeded in much of Java without further control.

189,Tracing and testing the COVID-19 contact chain: cost-benefit tradeoffs,"Traditional contact tracing for COVID-19 tests the direct contacts of those who test positive even if the contacts do not show any symptom. But, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? The question arises because by the time an infected individual is tested the infection starting from him may have infected a chain of individuals. One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of testing the contact chain of an individual who tests positive and discover that it can both substantially reduce the cumulative infection count over time and reduce the testing load over time. We also discover a phenomenon of diminishing return beyond a threshold value on the depth of the chain to be tested in one go, the threshold then provides the most desirable tradeoff between benefit in terms of reducing the cumulative infection count and cost in terms of increasing the testing load.",Jungyeol Kim; Xingran Chen; Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti; Saswati Sarkar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204842,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205047,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
190,A One-Minute Blood Test to Monitor Immune Responses in COVID-19 Patients and Predict Clinical Risks of Developing Moderate to Severe Symptoms,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought enormous loss and interruption to human life and the global economy since the first outbreak reported in China between late 2019 to early 2020, and will likely remain a public health threat in the months and years to come. Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, most people will develop no or mild symptoms, however, a small percentage of the population will become severely ill, require hospitalization, intensive care, and some succumb to death. The current knowledge of COVID-19 disease progression with worsening symptom complex implicates the critical importance of identifying patients with high clinical risk compared to those who would be at lower risk for disease control and patient management with better therapeutic output. Currently no clinical test is available that can predict risk factors and immune status change at different severity scales. The immune system plays a critical role in the defense against infectious diseases. Extensive research has found that COVID-19 patients with poor clinical outcomes differ significantly in their immune responses to the virus from those who exhibit milder symptoms. We previously developed a nanoparticle-enabled blood test that can detect the humoral immune status change in animals. In this study, we applied this new test to analyze the immune response in relation to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. From the testing of 153 COVID-19 patient samples and 142 negative controls, we detected statistically significant differences between COVID-19 patients with no or mild symptoms from those who developed moderate to severe symptoms. Mechanistic study suggests that these differences are associated with type 1 versus type 2 immune responses. We conclude that this new rapid test could potentially become a valuable clinical tool for COVID-19 patient risk stratification and management.",Chirajyoti Deb; Allan N Salinas; Aurea Middleton; Katelyn Kern; Daleen Penoyer; Rahul Borsadia; Charles Hunley; Vijay Mehta; Laura Irastorza; Devendra I Mehta; Tianyu Zheng; QUN HUO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205187,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203844,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
191,A Multiscale Coarse-grained Model of the SARS-CoV-2 Virion,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations, however, are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and on-going development of a largely ""bottom-up"" coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Structural data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data becomes publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

Significance StatementThis study reports the construction of a molecular model for the SARS-CoV-2 virion and details our multiscale approach towards model refinement.

192,SARS-CoV-2 infected cells present HLA-I peptides from canonical and out-of-frame ORFs,"T cell-mediated immunity may play a critical role in controlling and establishing protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet the repertoire of viral epitopes responsible for T cell response activation remains mostly unknown. Identification of viral peptides presented on class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) can reveal epitopes for recognition by cytotoxic T cells and potential incorporation into vaccines. Here, we report the first HLA-I immunopeptidome of SARS-CoV-2 in two human cell lines at different times post-infection using mass spectrometry. We found HLA-I peptides derived not only from canonical ORFs, but also from internal out-of-frame ORFs in Spike and Nucleoprotein not captured by current vaccines. Proteomics analyses of infected cells revealed that SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with antigen processing and immune signaling pathways. Based on the endogenously processed and presented viral peptides that we identified, we estimate that a pool of 24 peptides would provide one or more peptides for presentation by at least one HLA allele in 99% of the human population.

193,Safe and effective two-in-one replicon-and-VLP minispike vaccine for COVID-19,"The large SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates but can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, which may cause vaccination-induced complications or enhancement of COVID-19 disease. Besides, encoding of a functional S in replication-competent virus vector vaccines may result in the emergence of viruses with altered or expanded tropism. Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine, VSV{Delta}G-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients. Boost immunization with the identical replicon further enhanced neutralizing activity. These results demonstrate that rhabdovirus minispike replicons represent effective and safe alternatives to vaccination approaches using replication-competent viruses and/or the entire S antigen.

An extensive investigation of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for disease control. Various recombinant monoclonal antibodies of human origin that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been isolated from convalescent patients and will be applied as therapies and prophylaxis. However, the need for dedicated monoclonal antibodies in molecular pathology research is not fully addressed. Here, we produced mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibodies that exhibit not only robust performance in immunoassays including western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation, but also neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

195,Transmission of SARS-COV-2 from China to Europe and West Africa: a detailed phylogenetic analysis.,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019 in China and raised fears that it could overwhelm healthcare systems worldwide. In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.

The virus is mutating steadily and this is monitored by a well curated database of viral nucleotide sequences from samples taken from infected individual thus enabling phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic associations.

MethodsWe downloaded from the GISAID database, SARS-CoV-2 sequences established from four West African countries Ghana, Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria and then performed phylogenetic analysis employing the nextstrain pipeline. Based on mutations found within the sequences we calculated and visualized statistics characterizing clades according to the GISAID nomenclature.

ResultsWe found country-specific patterns of viral clades: the later Europe-associated G-clades predominantly in Senegal and Gambia, and combinations of the earlier (L, S, V) and later clades in Ghana and Nigeria. Contrary to our expectations, the later Europe-associated G-clades emerged before the earlier clades. Detailed analysis of distinct samples showed that some of the earlier clades might have circulated latently and some reflect migration routes via Mali and Tunisia.

ConclusionsThe distinct patterns of viral clades in the West African countries point at its emergence from Europe and China via Asia and Europe. The observation that the later clades emerged before the earlier clades could be simply due to founder effects or due to latent circulation of the earlier clades. Only a marginal correlation of the G-clades associated with the D614G mutation could be identified with the relatively low case fatality (0.6-3.2).

Key messagesO_LIGhana and Nigeria have a combination of earlier (L, V, S) and later Europe-associated G-clades of SARS-CoV-2, therefore pointing to multiple introductions while in Senegal and Gambia Europe-associated G-clades predominate pointing to introductions mainly from Europe.

196,SARS-CoV-2 proteins and anti-COVID-19 drugs induce lytic reactivation of an oncogenic virus,"An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease, has infected over 34,000,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 1,000,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. Due to the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells and its pathogenesis remain largely unclear, there are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Besides severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities may also increase risk of fatal disease outcome. Therefore, it is required to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on pre-existing diseases of patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. In the current study, we have reported that SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins and some anti-COVID-19 drugs currently used are able to induce lytic reactivation of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), one of major human oncogenic viruses through manipulation of intracellular signaling pathways.

197,SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with aggressive haematological malignancies,"The development of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of seroprevalence and may afford protection from infection. It has been presumed that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be impaired in patients with aggressive haematological malignancy (PHM) due to underlying immunological dysfunction caused by malignancy or systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT), placing them at increased risk. Here we analysed longitudinal serum samples from ten hospitalised PHM with aggressive disease and on SACT, collected up to 103 days post-onset of COVID-19 symptoms. We found that the majority (8/9) of PHM with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted and developed antibodies to the major SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1 and N) with most (6/8) produced neutralising antibody responses. Furthermore, the dynamics of antibody responses were broadly similar to that reported for the general population, except for a possible delay to seroconversion.

198,SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a UK population: detectable IgG for up to 20 weeks post infection.,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitated rapid and global responses across all areas of healthcare, including an unprecedented interest in serological immunoassays to detect antibodies to the virus. The dynamics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still not well understood. Methods We measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma samples from 880 people in Northern Ireland by Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA/IgM, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and EuroImmun IgG SARS-CoV-2 ELISA immunoassays to analyse immune dynamics over time. Using these results, we develop a ""pseudo gold standard"" reference cohort against which to assess immunoassay performance. We report performance metrics for the UK-RTC AbC-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) against a characterised panel of 304 positives established using the ""pseudo gold standard"" system and 350 negative samples. Results We detect persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG up to 140 days (20 weeks) post infection, across all three antibody immunoassays, at levels up to 4.4 times the cut-off for a positive result by Roche measurement. Using our ""pseudo gold standard"" cohort (n=348 positive, n=510 negative) we determine the sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial immunoassays used (EuroImmun; Sens. 98.9% [97.7-99.7%]; Spec. 99.2% [98.4-99.8%]; Roche; Sens. 99.4% [98.6-100%]; Spec. (96.7% [95.1-98.2%]; Abbott; Sens. 86.8% [83.1-90.2%]; Spec. (99.2% [98.4-99.8%]). The UK-RTC AbC-19 lateral flow immunoassay using shows a sensitivity of 97.70% (95.72%-99.34%) and specificity of 100% (100.00-100.00%). Conclusions Through comprehensive analysis of a large cohort of pre-pandemic and pandemic individuals, we show detectable levels of IgG antibodies, lasting up to 140 days, providing insight to immunity levels at later time points.

Herein, we report that high-throughput microfluidic screening of antigen-specific B-cells led to the identification of LY-CoV555, a potent anti-spike neutralizing antibody from a convalescent COVID-19 patient. Biochemical, structural, and functional characterization revealed high-affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain, ACE2 binding inhibition, and potent neutralizing activity. In a rhesus macaque challenge model, prophylaxis doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg reduced viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract. These data demonstrate that high-throughput screening can lead to the identification of a potent antiviral antibody that protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

200,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein promotes hyper-inflammatory response that can be ameliorated by Spike-antagonistic peptide and FDA-approved ER stress and MAP kinase inhibitors in vitro,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an inflammatory cytokine storm and acute lung injury. Currently there are no effective antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory therapies. Here we demonstrate that 2019 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (CoV2-S1) induces high levels of NF-{kappa}B activations, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mild epithelial damage, in human bronchial epithelial cells. CoV2-S1-induced NF-{kappa}B activation requires S1 interaction with human ACE2 receptor and early activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and associated unfolded protein response (UPR), and MAP kinase signalling pathways. We developed an antagonistic peptide that inhibits S1-ACE2 interaction and CoV2-S1-induced productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The existing FDA-approved ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylburic acid (4-PBA), and MAP kinase inhibitors, trametinib and ulixertinib, ameliorated CoV2-S1-induced inflammation and epithelial damage.

201,SARS-CoV-2 viral budding and entry can be modeled using virus-like particles,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and expeditiously spread across the globe causing a global pandemic. While a select agent designation has not been made for SARS-CoV-2, closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses are classified as Risk Group 3 select agents, which restricts use of the live viruses to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification make SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the US; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic.

202,Thiopurines activate an antiviral unfolded protein response that blocks viral glycoprotein accumulation in cell culture infection model,"Enveloped viruses, including influenza A viruses (IAVs) and coronaviruses (CoVs), utilize the host cell secretory pathway to synthesize viral glycoproteins and direct them to sites of assembly. Using an image-based high-content screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Selective disruption of IAV glycoprotein processing and accumulation by 6-TG and 6-TGo correlated with unfolded protein response (UPR) activation and HA accumulation could be partially restored by the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA). Chemical inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) restored accumulation of NA monomers in the presence of 6-TG or 6-TGo, but did not restore NA glycosylation or oligomerization. Thiopurines inhibited replication of the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), which also correlated with UPR/ISR activation and diminished accumulation of ORF1ab and nucleocapsid (N) mRNAs and N protein, which suggests broader disruption of coronavirus gene expression in ER-derived cytoplasmic compartments. The chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) had little effect on the UPR and did not affect IAV or HCoV-OC43 replication. Consistent with reports on other CoV Spike (S) proteins, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused UPR activation. 6-TG treatment inhibited accumulation of full length S0 or furin-cleaved S2 fusion proteins, but spared the S1 ectodomain. DBeQ, which inhibits the p97 AAA-ATPase required for retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins during ER-associated degradation (ERAD) restored accumulation of S0 and S2 proteins in the presence of 6-TG, suggesting that 6-TG induced UPR accelerates ERAD-mediated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 glycoproteins. Taken together, these data indicate that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective host-targeted antivirals that trigger the UPR and disrupt accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of these thiopurines in limiting IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in cell culture models.

IMPORTANCESecreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are folded and modified prior to transport. During infection, many viruses burden the ER with the task of creating and processing viral glycoproteins that will ultimately be incorporated into viral envelopes. Some viruses refashion the ER into replication compartments where viral gene expression and genome replication take place. This viral burden on the ER can trigger the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to increase the protein folding and processing capacity of the ER to match the protein load. Much remains to be learned about how viruses co-opt the UPR to ensure efficient synthesis of viral glycoproteins. Here, we show that two FDA-approved thiopurine drugs, 6-TG and 6-TGo, induce the UPR in a manner that impedes viral glycoprotein accumulation for enveloped influenza viruses and coronaviruses. These drugs may impede the replication of viruses that require precise tuning of the UPR to support viral glycoprotein synthesis for the successful completion of a replication cycle.",Patrick D Slaine; Mariel Kleer; Brett Duguay; Eric Stanley Pringle; Eileigh Kadijk; Shan Ying; Aruna D Balgi; Michel Roberge; Craig McCormick; Denys A Khaperskyy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.323915,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.319863,2020-10-01,2020-10-01,,False

The survey contained questions about demographics, mental health, academics, immigration, COVID-19 infection, and unemployment, in addition to mental health screens for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and stress (PSS-10). In total, 109 dreamers completed the survey. We observed remarkably high clinical levels of anxiety and depression: 47% of the dreamers met the clinical cutoff for anxiety, 63% met the cutoff for depression, and 67% (2 in 3) met the cutoff for anxiety and/or depression. Rates of anxiety and depression in our sample were significantly higher than those recently reported for college students overall, suggesting that dreamers may be experiencing a more severe mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that pandemic-induced concerns about finances, COVID-19 infection, immigration, and unemployment (among other factors) were associated with greater anxiety, stress, and depression among the dreamers in our sample. The present findings are consistent with recent predictions by social scientists that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a disproportionately negative impact on the mental health of undocumented immigrants.",Jarid Goodman; Sharron Xuanren Wang; Rubi A Guadarrama Ornelas; Marina Hernandez Santana,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.324046,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203489,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
207,COVID-19 Related Deaths Among Doctors In India,"Background: India has the most number of COVID-19 cases currently in the world, second only to the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused high mortality not only in patients but also health care providers. In this paper, our aim is to analyze the cases of deaths among Indian doctors due to COVID-19 infection. Methods: The details of data were taken from the list of the deceased doctors in India due to COVID-19 infection, which was compiled by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the top body of Indian doctors practicing modern allopathic medicine. The key data fields of age, specialty, and geographical location of the deceased doctors were extracted from the given list, and analysis was performed. Results: A total of 382 COVID-related deaths and 2174 infections were reported amongst doctors in India till 10 September 2020, with a case fatality rate of 16.7% among Indian doctors, which was ten times the CFR of 1.7% in the general population. Among the practicing doctors, after excluding the resident doctors and house surgeons, the CFR was 36.4%, which is almost 22 times more than what was seen in Indian general population. The average age of COVID-related deaths in Indian doctors was 60.8 years, with a median age of 60; 62% of deaths among doctors were in the above 60 years, age group. The maximum number of deceased doctors were amongst general practitioners 225(58.9%). Among the specialists, most deaths were seen in paediatricians 26(6.8%), medical specialists 24(6.3%), general surgeons 22(5.8%), obstetricians & gynecologists 16(4.2%), and anesthesiologists 14(3.7%). The highest COVID-19 related deaths in doctors were seen in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra in that order. Conclusions: The mortality rate is very high among doctors in India compared to the general population. The average age of COVID-19 related death was 60 years among doctors. General practitioners and 60 years+ doctors are at a much higher risk of mortality among the doctors. The states with the high number of COVID-19 cases in India, also had a higher number of doctor deaths.",Aanandita Kapoor; Krishan Mohan Kapoor,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.324046,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202796,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
208,Combination therapy with tocilizumab and corticosteroids for aged patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective study.,"Background: The role of combination immunomodulatory therapy with systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab (TCZ) for aged patients with COVID19 associated cytokine release syndrome remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single center study including consecutive patients older than 65 years that developed severe COVID19 between March 3 and May 1, 2020 and were treated with corticosteroids at various doses (methylprednisolone [0.5 mg/Kg/12 hours to 250 mg/24 hours]), either alone (CS group) or associated to intravenous tocilizumab (400 to 600 mg, one to three doses) (CS/TCZ group). Primary outcome was all cause mortality by day +14, whereas secondary outcomes included mortality by day +28 and clinical improvement (discharge and/or a 2 point decrease on a six point ordinal scale) by day +14. Propensity score (PS)based adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were applied. Results: Overall, 181 and 80 patients were included in the CS and CS TCZ groups. All cause 14 day mortality was lower in the CS/TCZ group, both in the PS adjusted (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17 to 0.68; P value = 0.002) and IPTW weighted models (odds ratio [OR]: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.68; P value = 0.001). This protective effect was also observed for 28 day mortality (PS adjusted HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.72; P value = 0.003). Clinical improvement by day +14 was higher in the CS/TCZ group in the IPTW analysis only (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.49 to 3.41; P value <0.001). The occurrence of secondary infection was similar between both groups.

209,LUNG ULTRASOUND FINDINGS IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IN AN URBAN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN THE UK,"COVID-19 can present with respiratory symptoms ranging from mild cough to viral pneumonia and ARDS. Lung ultrasonography has emerged as a promising imaging modality during the pandemic, but there is still a paucity of systematic analysis of lung ultrasound findings. In this retrospective observational study, 12 Zone ultrasound scans of COVID-19 positive patients were systematically analysed for pleural irregularities, subpleural consolidations, B lines, deep consolidations and effusions. Lung abnormalities were analysed according to overall frequency, frequency distribution in coronal and sagittal lung planes and were also correlated to clinical severity groups as determined by oxygenation deficit. Our results show that lung zones with abnormalities can occur juxtaposed to normal lung. Irregular pleural and small subpleural consolidations appear ubiquitously distributed throughout both lungs and occur early in the disease process. Wide B-lines are a predominant feature in COVID-19 infection. B-lines are found in a variety of patterns with number and width correlated to disease severity. In our analysis we also describe a previously unrecognised finding of small peri-pleural effusions in 8.7% of scans occurring in all areas of the lung. The current results form the basis for a more thorough understanding of the lung changes occurring in COVID-19 and the incorporation of lung ultrasound in the setting of COVID-19 infection including triage, diagnosis, treatment approach and prognosis.",Julia Burkert; Hannah Dunlop; Rachel Stewart; Adam Treacy; Robert Jarman; Paramjeet Deol,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.323220,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20182626,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
210,Potential spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity - a mathematical modeling study,"COVID-19 is caused by a hitherto nonexistent pathogen, hence the immune response to the disease is currently unknown. Studies conducted over the past few weeks have found that the antibody titre levels in the blood plasma of infected patients decrease over time, as is common for acute viral infections. Fully documented reinfection cases from Hong Kong, India, Belgium and USA, as well as credible to anecdotal evidence of second-time cases from other countries, bring into sharp focus the question of what profile the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. Here we use mathematical modeling to answer this question, constructing a novel delay differential equation model which is tailored to accommodate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) where a recovered case becomes completely susceptible after a given time interval following infection and (b) where a first-time recovered case becomes susceptible to a lower virulence infection after a given time interval following recovery, and becomes permanently immunized by a second infection. We find possible solutions exhibiting large number of waves of disease in the first situation and two to three waves in the second situation. Interestingly however, these multiple wave solutions are manifest only for some intermediate values of the reproduction number R, which is governed by public health intervention measures. For sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the short-lived immunity. Our results cast insight into the potential spreading dynamics of the disease and might also be useful for analysing the spread after a vaccine is invented, and mass vaccination programs initiated.",B Shayak; Mohit Manoj Sharma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204636,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204636,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
211,Large scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from one region allows detailed epidemiology and enables local outbreak management,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3,200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organisations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1,565 positive samples (172 per 100,000 population) from 1,376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. 1,035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically-distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a sublineage associated with 6 care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients indicating infection control measures were effective; found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.",Andrew J Page; Alison E Mather; Thanh Le Viet; Emma J Meader; Nabil-Fareed J Alikhan; Gemma L Kay; Leonardo de Oliveira Martins; Alp Aydin; David J Baker; Alexander J.

212,Widening the gap: greater racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden after accounting for missing race/ethnicity data,"Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous persons in the United States have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19, due to persistent social inequities. The magnitude of the disparity is unclear, however, because race/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. In this study, we quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias-adjustment for misclassification. After bias-adjustment, the magnitude of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity, measured as the difference in infection rates between classified Black and Hispanic persons compared to classified White persons, increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in infection rates. Collecting race/ethnicity information at time of testing is optimal. However, when data are missing, combined imputation and bias-adjustment improves estimates of the racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.",Katie Labgold; Sarah Hamid; Sarita Shah; Neel R Gandhi; Allison Chamberlain; Fazle Khan; Shamimul Khan; Sasha Smith; Steve Williams; Timothy Lee Lash; Lindsay J Collin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20201475,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203315,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
213,Artificial intelligence to predict the risk of mortality from COVID-19: Insights from a Canadian Application,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) has had enormous impacts, indicating need for non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) using Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling. Investigation of AI models and statistical models provides important insights within the province of Ontario as a case study application using patients' physiological conditions, symptoms, and demographic information from datasets from Public Health Ontario (PHO) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The findings using XGBoost provide an accuracy of 0.9056 for PHO, and 0.935 for the PHAC datasets. Age is demonstrated to be the most important variable with the next two variables being Hospitalization and Occupation. Further, AI models demonstrate identify the importance of improved medical practice which evolved over the six months in treating COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, and that age is absolutely now the key factor, with much lower importance of other variables that were important to mortality near the beginning of the pandemic. An XGBoost model is shown to be fairly accurate when the training dataset surpasses 1000 cases, indicating that AI has definite potential to be a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19 even when caseload numbers needed for effective utilization of AI model are not large.",Brett Snider; Paige Phillips; Aryn MacLean; Edward A McBean; Andrew Gadsden; John Yawney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20201475,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20201632,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
214,Time-series clustering for home dwell time during COVID-19: what can we learn from it?,"In this study, we investigate the potential driving factors that lead to the disparity in the time-series of home dwell time, aiming to provide fundamental knowledge that benefits policy-making for better mitigation strategies of future pandemics. Taking Metro Atlanta as a study case, we perform a trend-driven analysis by conducting Kmeans time-series clustering using fine-grained home dwell time records from SafeGraph, and further assess the statistical significance of sixteen demographic/socioeconomic variables from five major categories. We find that demographic/socioeconomic variables can explain the disparity in home dwell time in response to the stay-at-home order, which potentially leads to disparate exposures to the risk from the COVID-19. The results further suggest that socially disadvantaged groups are less likely to follow the order to stay at home, pointing out the extensive gaps in the effectiveness of social distancing measures exist between socially disadvantaged groups and others. Our study reveals that the long-standing inequity issue in the U.S. stands in the way of the effective implementation of social distancing measures. Policymakers need to carefully evaluate the inevitable trade-off among different groups, making sure the outcomes of their policies reflect interests of the socially disadvantaged groups.",Xiao Huang; Zhenlong Li; Junyu Lu; Sicheng Wang; Hanxue Wei; Baixu Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203315,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202671,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
215,Passive Microwave Radiometry (MWR) for diagnostics of COVID-19 lung complications.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 it as a global pandemic. It becomes clear that the virus is spreading mostly deadly due to limited access to diagnostics tests and equipment. Traditional radiography and CT remain the main methods of the initial examination of the chest organs. Now, most of the diagnostics has been focused on PCR, chest X-Ray/CT manifestations of COVID-19. However, there are problems with CT due to infection control issues, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in LMIC (Low Middle Income Countries). Passive microwave radiometry (MWR) is a cheap, non-radioactive and portable technology. It has already been used for diagnostics of cancer, and other diseases. We have tested if MWR could be used for early diagnostics of pulmonary COVID-19 complications. This was a randomized controlled trial (195 subjects) to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics using MWR in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 while they are in hospitals of Kyrgyzstan, and healthy individuals. We have measured skin (IR) and internal (MWR) temperature by recording passive electromagnetic radiation through the chest wall in the projection of the lungs at 30 symmetrical points on both sides. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by X-RAY/CT scan and doctor final diagnosis (pn+/pn-). COVID-19 was determined by PCR test (covid+/covid-). The best results were obtained between pn-/covid- and pn+/covid+ groups with sensitivity 92% and specificity 75%. Overall, the study suggests that the use of MWR is a convenient and safe method for screening diagnostics in COVID-19 patients with suspected pneumonia. Since MWR is an inexpensive, it will ease the financial burden for both patients and the countries, especially in LMIC",Batyr Osmonov; Lev Ovchinnikov; Christopher Galazis; Berik Emilov; Mustafa Karaibragimov; Meder Seitov; Sergey Vesnin; Turat Kasymbekov; Chingis Mustafin; Igor Goryanin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203315,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20202598,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True

Design--Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Data sources--Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, medRxiv, PROSPERO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Also review of reference lists from recent meta-analyses. Study selection--Randomized clinical trials in which participants were treated with HCQ or placebo/standard-of-care for pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, or outpatient therapy for COVID-19. Methods--Two investigators independently extracted data on trial design and outcomes. Medication side effects and adverse reactions were also assessed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 hospitalization or death. When unavailable, new COVID-19 infection was used. We calculated random effects meta-analysis according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated by calculation of Cochran Q and I2 parameters. An Egger funnel plot was drawn to investigate publication bias. We also calculated the fixed effects meta-analysis summary of the five studies. All calculations were done in Excel, and results were considered to be statistically significant at a two-sided threshold of P=.05. Results--Five randomized controlled clinical trials enrolling 5,577 patients were included. HCQ was associated with a 24% reduction in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization or death, P=.025 (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97]). No serious adverse cardiac events were reported.

217,An integrated clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of severe COVID-19,"Background: Age and gender are often the only considerations in determining risk of severe COVID-19. There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Methods: Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC=0.786) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC=0.635). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors -- not age and gender -- that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. Conclusions: We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.",Gillian S Dite; Nicholas M Murphy; Richard Allman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20201632,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204453,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
218,Dry loop mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a major disease burden on many countries around the world. The spread of COVID-19 is anticipated to have a major impact on developing countries including African nations. To establish a point-of-care test for COVID-19, we developed a dry loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. We carried out reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP using the Loopamp SARS-CoV-2 Detection kit (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). The entire mixture except for the primers is dried and immobilized inside the tube lid. To determine the specificity of the kit, 22 viral genomes associated with respiratory infections, including the SARS coronavirus, were tested. No LAMP product was detected in reactions performed with RNA from these pathogens. The sensitivity of this assay, determined by either a real-time turbidity assay or colorimetric change of the reaction mixture, as evaluated by the naked eye or under illumination with ultraviolet light, was 10 copies/reaction. After the initial validation analysis, we analyzed 24 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected to have COVID-19. Nineteen (79.2%) of the 24 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Using the Loopamp SARS-CoV-2 Detection kit, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 15 (62.5%) of the 24 samples. Thus, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Loopamp 2019-CoV-2 detection reagent kit were 94.0%, 96.0%, 95.9%, and 94.1%, respectively.

Here, the only useful tests (a) require no sample transport, (b) require minimal sample manipulation, (c) can be performed by unlicensed individuals, (d) return results on the spot in much less than one hour, and (e) cost no more than a few dollars. The sensitivity need not be as high as normally required by the FDA for screening asymptomatic carriers (as few as 10 virions per sample), as these viral loads are almost certainly not high enough for an individual to present a risk for forward infection. This allows tests specifically useful for this pandemic to trade-off unneeded sensitivity for necessary speed, simplicity, and frugality. In some studies, it was shown that viral load that creates forward-infection risk may exceed 105 virions per milliliter, easily within the sensitivity of an RNA amplification architecture, but unattainable by antibody-based architectures that simply target viral antigens.

220,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reverses anti-PD-1 immune murine checkpoint blockade: TCF1 as a marker in humans for COVID-19 and HCQ therapy,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious threat to global public health. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic azithromycin (AZ) are still being used by thousands and numerous hospitals to treat COVID-19. In a related context, immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade (ICB) with antibodies such as anti-PD-1 has revolutionised cancer therapy. Given that cancer patients on ICB continue to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, an understanding of the effects of HCQ and AZ on the elimination of tumors by anti-PD-1 ICB is urgently needed. In this study, we report that HCQ alone, or in combination with AZ, at doses used to treat COVID-19 patients, reverses the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in controlling B16 melanoma tumor growth in mice. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors, or in using AZ alone in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8+CD44+PD-1+TCF1+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8+CD44+PD-1+ effectors. Surprisingly, it also blocked the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4+ T-cells, FoxP3+ Tregs, thymic subsets, B-cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice. Lastly, we identified TCF-1 expression in peripheral CD8+ T-cells from cancer or non-cancer human patients infected with SARs CoV2 as a marker for the effects of COVID-19 and HCQ on the immune system. This study indicates for the first time that HCQ and HCQ/AZ negatively impact the ability of anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade to promote tumor rejection.",Janna Kreuger; Francois Santinon; Alexandra Kazanova; Mark Issa; Bruno Larrivee; Catalin Milhalcioiu; Christopher E.

Methods Based on a previous study of international allocation for pandemic COVID-19 vaccines, we classified the entire world population into eleven priority groups. Information on priority groups was derived from a multi-pronged search of official websites, media sources and academic journal articles. The sizes of different priority groups were projected for 194 countries globally. Results Overall, the size of COVID-19 vaccine recipient population varied markedly by goals of the vaccination program and geography. The general population aged <60 years without any underlying condition accounts for the majority of the total population (5.2 billion people, 68%), followed by 2.3 billion individuals at risk of severe disease, and 46.9 million essential workers which are critical to maintaining a functional society. Differences in the demographic structure, presence of underlying conditions, and number of essential workers led to highly variable estimates of target populations both at the WHO region and country level. In particular, Europe has the highest share of essential workers (6.8%) and the highest share of individuals with underlying conditions (37.8%), two priority categories to maintain societal functions and reduce severe burden. In contrast, Africa has the highest share of healthy adults, school-age individuals, and infants (77.6%), which are the key groups to target to reduce community transmission. Interpretation The sizeable distribution of target groups on a country and regional bases underlines the importance of equitable and efficient vaccine prioritization and allocation globally. The direct and indirect benefits of COVID-19 vaccination should be balanced by considering local differences in demography and health.",Wei Wang; Qianhui Wu; Juan Yang; Kaige Dong; Xinghui Chen; Xufang Bai; Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; C&eacutecile Viboud; Marco Ajelli; Hongjie Yu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20202598,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20200469,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
222,Virus evolution affected early COVID-19 spread,"As the SARS-Cov-2 virus spreads around the world afflicting millions of people, it has undergone divergent genetic mutations. Although most of these mutations are expected to be inconsequential, some mutations in the spike protein structure have been hypothesized to affect the critical stage at which the virus invades human cells, which could affect transmission probability and disease expression. If true, then we expect an increased growth rate of reported COVID-19 cases in regions dominated by viruses with these altered proteins. We modeled early global infection dynamics based on clade assignment along with other demographic and meteorological factors previously found to be important. Clade, but not variant D614G which has been associated with increased viral load, enhanced our ability to describe early COVID-19 growth dynamics. Including clade identity in models significantly improved predictions over earlier work based only on weather and demographic variables. In particular, higher proportions of clade 19A and 19B were negatively correlated with COVID-19 growth rate, whereas higher proportions of 20A and 20C were positively correlated with growth rate. A strong interaction between the prevalence of clade 20C and relative humidity suggests that the impact of clade identity might be more important when coupled with certain weather conditions. In particular, 20C an 20A generate the highest growth rates when coupled with low humidity. Projections based on data through April 2020 suggest that, without intervention, COVID-19 has the potential to grow more quickly in regions dominated by the 20A and 20C clades, including most of South and North America.",Derek Corcoran; Mark C Urban; Jill Wegrzyn; Cory Merow,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204693,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20202416,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
223,Estimation of novel coronavirus (covid-19) reproduction number and case fatality rate: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Understanding the transmission dynamics and the severity of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) informs public health interventions, surveillance, and planning. Two important parameters, the basic reproduction number (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19, help in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R0 and CFR of COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. We carried out a systematic review to retrieve the published estimates of the R0 and the CFR in articles from international databases between 1st January and 31st August 2020. Random-effect models and Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of the R0 and the CFR. Furthermore, the R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where studies were conducted. The I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test were applied to assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected studies. Forty-five studies involving R0 and thirty-four studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of the R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied significantly, from 2.51 (2.12, 2.95) in Asia to 7.11 (6.38, 7.91) in Africa. We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs. 2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs. 2.27). However, the R0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. An R0 of 2.69 and CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19. Although R0 and CFR may vary over time, space, and demographics, we recommend considering these figures in control and prevention measures.",Tanvir Ahammed; Aniqua Anjum; Mohammad Meshbahur Rahman; Najmul Haider; Richard Kock; Md.

224,Propagation of Viral Bioaerosols Indoors,"Here we look into the spread of aerosols indoors that may potentially carry viruses. Many viruses, including the novel Covid-19, are known to spread via airborne and air-dust pathways. From the literature data and our own research on the propagation of fine aerosols, we simulate herein the carryover of viral aerosols in indoor air. We demonstrate that a great deal of fine droplets released from an infected person coughing, sneezing or talking propagate very fast and to large distances indoors, as well as bend around obstacles, lift up and down over staircases, and so on. This study suggests equations to evaluate the concentration of those droplets, depending on time and distance from the source of infection. Estimates are given for the safe distance to the source of infection, and available methods for neutralizing viral aerosols indoors are considered.",Olga B Kudryashova; Evgeny V Muravlev; Alexandra A Antonnikova,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204453,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20199943,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
225,Forecasting Covid-19 Infections and Deaths Horizon in Egypt,"The coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic is defining a global health crisis, which is the hugest challenge the world has faced since World War II. Accordingly, the global economy as well is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and/or evaluating countermeasures. The aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible. The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be 5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or transmitted is necessary. Besides, being prepared with re-imposing lockdown strategies and health system support are essential among others. It should also be noted that this expected pattern can shift, yet that depends on people's actions.",Shereen Nosier; Reham Salah Beram,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204453,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202911,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
226,Viral genomes reveal patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Washington State,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has gravely impacted societies around the world. Outbreaks in different parts of the globe are shaped by repeated introductions of new lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State (USA) was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we see evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we do not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient outcomes. Overall, this suggests that at least to date, the behavior of individuals has been more important in shaping the course of the pandemic than changes in the virus.",Nicola Felix Mueller; Cassia Wagner; Chris D.

227,Spectrum of spinal cord involvement in COVID-19: A systematic review,"Background and aims- Recent reports reveal incidences of spinal cord involvement in form of para-infectious or post-infectious myelitis raising potential concerns about the possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 behind the pathogenesis of spinal cord demyelination. In this study, we intend to summarise so far available pieces of evidence documenting SARS-CoV-2 mediated spinal demyelination in terms of clinical, laboratory parameters and imaging characteristics. Methodology- This review was carried out based on the existing PRISMA (Preferred Report for Systemic Review and Meta-analyses) consensus statement. Data was collected from four databases: Pubmed/Medline, NIH Litcovid, Embase and Cochrane library and Preprint servers up till 10th September, 2020. Search strategy comprised of a range of keywords from relevant medical subject headings which includes ""SARS-COV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""demyelination"" etc. Results- A total of 21 cases were included from 21 case reports after screening from various databases and preprint servers. Biochemical analysis reveals that the majority of cases showed elevated CSF protein as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis. Interestingly, a majority of cases were found to be associated with long extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), and remaining cases were found to be associated with isolated patchy involvement or isolated short segment involvement or combined LETM and patchy involvement. Few cases were also found with significant co-involvement of the brain and spine based on the imaging data. Conclusion- It can be interpreted that SARS-CoV-2 may play a potential role in spinal demyelinating disorders in both para-infectious and post-infectious forms.",Ritwick Mondal; Shramana Deb; Gourav Shome; Upasana Ganguly; Durjoy Lahiri; Julian Benito Leon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204297,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203554,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
228,Projected HIV and Bacterial STI Incidence Following COVID-Related Sexual Distancing and Clinical Service Interruption,"BACKGROUND. The global COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to indirectly impact the transmission dynamics and prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Studies have already documented reductions in sexual activity (""sexual distancing"") and interruptions in HIV/STI services, but it is unknown what combined impact these two forces will have on longer-term HIV/STI epidemic trajectories. METHODS. We adapted a network-based model of co-circulating HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia for a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta area. Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-related sexual distancing in casual and one-time partnership networks and service interruption within four service categories (HIV screening, HIV PrEP, HIV ART, and STI treatment). RESULTS. A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM: -227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (-23,800 cases). Greater relative reductions and longer durations of service interruption would increase HIV and STI incidence, while greater relative reductions and longer durations of sexual distancing would decrease incidence of both. If distancing lasted only 3 months but service interruption lasted 18 months, the total 5-year population impact would be an additional 890 HIV cases and 57,500 STI cases. CONCLUSIONS. The counterbalancing impact of sexual distancing and clinical service interruption depends on the infection and the extent and durability of these COVID-related changes. If sexual behavior rebounds while service interruption persists, we project an excess of hundreds of HIV cases and thousands of STI cases just among Atlanta MSM over the next 5 years. Immediate action to limit the impact of service interruptions is needed to address the indirect effects of the global COVID pandemic on the HIV/STI epidemic.",Samuel M Jenness; Adrien Le Guillou; Christina Chandra; Laura M Mann; Travis Sanchez; Daniel Westreich; Julia L Marcus,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204529,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
229,Mitigating the transmission of infection and death due to SARS-CoV-2 through non-pharmaceutical interventions and repurposing drugs,"The Covid-19 pandemic has put the world under immeasurable stress. There is no specific drug or vaccine that can cure the infection or protect people from the infection of coronavirus. It is therefore prudent to use the existing resources and control strategies in an optimal way to contain the virus spread and provide the best possible treatments to the infected individuals. Use of the repurposing drugs along with the non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies may be the right way for fighting against the ongoing pandemic. It is the objective of this work to demonstrate through mathematical modelling and analysis how and to what extent such control strategies can improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden. The criteria for disease elimination & persistence were established through the basic reproduction number. A case study with the Indian Covid-19 epidemic data is presented to visualize and illustrate the effects of lockdown, maintaining personal hygiene & safe distancing, and repurposing drugs. It is shown that India can significantly improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden through the combined use of NPIs and repurposing drugs though containment of spreading is difficult without serious community participation.",Chittaranjan Mondal; Debadatta Adak; Abhijit Majumder; Nandadulal Bairagi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202804,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
230,Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-Cas13a and a mobile phone,"The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, asymptomatic and pre- symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilize RNA and DNA-targeting enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and accurate. Here we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a-based mobile phone assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA extracts. The assay achieved ~100 copies/L sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Combined with mobile phone-based quantification, this assay can provide rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening to aid in the control of SARS-CoV-2.",Parinaz Fozouni; Sungmin Son; María Díaz de León Derby; Gavin J Knott; Carley N Gray; Michael V D'Ambrosio; Chunyu Zhao; Neil A Switz; G.

231,"Evaluation of high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in a longitudinal cohort of mild COVID-19 patients: sensitivity, specificity and association with virus neutralization test","Objectives: We evaluated widely-used SARS-CoV-2 serological tests and their potential association with virus neutralization test (VNT) in a cohort of mild COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 439 specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19. Nine serological assays developed by leading global companies (Abbott, DiaSorin, Siemens, Bio-Rad, Wantai, bioMerieux, Euroimmun) were assessed. For each test the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined weekly after symptom onset. Correlation and concordance were assessed using the Spearman and Cohen Kappa coefficients, respectively. Positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the VNT were also determined. Results: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The best correlation between antibody level and neutralizing antibody titer was found with the Euroimmun S1-based IgA assay (Spearman coefficient [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.61-0.79]). A moderate concordance (Kappa [95%CI]: 0.43[0.23-0.63]) as well as the lowest NPA (33%) was found between the Wantai Total Ab assay and the VNT. Compared to the Wantai Total Ab assay, other total Ab or IgG assays targeting the S or the RBD (bioMerieux, DiaSorin, Siemens,) were more concordant with the VNT (Kappa>0.7 for the three tests) and had a higher NPA (range: 90% to 97%). Conclusions: Although some assays presented a better concordance with VNT than others, the present findings emphasize that commercialized serological tests including those targeting the RBD cannot substitute VNT for the assessment of functional antibody response.",Antonin Bal; Bruno Pozzetto; Mary-Anne Trabaud; Vanessa Escuret; Muriel Rabilloud; Carole Langlois-jacques; Adele Paul; Nicolas Guibert; Constance D'aubarde; Amelie Massardier; Andre Boibieux; Florence Morfin; Virginie Pitiot; Francois Gueyffier; Bruno Lina; Jean Baptiste Fassier; Sophie Assant,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20193110,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20194290,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
232,Geospatial Analysis of Individual and Community-Level Socioeconomic Factors Impacting SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence and Outcomes,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority communities across the United States. We sought to disentangle individual and census tract-level sociodemographic and economic factors associated with these disparities. Methods and Findings: All adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1 and June 21, 2020 were geocoded to a census tract based on their address; hospital employees and individuals with invalid addresses were excluded. Individual (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, insurance) and census tract-level (demographics, insurance, income, education, employment, occupation, household crowding and occupancy, built home environment, and transportation) variables were analyzed using linear mixed models predicting infection, hospitalization, and death from SARS-CoV-2. Among 57,865 individuals, per capita testing rates, individual (older age, male sex, non-White race, non-English preferred language, and non-private insurance), and census tract-level (increased population density, higher household occupancy, and lower education) measures were associated with likelihood of infection. Among those infected, individual age, sex, race, language, and insurance, and census tract-level measures of lower education, more multi-family homes, and extreme household crowding were associated with increased likelihood of hospitalization, while higher per capita testing rates were associated with decreased likelihood. Only individual-level variables (older age, male sex, Medicare insurance) were associated with increased mortality among those hospitalized. Conclusions: This study of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a major U.S. city presents the cascade of outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection within a large, multi-ethnic cohort. SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization rates, but not death rates among those hospitalized, are related to census tract-level socioeconomic characteristics including lower educational attainment and higher household crowding and occupancy, but not neighborhood measures of race, independent of individual factors.",Sara J Cromer; Chirag M Lakhani; Deborah J Wexler; Sherri-Ann M Burnett-Bowie; Miriam Udler; Chirag J Patel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20200469,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20201830,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True

Between 16th April and 15th June 2020, 2,312 residual sera were collected from patients having carried out a blood analysis in one of the participating laboratories. Residual sera obtained from persons of all ages were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG using the EUROIMMUN enzyme immunoassay kit for semiquantitative detection of IgG antibodies against S1 domain of viral spike protein (ELISA-S). Borderline and positive samples in ELISA-S were also tested with an in-house virus neutralization test (VNT). Prevalence values were adjusted for sex and age. A total of 1,973 residual sera samples were included in the study. The overall seroprevalence based on ELISA-S was 5.27% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.33-6.35] and 5.46% [4.51-6.57] after adjustment. Gender was not associated with IgG detection. However, significant differences were observed between age groups (p-value = 1 E-5) and particularly for people being younger than 50 years of age (Odd ratio (OR) = 2.86 95% CI [1.80- 4.53]; p-value <0.000001*).

234,Psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic in Chile: the role of economic uncertainty,"Previous research has shown that the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing and lockdown can affect people's psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to estimate the extent to which perceptions and expectations regarding the social, economic and domestic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are associated with psychological distress, and identify some demographic, psychosocial and economic factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile. 1078 people participated in a telephone survey between May 30 and June 10, 2020. The sample is representative of the Chilean adult population. Psychological distress was assessed through a questionnaire of anxious and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). We analyze the data set using ordinary least-squares regression models, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then stratifying the sample into different groups to explore differences by gender and age. 19.2% participants displayed significant psychological distress, with moderate to severe anxiety-depression symptoms being more prevalent in women than in men (23.9% vs 14.09%, chi square 6.89, p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that being a woman, feeling lonely and isolated, living in the areas hit hardest by the pandemic and lockdown, expecting a lack of income due to having to stop working as a consequence of the pandemic, and having a history of mental health diagnosis are significantly associated with psychological distress (p < 0.05).

235,Examining Australian public perceptions and behaviors towards a future COVID-19 vaccine,"Background: There is an indication that vaccine(s) for COVID-19 could be available by early 2021. As immunisation program launches have previously demonstrated, it is essential that careful planning occurs now to ensure the readiness of the public for a COVID-19 vaccine. As part of that process, this study aimed to understand the public perceptions regarding a future COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Participants generally held positive views towards vaccination. Eighty percent (n=1143) agreed with the statement that getting myself vaccinated for COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection. Females (614, 83%) were more likely to agree with the statement than males (529, 78%) (aOR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8); P=0.029), while 90.9% aged 70 and above agreed compared to 76.6% aged 18-29 year old (aOR=2.3 (95% CI:1.2-4.1); 0.008). Agreement was also higher for those with a self-reported chronic disease (aOR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0); P=0.043) and among those who held private health insurance (aOR=1.7 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3); P<0.001). Beyond individual perceptions, 78% stated that their decision to vaccinate would be supported by family and friends Conclusion: This study presents an early indication of public perceptions towards a future COVID-19 vaccine and represents a starting point for mapping vaccine perceptions.

236,Identification of biological correlates associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with participants recruited from Italy and Spain by an international consortium group. Methods: Summary GWAS statistics for 1610 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and 2205 controls were downloaded. In the current study, we analyzed the summary statistics with the information of loci and p-values for 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using gene ontology analysis to determine the top biological processes implicated in respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Results: We considered the top 708 SNPs, using a p-value cutoff of 5x10-5, which were mapped to the nearest genes, leading to 144 unique genes. The list of genes was input into a curated database to conduct gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. The top-ranked biological processes were wound healing, epithelial structure maintenance, muscle system processes, and cardiac-relevant biological processes with a false discovery rate < 0.05. In the PPI analysis, the largest connected network consisted of 8 genes. Through literature search, 7 out of the 8 genes were found to be implicated in both pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Conclusion: Gene ontology and protein-protein interaction analyses identified cardio-pulmonary processes that may partially explain the risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.",Jung Hun Oh; Allen Tannenbaum; Joseph Deasy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204644,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204289,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
237,The Challenge of Forecasting Demand of Medical Resources and Supplies During a Pandemic: A Comparative Evaluation of Three Surge Calculators for COVID-19,"Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, there has been a public health debate concerning medical resources and supplies including hospital beds, intensive care units (ICU), ventilators, and Protective Personal Equipment (PPE). Forecasting COVID-19 dissemination has played a key role in informing healthcare professionals and governments on how to manage overburdened healthcare systems. However, forecasting during the pandemic remained challenging and sometimes highly controversial. Here, we highlight this challenge by performing a comparative evaluation for the estimations obtained from three COVID-19 surge calculators under different social distancing approaches, taking Lebanon as a case study. Despite discrepancies in estimations, the three surge calculators used herein agree that there will be a relative shortage in the capacity of medical resources and a significant surge in PPE demand as the social distancing policy is removed. Our results underscore the importance of implementing containment interventions including social distancing in alleviating the demand for medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of any medication or vaccine. It is said that ''All models are wrong, but some are useful'', in this paper we highlight that it is even more useful to employ several models.",Amina A.

238,SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset: a systematic review and individual-pooled analysis of coronavirus viral load from 66 studies,"Background: Since the emergence of COVID-19, tens of millions of people have been infected, and the global death toll approached 1 million by September 2020. Understanding the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other novel human coronaviruses is imperative in designing effective control measures. Viral load contributes to the transmission potential of the virus, but findings around the temporal viral load dynamics, particularly the peak of transmission potential, remain inconsistent across studies due to limited sample sizes. Methods: We searched PubMed through June 8th 2020 and collated unique individual-patient data (IPD) from papers reporting temporal viral load and shedding data from coronaviruses. We analyzed viral load trajectories using a series of generalized additive models, and the duration of viral shedding by fitting log-normal models accounting for interval censoring. Results: We identified 115 relevant papers and obtained data from 66 (57.4%) - representing a total of 1198 patients across 14 countries. SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset and remains elevated for up to three weeks, while MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral loads peak after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV had median viral shedding durations of 4.8, 4.2, and 1.2 days after symptom onset. Disease severity, age, and specimen type all have an effect on viral load, but sex does not. Discussion: Using a pooled analysis of the largest collection of IPD on viral load to date, we are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to -- not at -- symptom onset. Detailed estimation of the trajectories of viral load and virus shedding can inform the transmission, mathematical modeling, and clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS infection.",Amy E Benefield; Laura A Skrip; Andrea Clement; Rachel A Althouse; Stewart Chang; Benjamin Muir Althouse,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20199943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202028,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
239,"Seroprevalence and Risk Factors of SARS CoV-2 in Health Care Workers of Tertiary-Care Hospitals in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","Background: High number of SARS CoV2 infected patients has overburdened healthcare delivery system, particularly in low-income countries. In the recent past many studies from the developed countries have been published on the prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies and the risk factors of COVID 19 in healthcare-workers but little is known from developing countries. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibody and risk factors for seropositivity in HCWs in tertiary care hospitals of Peshawar city, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Pakistan. Findings: The overall seroprevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies was 30.7% (CI, 27.8 to 33.6) in 1011 HCWs. Laboratory technicians had the highest seropositivity (50.0%, CI, 31.8 to 68.1). Risk analysis revealed that wearing face-mask and observing social-distancing within a family could reduce the risk (OR:0.67. p<0.05) and (OR:0.73. p<0.05) while the odds of seropositivity were higher among those attending funeral and visiting local-markets (OR:1.83. p<0.05) and (OR:1.66. p<0.01). In Univariable analysis, being a nursing staff and a paramedical staff led to higher risk of seropositivity (OR:1.58. p< 0.05), (OR:1.79. p< 0.05). Fever (OR:2.36, CI, 1.52 to 3.68) and loss of smell (OR:2.95, CI: 1.46 to 5.98) were significantly associated with increased risk of seropositivity (p<0.01). Among the seropositive HCWs, 165 (53.2%) had no symptoms at all while 145 (46.8%) had one or more symptoms. Interpretation: The high prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies in HCWs warrants for better training and use of protective measure to reduce their risk. Early detection of asymptomatic HCWs may be of special importance because they are likely to be potential threat to others during the active phase of viremia.

240,A human monoclonal antibody targeting a conserved pocket in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain core,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global outbreak of severe respiratory disease (COVID-19), leading to an unprecedented public health crisis. To date, there has been over thirty-three million diagnosed infections, and over one million deaths. No vaccine or targeted therapeutics are currently available. We previously identified a human monoclonal antibody, 47D11, capable of cross-neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and the related 2002/2003 SARS-CoV in vitro, and preventing SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia in a hamster model. Here we present the structural basis of its neutralization mechanism. We describe cryo-EM structures of trimeric SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomains in complex with the 47D11 Fab. These data reveal that 47D11 binds specifically to the closed conformation of the receptor binding domain, distal to the ACE2 binding site. The CDRL3 stabilises the N343 glycan in an upright conformation, exposing a conserved and mutationally constrained hydrophobic pocket, into which the CDRH3 loop inserts two aromatic residues. Interestingly, 47D11 preferentially selects for the partially open conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, suggesting that it could be used effectively in combination with other antibodies that target the exposed receptor-binding motif. Taken together, these results expose a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and provide a structural roadmap for the development of 47D11 as a prophylactic or post-exposure therapy for COVID-19.",Juliette Fedry; Daniel L.

241,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cell cultures by peptide-conjugated morpholino-oligomers.,"SynopsisO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and a pathogen of immense global public health importance. Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are antisense agents composed of a phosphordiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking.

Objectives and MethodsFive PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 5-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was evaluated with an ATP-based method and viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR and TCID50 infectivity assays.

ResultsPPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5-terminal region or the leader transcription regulatory sequence-region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly efficacious, reducing viral titers by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 hours post-infection, in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner.

ConclusionThe data indicate that PPMO have the ability to potently and specifically suppress SARS-CoV-2 growth and are promising candidates for further pre-clinical development.",Kyle Rosenke; Shanna Leventhal; Hong Moulton; Susan Hatlevig; David Hawman; Heinz Feldmann; David A.

242,Hallmarks of Alpha- and Betacoronavirus non-structural protein 7+8 complexes,"Coronaviruses infect many different species including humans. The last two decades have seen three zoonotic coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2 causing a pandemic in 2020. Coronaviral non-structural proteins (nsp) built up the replication-transcription complex (RTC). Nsp7 and nsp8 interact with and regulate the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and other enzymes in the RTC. However, the structural plasticity of nsp7+8 complex has been under debate. Here, we present the framework of nsp7+8 complex stoichiometry and topology based on a native mass spectrometry and complementary biophysical techniques of nsp7+8 complexes from seven coronaviruses in the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV-2. Their complexes cluster into three groups, which systematically form either heterotrimers or heterotetramers or both, exhibiting distinct topologies. Moreover, even at high protein concentrations mainly heterotetramers are observed for SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8. From these results, the different assembly paths can be pinpointed to specific residues and an assembly model is proposed.",Boris Krichel; Ganesh Bylapudi; Christina Schmidt; Clement Blanchet; Robin Schubert; Lea Brings; Martin Koehler; Renato Zenobi; Dmitri Svergun; Kristina Lorenzen; Ramakanth Madhugiri; John Ziebuhr; Charlotte Uetrecht,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.319731,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.320762,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,False
243,"BANCOVID, the first D614G variant mRNA-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 elicits neutralizing antibody and balanced cellular immune response","Effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is the utmost importance in the current world. More than 1 million deaths are accounted for relevant pandemic disease COVID-19. Recent data showed that D614G genotype of the virus is highly infectious and responsible for almost all infection for 2nd wave. Despite of multiple vaccine development initiatives, there are currently no report that has addressed this critical variant D614G as vaccine candidate. Here we report the development of an mRNA-LNP vaccine considering the D614G variant and characterization of the vaccine in preclinical trial. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data with spike protein as probe and competitive neutralization with RBD and S2 domain revealed that immunization generated specific antibody pools against the whole extracellular domain (RBD and S2) of the spike protein. The anti-sera and purified IgGs from immunized mice on day 7 and 14 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells in a dose dependent manner. Importantly, immunization protected mice lungs from pseudovirus entry and cytopathy. The immunologic responses have been implicated by a balanced and stable population of CD4+ cells with a Th1 bias. The IgG2a to IgG1 and (IgG2a+IgG2b) to (IgG1+IgG3) ratios were found 1{+/-}0.2 and 1.24{+/-}0.1, respectively. These values are comparatively higher than relevant values for other published SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in development,1, 2 and suggesting higher viral clearance capacity for our vaccine.

244,The furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key determinant for transmission due to enhanced replication in airway cells.,"SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via its spike glycoprotein which must be cleaved sequentially at the S1/S2, then the S2 cleavage sites (CS) to mediate membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 has a unique polybasic insertion at the S1/S2 CS, which we demonstrate can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with a S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion is selected for in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures but selected against in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. We find this selective advantage depends on expression of the cell surface protease, TMPRSS2, that allows virus entry independent of endosomes thus avoiding antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin CS was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals. Thus, the polybasic CS is a key determinant for efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",Thomas P. Peacock; Daniel H. Goldhill; Jie Zhou; Laury Baillon; Rebecca Frise; Olivia C.

245,Computational identification of human biological processes and protein sequence motifs putatively targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins using protein-protein interaction networks,"While the COVID-19 pandemic is causing important loss of life, knowledge of the effects of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus on human cells is currently limited. Investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between viral and host proteins can provide a better understanding of the mechanisms exploited by the virus and enable the identification of potential drug targets. We therefore performed an in-depth computational analysis of the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins in infected HEK293 cells published by Gordon et al. to reveal processes that are potentially affected by the virus and putative protein binding sites. Specifically, we performed a set of network-based functional and sequence motif enrichment analyses on SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins and on a PPI network generated by supplementing viral-host PPIs with known interactions. Using a novel implementation of our GoNet algorithm, we identified 329 Gene Ontology terms for which the SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins are significantly clustered in the network. Furthermore, we present a novel protein sequence motif discovery approach, LESMoN-Pro, that identified 9 amino acid motifs for which the associated proteins are clustered in the network.

246,Host range projection of SARS-CoV-2: South Asia perspective,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), is likely to be originated from bat and transmitted through intermediate hosts. However, the immediate source species of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. Here, we used diversity analysis of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which has been proved to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for spike protein priming. We also simulated the structure of receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 S RBD) with the ACE2s to investigate their binding affinity to determine the potential intermediate animal hosts that could spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus to humans in South Asia. We identified cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, which are predominant species in the household farming system in South Asia that can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2. All the bird species studied along with rat and mouse were considered less potential to interact with SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD and ACE2 protein complex suggests pangolin as a potential intermediate host in SARS-CoV-2.

To identify the molecular effectors that govern interferon control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a large-scale gain-of-function analysis that evaluated the impact of human interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) on viral replication. A limited subset of ISGs were found to control viral infection, including endosomal factors that inhibited viral entry, nucleic acid binding proteins that suppressed viral RNA synthesis, and a highly enriched cluster of ER and Golgi-resident ISGs that inhibited viral translation and egress. These included the type II integral membrane protein BST2/tetherin, which was found to impede viral release, and is targeted for immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 Orf7a protein. Overall, these data define the molecular basis of early innate immune control of viral infection, which will facilitate the understanding of host determinants that impact disease severity and offer potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.",Laura Martin-Sancho; Mary K Lewinski; Lars Pache; Charlotte Stoneham; XIN YIN; Dexter Pratt; Christopher Churas; Sara B Rosenthal; Sophie Liu; Paul D De Jesus; Anshu P Gounder; Courtney Nguyen; Yuan Pu; Aaron L Oom; Lisa Miorin; Ariel Rodriguez-Frandsen; Matthew Urbanowski; Megan L Shaw; Max W Chang; Christopher Benner; Matthew Frieman; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Trey Ideker; Judd F.

We propose herein to evaluate the impact of implementing conservative management as an alternative approach to surgical appendectomy in the treatment of proven acute appendicitis during COVID19 pandemic. Methods Our study is a prospective multicenter study that includes a cohort of 160 patients admitted to the surgical departments in both Tawam Hospital and Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE, for the period from February 2020 till July 2020. Results Our results showed that 56 of our patients (35%) were treated conservatively, while the other 104 (65%) underwent operative management. There was a significant decrease in length of hospital stay (LOS) (2.32 days) among the first group compared to the second (2.8 days). Also, short term follow-up showed that 90% of those patients did not require further operative intervention or developed any serious complications. Out of the 110 patients that were swapped for COVID19, nine (8.18%) were confirmed to be positive. Our protocol was to avoid surgical management for COVID19 positive patients unless indicated. This resulted in (8/9) of COVID19 positive patients to be treated conservatively. Follow up was achieved by using telemedicine-based follow-up with the aim of empowering social distancing and reducing risk of viral exposure to patients as well as the health care providers. In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of conservative management in treating patients with acute appendicitis who were COVID19 positive is a safe and feasible approach that maybe essential in reducing viral transmission risks as well as avoiding operative risks on COVID19 positive patients.",Fatima Y.

A national convenience sample of volunteers aged 18 or older was assessed between 13th April and 2nd June 2020. Flu vaccine rates were calculated for all classes of age. The association between the independent variables and the flu vaccine was assessed by applying a multivariable binary logistic regression model. Of the 198,822 respondents 41,818 (21.0%) reported to have received a flu vaccination shot during the last influenza season.

250,Performance characteristics of the VIDAS(R) SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG serological assays,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread worldwide. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies plays an important role in understanding and controlling the pandemics, notably through epidemiological surveillance. Well validated and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed. We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, EUA-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity towards sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 pre-pandemic healthy donors was [&ge;] 99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients.

251,Broad SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism and immunopathology in lung tissues from fatal COVID-19,"Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prominently manifests with pulmonary symptoms histologically reflected by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), excess inflammation, pneumocyte hyperplasia and proliferation, and formation of platelet aggregates or thromboemboli. However, the mechanisms mediating these processes remain unclear. Methods We performed multicolor staining for viral proteins, and lineage cell markers to identify SARS-CoV-2 tropism and to define the lung pathobiology in postmortem tissues from five patients with fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. Findings The lung parenchyma showed severe DAD with thromboemboli in all cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in an extensive range of cells including alveolar epithelial type II/pneumocyte type II (AT2) cells (HT2-280), ciliated cells (tyr--tubulin), goblet cells (MUC5AC), club-like cells (MUC5B) and endothelial cells (CD31 and CD34). Greater than 90% of infiltrating immune cells were positive for viral proteins including macrophages and monocytes (CD68 and CD163), neutrophils (ELA-2), natural killer (NK) cells (CD56), B-cells (CD19 and CD20), and T-cells (CD3{varepsilon}). Most but not all infected cells were positive for the viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). The numbers of infected and ACE2-positive cells correlated with the extent of tissue damage. The infected tissues exhibited low numbers of B-cells and abundant CD3{varepsilon}+ T-cells consisting of mainly T helper cells (CD4), few cytotoxic T cells (CTL, CD8), and no T regulatory cell (FOXP3).

252,SARS-CoV-2 cell entry gene ACE2 expression in immune cells that infiltrate the placenta in infection-associated preterm birth,"COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of preterm birth but neonatal infection is rare. We assessed pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 could access the placenta and contribute to fetal transmission. Placentas from pregnancies complicated with chorioamnionitis (ChA), exhibited increased expression of ACE2 mRNA. Treatment of 2nd trimester placental explants with LPS, induced an acute increase in cytokine expression followed by ACE2 mRNA. Placental ACE2 protein localized to syncytiotrophoblast, in fetal blood vessels and M1/M2 macrophage and neutrophils within the villous stroma. Increased numbers of M1 macrophage and neutrophils were present in the placenta of ChA pregnancies. Maternal peripheral immune cells (mainly granulocytes and monocytes) express the ACE2 mRNA and protein. These data suggest that in COVID19 positive pregnancies complicated by ChA, ACE2 positive immune cells have the potential to traffic SARS-CoV-2 virus to the placenta and increase the risk of vertical transmission to the placenta/fetus.",Phatcharawan Lye; Caroline Dunk; Jianhong Zhang; Yanxing Wei; Jittanan Nakpu; Hirotaka Hamada; Guinever Imperio; Enrrico Bloise; Stephen M Matthews; Stephen James Lye,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.320242,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20201590,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True

Testing specimens orthogonally using the Abbott (anti-nucleocapsid) and then the Ortho (anti-spike) assays, seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4%-1.4%, despite ongoing disease activity. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibody-positive specimens decreased over time (p=0.015), and the GMC of antibody-negative specimens increased over time (p=0.0018). The association between the two tests decreased each month (p<0.001), suggesting anti-N antibody decline.

254,High-Quality Masks Can Reduce Infections and Deaths in the US,"Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of widespread adoption of masks or face coverings to reduce community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. Methods: We employed an agent-based stochastic network simulation model, where Covid-19 progresses across census tracts according to a variant of SEIR. We considered a mask order that was initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed Covid-19 case. We evaluated scenarios where wearing a mask reduces transmission and susceptibility by 50% or 80%; an individual wears a mask with a probability of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, or 100%. Results: If 60% of the population wears masks that are 50% effective, this decreases the cumulative infection attack rate (CAR) by 25%, the peak prevalence by 51%, and the population mortality by 25%. If 100% of people wear masks (or 60% wear masks that are 80% effective), this decreases the CAR by 38%, the peak prevalence by 67%, and the population mortality by 40%.

256,Transfer transcriptomic signatures for infectious diseases,"The modulation of the transcriptome is among the earliest responses to infection, and vaccination. However, defining transcriptome signatures of disease is challenging because logistic, technical and cost factors limit the size and representativeness of samples in clinical studies. These limitations lead to poor performance of signatures when applied to new datasets or varying study settings. Using a novel approach, we leverage existing transcriptomic signatures as classifiers in unseen datasets from prospective studies, with the goal of predicting individual outcomes. Machine learning allowed the identification of sets of genes, which we name transfer transcriptomic signatures, that are predictive across diverse datasets and/or species (rhesus to humans) and that are also suggestive of activated pathways and cell type composition. We demonstrate the usefulness of transfer signatures in two use cases: progression of latent to active tuberculosis, and severity of COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 infection. The broad significance of our work lies in the concept that a small set of archetypal human immunophenotypes, captured by transfer signatures, can explain a larger set of responses to diverse diseases.",Julia di Iulio; Istvan Bartha; Roberto Spreafico; Herbert W Virgin; Amalio Telenti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204503,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203406,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
257,T cell assays differentiate clinical and subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections from cross-reactive antiviral responses,"A major issue in identification of protective T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 lies in distinguishing people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those with cross-reactive immunity generated by exposure to other coronaviruses. We characterised SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses in 168 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 118 seronegative subjects without known SARS-CoV-2 exposure using a range of T cell assays that differentially capture immune cell function. Strong ex vivo ELISpot and proliferation responses to multiple antigens (including M, NP and ORF3) were found in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were rare in pre-pandemic and unexposed seronegative subjects. However, seronegative doctors with high occupational exposure and recent COVID-19 compatible illness showed patterns of T cell responses characteristic of infection, indicating that these readouts are highly sensitive. By contrast, over 90% of convalescent or unexposed people showed proliferation and cellular lactate responses to spike subunits S1/S2, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive T cell populations. The detection of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critically dependent on the choice of assay and antigen. Memory responses to specific non-spike proteins provides a method to distinguish recent infection from pre-existing immunity in exposed populations.",Ane Ogbe; Barbara Kronsteiner; Donal T Skelly; Matthew Pace; Anthony Brown; Emily Adland; Kareena Adair; Hossain Delowar Akhter; Mohammad Ali; Serat-E Ali; Adrienn Angyal; M.

We describe the challenges and constraints in choosing a proven, scalable, and easy-to-implement decontamination solution. We discuss the heat treatment and particle filtration efficiency measurement experiments done to validate a decontamination treatment protocol at a target temperature of 70{degrees}C for a duration of 60 minutes, and the scaling up of this method using a standard hot drying cabinet at the hospital. The logistics of ensuring optimal utilization of the decontamination facility without compromising on basic safety principles are detailed. Our method relies on equipment available in standard hospitals, is simple to set-up, scalable, and can be easily replicated in low-resource settings.

Objectives To describe outcomes with high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in COVID-19 AHRF and identify individual factors associated with failure. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with HFNC and/or NIPPV to describe rates of success (live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI)), and identify characteristics associated with failure (ETI and/or in-hospital mortality) using Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models. Results A total of 331 and 747 patients received HFNC and NIPPV as the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5%) in the HFNC cohort and 167 (22.4%) in the NIPPV cohort were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06-1.84), respectively, and among those with lower oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at HFNC and NIPPV initiation (sHR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively). Conclusions A significant proportion of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory modalities for COVID-19 AHRF achieved successful discharge without requiring ETI, with lower success rates among those with cardiovascular disease or more severe hypoxia.

We highlight the existence of a latency period of around 5 weeks between the infections of young individual (generally asymptomatic) to older individuals that may have a severe form of the disease and may be hospitalized. If the overall positive detection rate provided relevant information until the end of August, since the beginning of September the overall positive detection rate has reached a plateau and no longer provides relevant information on the current state of the epidemic. We show that the incidence rate in the 70+ age group is a relevant and early indicator of the epidemic.

264,Estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh Using Exponential Growth Method,"Objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Soon, it has spread out across the world and become an ongoing pandemic. In Bangladesh, the first case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, not many significant studies have been conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. In this study, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. Methods: The data of daily confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh and the reported values of generation time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Singapore and Tianjin, China, were collected. We calculated the basic reproduction number R0 by applying the exponential growth (EG) method. Epidemic data of the first 76 days and different values of generation time were used for the calculation. Results: The basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is estimated to be 2.66 [95% CI: 2.58-2.75], optimized R0 is 2.78 [95% CI: 2.69-2.88] using generation time 5.20 with a standard deviation of 1.72 for Singapore. Using generation time 3.95 with a standard deviation of 1.51 for Tianjin, China, R0 is estimated to be 2.15 [95% CI: 2.09-2.20], optimized R0 is 2.22 [95% CI: 2.16-2.29].

265,A global omics data sharing and analytics marketplace: Case study of a rapid data COVID-19 pandemic response platform.,"Under public health emergencies, particularly an early epidemic, it is fundamental that genetic and other healthcare data is shared across borders in both a timely and accurate manner before the outbreak of a global pandemic. However, although the COVID-19 pandemic has created a tidal wave of data, most patient data is siloed, not easily accessible, and due to low sample size, largely not actionable. Based on the precision medicine platform Shivom, a novel and secure data sharing and data analytics marketplace, we developed a versatile pandemic preparedness platform that allows healthcare professionals to rapidly share and analyze genetic data. The platform solves several problems of the global medical and research community, such as siloed data, cross-border data sharing, lack of state-of-the-art analytic tools, GDPR-compliance, and ease-of-use. The platform serves as a central marketplace of 'discoverability'. The platform combines patient genomic & omics data sets, a marketplace for AI & bioinformatics algorithms, new diagnostic tools, and data-sharing capabilities to advance virus epidemiology and biomarker discovery. The bioinformatics marketplace contains some preinstalled COVID-19 pipelines to analyze virus- and host genomes without the need for bioinformatics expertise. The platform will be the quickest way to rapidly gain insight into the association between virus-host interactions and COVID-19 in various populations which can have a significant impact on managing the current pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks.",Ibrahim Farah; Giada Lalli; Darrol Baker; Axel Schumacher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20201590,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203257,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
266,Using COVID-19 deaths as a surrogate to measure the progression of the pandemics.,"The IFR (Infection Fatality Risk) is one of the most important parameters of an infectious disease. If properly estimated, the observed number of deaths divided by the IFR can be used to estimate the current number of infections and, if immunity is permanent, we can estimate the fraction of susceptible which can be used to plan reopening of activities and vaccine deployment, when these become available. Here we suggest how to use the observed deaths by COVID-19 in an arbitrary population as a surrogate for the progression of the epidemic with the purpose of decision making. We compare several estimates of IFR for SARS-CoV-2 with our estimate that uses the number of additional deaths in households in a database population of 159,150 laboratory-confirmed (RT-qPCR) COVID-19 by SARS-COV-2 in Mexico. The main result is that if the number of deaths in a region is close to 2 per thousand individuals, the fraction of remaining susceptible may be too small for the vaccine to make a difference in the total number of infected.",CARLOS M HERNANDEZ-SUAREZ; Efren Murillo-Zamora,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20200915,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202564,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
267,A steady trickle-down from metro districts and improving epidemic-parameters characterize the increasing COVID-19 cases in India,"Background. By mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India have crossed 95,000. To facilitate an intuition for the spatio-temporal development of the pandemic and to help resource deployment planning, we analyze and describe how the disease burden almost-predictably shifted from large metropolitan districts to sub-urban districts. Methods. We gathered the publicly available granular data from 186 different districts (equivalent of counties) on their COVID-19 infections and deaths during the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. These districts presented an active case burden of 559,566 and a cumulative 2,715,656 infections as of August 31. The epidemiological data of these districts was fit to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model and the underlying epidemic parameters for each of these districts during the course of 4 months was estimated. We validated these parameters against known epidemiological characteristic distributions and analyzed them to understand their changes in space-time during the pandemic. Findings. The center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with most international access shifted continuously and smoothly shifted towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in most epidemic parameters consistently across the districts with four categories of accessibility from an international travel perspective - large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77{+/-}0.58 on May 15 to 1.07{+/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58{+/-}0.39 on May 15 to 0.94{+/-}0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581{+/-}0.009 on May 15 to 0.091{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26.10^{-12}); and from 0.059{+/-}0.011 on May 15 to 0.100{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12.10{-16}). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025{+/-}0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018{+/-}0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789. Interpretation. As the daily infections continue to rise at a national level, it is important to notice a `local-flattening' in larger metro districts, and a shift of the pandemic-burden towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. The pandemic burden shifting towards remotely accessible regions, with possibly lesser health care facilities, is a call for attention to the re-organization of resources.",Santosh Ansumali; Aloke Kumar; Samarth Agrawal; H J Shashank; Meher K Prakash,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20200915,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202978,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
268,The potential contribution of face coverings to the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools and broader society in the UK: a modelling study,"Recent findings suggest that an adequate test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategy is needed to prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave with the reopening of society in the UK. Here we assess the potential importance of mandatory masks in the parts of community and in secondary schools. We show that, assuming current TTI levels, adoption of masks in secondary schools in addition to community settings can reduce the size of a second wave, but will not prevent it; more testing of symptomatic people, tracing and isolating of their contacts is also needed. To avoid a second wave, with masks mandatory in secondary schools and in certain community settings, under current tracing levels, 68% or 46% of those with symptomatic infection would need to be tested if masks' effective coverage were 15% or 30% respectively, compared to 76% and 57% if masks are mandated in community settings but not secondary schools.",Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths; Cliff C Kerr; William Waites; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Dina Mistry; Derek Foster; Daniel J Klein; Russell M Viner; Chris Bonell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20199737,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202937,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
269,Tracking WhatsApp behaviors during a crisis: A longitudinal observation of messaging activities during the COVID-19 pandemic,"During a crisis, the messaging platform WhatsApp allows crisis-related information to be disseminated quickly. Although case studies have documented how WhatsApp has shaped crisis outcomes in both beneficial and harmful ways, little is known about: (i) how crisis-related content is spread; (ii) characteristics of users based on usage patterns; or (iii) how usage patterns link to well-being. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, this study used the experience sampling method to track the daily WhatsApp usage of 151 adults throughout one week (capturing a total of 924 days of crisis-related communication). Each day, participants reported the extent to which they had received, forwarded, or discussed COVID-19- related content. During the week-long monitoring, most participants (94.7%) reported at least one COVID-19 related use of WhatsApp. Those who engaged with more COVID-19 content in personal chats were more likely to report having COVID-19 thoughts throughout the day. We further observed that around 1 in 10 individuals (14%) were chronic users who received and shared forwarded COVID-19 messages at a high volume; this group may represent everyday ""super spreaders"" of crisis-related content. Together, these findings provide an empirical base for policy makers to manage risk communication during large-scale crises.",Edina YQ Tan; Russell RE Wee; Young Ern Saw; Kylie JQ Heng; Joseph WE Chin; Eddie MW Tong; Jean CJ Liu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20199737,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203646,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
270,A Sew-Free Origami Mask for Improvised Respiratory Protection,"Recently, respiratory aerosols with diameters smaller than 100 m have been con- firmed as important vectors for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. While cloth masks afford some protection for larger ballistic droplets, they are typically inefficient at filtering these aerosols and require specialized fabrication devices to produce. We describe a fabrication technique that makes use of a folding procedure (origami) to transform a filtration material into a mask. These origami masks can be fabricated by non-experts at minimal cost and effort, provide adequate filtration efficiencies, and are easily scaled to different facial sizes. Using a mannequin fit test simulator, we demonstrate that these masks can provide optimal filtration efficiency and ease of breathing with minimal leak- age. Because this mask provides greater comfort compared to commercial alternatives, it is likely to promote greater mask wearing tolerance and acceptance.",Jonathan Realmuto; Michael T.

The adherence to the measures and evolution of the number of cases were verified during the project.MATERIALS AND METHODS.The target population consisted of approximately 1300 participants(350 families). A collection of epidemiological data was performed in family members registered for the project. Rapid tests were performed on people who had symptoms and their contacts. Scientific information through audio-visual materials,educational pamphlets written in colloquial language, food parcels,masks,hygiene and cleaning materials were provided directly to family nuclei. RESULTS The common needs faced by families were food inputs and/or ready-to-eat food, mentioned by 91.4% (233) of the people, and hygienic and cleaning materials, mentioned by 30.6% (78) of the people. Only 34.9% (84) of families had 70% rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer gel at home.The most frequently cited sources of information on COVID-19 were television [cited by 82.4% (210) of the people]; social media [25.5% (65)]; friends, neighbours, or family members [13.7% (35)]; and radio [11.4% (29)] .A total of 83.7% (175) stated that the actions helped them to avoid leaving the community.CONCLUSIONS Community isolation may be the best way to contain the spread of pandemics in fragile populations with low socio-economic status.Educational actions combined with rapid testing and humanitarian aid were objective forms to promote community isolation.",valderilio F azevedo; leiticia chaffin Barbosa Peruffo; Gabriel mondin Nogueira; faissal Nemer hajar; guilherme kyuzaemon Osako Novakoski; leonardo krieger rafael; ricardo gomes de Oliveira Brugnari; Lorena Egashira Vanzela; Simone de Bittencourt Larocca,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204115,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203174,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
272,Efficacy of face-masks used in Uganda: a laboratory-based inquiry during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background With shortages of face-masks continuing to be reported worldwide, critical questions like whether or not there is an adequate alternative to commercially manufactured face-masks continue to linger especially in low- and middle- income settings. This study aimed at addressing this through testing and comparing various materials and forms of face-masks for filtration efficiency, breathability, microbial cleanliness, distance-dependent fitness, and re-usability of different face-masks procured from face-mask vendors in Kampala, Uganda. Methods This was a laboratory-based descriptive study that applied new protocols and already existing protocols with substantive modifications to ten different types of face-mask types each in quadruplicate to achieve each specified aim. Results Surgical face-masks had better filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other face-masks tested. Decontamination of these face-masks with 70% ethanol negatively affected their efficacy. Locally-made double layered face-masks had better: filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other locally-made cloth face-masks, and re-usability compared to all the face-mask types that had been tested.

273,Impact of stopping therapy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in persons with lymphoma,"Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic disrupted medical care for persons with cancer including those with lymphoma. Many professional societies recommend postponing, decreasing or stopping anti-cancer therapy in selected persons during the pandemic. However, although seemingly sensible these recommendations are not evidence-based and their impact on anxiety and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) is unknown. Methods: Surveyed 2532 subjects including 1060 persons with lymphoma, 948 caregivers and 524 normal, uninvolved persons using a purposed-designed questionnaire on a patient organization website. Respondents also completed the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety and patient respondents, the EORTC QLQ-C30 instruments to quantify anxiety and HRQoL. We also evaluated caregiver support and an online education programme of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO). Data of HRQoL from a 2019 pre-pandemic online survey of 1106 persons with lymphoma was a control. Results: 33% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 30, 36%) of lymphoma patients and 31% (28, 34%) of caregivers but only 21% (17, 24%) of normal individuals had any level of anxiety (both pair-wise P < 0.001). Amongst lymphoma respondents physical exercise and better caregiver support were associated with less anxiety whereas female sex, receiving therapy and reduced therapy intensity were associated with more anxiety. Paradoxically, lymphoma respondents during the pandemic had better HRQoL than pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy intensity was associated with worse HRQoL whereas respondents who scored caregiver support and the online patient education programme high had better HRQoL. Conclusions: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lymphoma patients and their caregivers had significantly higher incidence of anxiety compared with normals. Lymphoma respondents reported better HRQoL compared with pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy-intensity in patients with cancer may have unanticipated adverse effects on anxiety and HRQoL. Regular and intense support by caregivers and online education programmes alleviate anxiety and improve HRQoL.",Shenmiao Yang; Dong Dong; Hongfei Gu; Robert Peter Gale; Jun Ma; Xiaojun Huang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203174,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203083,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
274,"Seroprevalence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers and administration employees: a prospective surveillance study at a 1,400-bed university hospital in Germany","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at particular risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections. Aim: The objectives of this study were to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence and compliance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) between HCWs working within (high-risk) or outside (intermediate-risk) units treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In addition, administration staff (low-risk) was included. Materials: Co-HCW is a prospective cohort study among employees at the Jena University Hospital, Germany. Since 16th March 2020, 50 SARS-CoV-2 inpatients and 73 outpatients were treated in our hospital. Mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We here evaluated seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays, assessed COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Findings: Between 19th May and 19th June 2020 we analysed 660 employees [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Eighteen participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Among them, 13 (72.2%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (50.0%) did not report any clinical symptoms. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and risk area (high-risk: 2 of 137 HCWs (1.5%), intermediate-risk: 10 of 343 HCWs (2.9%), low-risk: 6 of 180 administration employees (3.3%); p=0.574). Reported compliance to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). Conclusion: No evidence for higher seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in high-risk COVID-19 areas could be observed, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE.

276,Comparison of infection control strategies to reduce COVID-19 outbreaks in homeless shelters in the United States: a simulation study,"Background: Multiple COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US, highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent future outbreaks. Objective: To estimate the probability of averting outbreaks in homeless shelters under different infection control strategies. Design: Microsimulation model of COVID-19 transmission in a representative homeless shelter over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and universal mask wearing. Setting: A shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff. Patients: Residents and staff of homeless shelters in the US. Model calibrated to data from cross-sectional PCR surveys during COVID-19 outbreaks in five shelters in three US cities. Measurements: Probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak ([&ge;]3 infections in 14 days). Results: Basic reproduction number (R0) estimates for the observed outbreaks ranged from 2.9 to 6.2. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing transmission intensity in the local community. With moderate transmission intensity in the local community, the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0=1.5), moderate-risk (R0=2.9), and high-risk (R0=6.2) shelter were: 0.33, 0.11 and 0.03 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.52, 0.27, and 0.04 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.47, 0.20 and 0.06 for universal masking; and 0.68, 0.40 and 0.08 for these strategies combined. Limitations: R0 values calibrated to reported outbreaks may be higher than for average shelter due to smaller outbreaks going unreported. Conclusion: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19 most infection control strategies are unlikely to prevent outbreaks. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be adopted to reduce outbreak risk.

Here we explore the potential for using sebum, collected via swabbing of a patient's skin, as a novel sampling matrix to fulfil these requirements. In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 PCR positive and 37 PCR negative). Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Total fatty acid derivative levels were found to be depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) modelling showed promising separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants when comorbidities and medication were controlled for.

278,De Novo Discovery of High Affinity Peptide Binders for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein,"The {beta}-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Affinity reagents targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the most exposed surface structure of the virus, are of interest for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. We used affinity selection-mass spectrometry for the rapid discovery of synthetic high affinity peptide binders for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. From library screening with 800 million synthetic peptides, we identified three sequences with nanomolar affinities (dissociation constants Kd = 80 to 970 nM) for RBD and selectivity over human serum proteins. Picomolar RBD concentrations in biological matrix could be detected using the biotinylated lead peptide in ELISA format. These peptides might associate with the SARS-CoV-2-spike-RBD at a site unrelated to ACE2 binding, making them potential orthogonal reagents for sandwich immunoassays. We envision our discovery as a robust starting point for the development of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics or conjugates for virus directed delivery of therapeutics.

279,Brief communication: A meta-analysis of randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of COVID-19,"Background: Recruitment into randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for prevention of COVID-19 is being threatened by a widespread conviction that HCQ is not effective for prevention. In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19. Methods and Findings: A search of PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv with expert consultation found four completed randomized trials: two pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and two post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. The risk ratio estimated for each of the individual trials were 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-1.10), 0.95 (0.25, 3.64), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-1.18), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35-1.37). The pooled risk ratio estimate was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61-0.99) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random effects approach, and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.53-1.16) when using a conservative modification of the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach. All four trials found a similar rate of serious adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups. Discussion: A pooled analysis of these randomized trials cannot rule out a moderate reduction of COVID-19 risk after assignment to HCQ. Yet the findings from the randomized trials were widely interpreted as definite evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ, simply because they were not statistically significant. Completion of the ongoing trials is needed to generate more precise estimates of the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.",Xabier Garcia-Albeniz; Julia Del Amo; Rosa Polo; Jose Miguel Morales Asencio; Miguel A Hernan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203737,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203869,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True
280,Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria: adjusting for misclassification,"We present a method for adjusting the observed epidemic curve of daily new COVID-19 onsets for possible misclassification in infection diagnostics. We discuss different assumptions for specificity and sensitivity of the person-specific COVID-19 diagnostics based on PCR-tests, which are the basis for the daily reported case counts. A specificity of less than one implies occurrence of false positive cases, which becomes particularly relevant with an increased number of tests. The recent increase in cases in Bavaria could therefore be smaller than reported. However, an increase in case counts can still be seen from Mid-July until September 2020. The additional consideration of a sensitivity less than one, i.e., the occurrence of false negative tests, results in an epidemic curve in which the daily case counts are increased by a constant factor, but the structure of the curve does not change considerably.",Felix Guenther; Andreas Bender; Michael Höhle; Manfred Wildner; Helmut Küchenhoff,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203695,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203877,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,True

In the present study, public health database from the Algeria health ministry has been used to train and test the ELM models. The input parameters for the predictive models include Cumulative Confirmed COVID-19 Cases (CCCC), Calculated COVID-19 New Cases (CCNC), and Index Day (ID). The predictive accuracy of the seven models has been assessed via several statistical parameters. The results showed that the proposed ELM model achieved an adequate level of prediction accuracy with smallest errors (MSE= 0.16, RMSE=0.4114, and MAE= 0.2912), and highest performances (NSE = 0.9999, IO = 0.9988, R2 = 0.9999).

282,Causal Analysis of Health Interventions and Environments for Influencing the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States of America,"As of August 27, 2020, the number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in the US exceeded 5,863,363 and included 180,595 deaths, thus causing a serious public health crisis. Curbing the spread of Covid-19 is still urgently needed. Given the lack of potential vaccines and effective medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major option to curtail the spread of COVID-19. An accurate estimate of the potential impact of different non-pharmaceutical measures on containing, and identify risk factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for planning the most effective interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to reduce the deaths. Additive model-based bivariate causal discovery for scalar factors and multivariate Granger causality tests for time series factors are applied to the surveillance data of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US, University of Maryland Data (UMD) data, and Google mobility data from March 5, 2020 to August 25, 2020 in order to evaluate the contributions of social-biological factors, economics, the Google mobility indexes, and the rate of the virus test to the number of the new cases and number of deaths from COVID-19. We found that active cases/1000 people, workplaces, tests done/1000 people, imported COVID-19 cases, unemployment rate and unemployment claims/1000 people, mobility trends for places of residence (residential), retail and test capacity were the most significant risk factor for the new cases of COVID-19 in 23, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1 and 1 states, respectively, and that active cases/1000 people, workplaces, residential, unemployment rate, imported COVID cases, unemployment claims/1000 people, transit stations, mobility trends (transit) , tests done/1000 people, grocery, testing capacity, retail, percentage of change in consumption, percentage of working from home were the most significant risk factor for the deaths of COVID-19 in 17, 10, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 states, respectively. We observed that no metrics showed significant evidence in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in FL and only a few metrics showed evidence in reducing the number of new cases of COVID-19 in AZ, NY and TX.

283,Prime-boost vaccination of mice and Rhesus macaques with two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates,"COVID-19 vaccines are being developed urgently worldwide, among which single-shot adenovirus vectored vaccines represent a major approach. Here, we constructed two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates on simian adenovirus serotype 23 (Sad23L) and human adenovirus serotype 49 vectors (Ad49L) carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), designated Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively. The immunogenicity elicited by these two vaccine strains was individually evaluated in mice. Specific humoral and cellular immune responses were proportionally observed in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger response was obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected with a dose of 5x109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine for prime vaccination, followed by boosting with 5x109 PFU of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine at 4-week interval. Three macaques were injected with Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP vectorial viruses as negative controls. Both mice and macaques tolerated well the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost vaccination regimen induced high titers of 103.16 S-binding antibody (S-BAb), 102.75 cell receptor binding domain (RBD)-BAb and 102.38 neutralizing antibody (NAb) to pseudovirus a week after boosting injection, followed by sustained high levels over 10 weeks of observation. Robust IFN-{gamma} secreting T-cell response (712.6 SFCs/106 cells), IL-2 secreting T-cell response (334 SFCs/106 cells) and intracellular IFN-{gamma} expressing CD4+/CD8+ T cell response (0.39%/0.55%) to S peptides were detected in the vaccinated macaques.

284,Susceptibility of midge and mosquito vectors to SARS-CoV-2 by natural route of infection,"SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged, highly contagious virus and the cause of the current pandemic. It is a zoonotic virus, although its animal origin is not clear yet. Person-to-person transmission occurs by inhalation of infected droplets and aerosols, or by direct contact with contaminated fomites. Arthropods transmit numerous viral, parasitic, and bacterial diseases; however, the potential role of arthropods in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not fully understood. Thus far, a few studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not supported in cells from certain insect species nor in certain species of mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation. In this study, we expanded the work of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to biting insects after ingesting a SARS-CoV-2infected blood meal. Species tested included Culicoides sonorensis biting midges, as well as Culex tarsalis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, all known biological vectors for numerous RNA viruses. Arthropods were allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2 spiked blood and at various time points post infection analyzed for the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Additionally, cell lines derived from C. sonorensis (W8a), Ae. aegypti (C6/36), Cx. quinquefasciatus (HSU), and Cx. tarsalis (CxTrR2) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Our results indicate that none of the biting insects, nor the insect cell lines support SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conclude, that biting insect do not pose a risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans or animals following a SARS-CoV-2 infected blood meal.",Velmurugan Balaraman; Barbara S.

285,SARS-CoV-2 D614G Variant Exhibits Enhanced Replication ex vivo and Earlier Transmission in vivo,"The D614G substitution in the S protein is most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating globally, but its effects in viral pathogenesis and transmission remain unclear. We engineered SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring the D614G substitution with or without nanoluciferase. The D614G variant replicates more efficiency in primary human proximal airway epithelial cells and is more fit than wildtype (WT) virus in competition studies. With similar morphology to the WT virion, the D614G virus is also more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Infection of human ACE2 transgenic mice and Syrian hamsters with the WT or D614G viruses produced similar titers in respiratory tissue and pulmonary disease. However, the D614G variant exhibited significantly faster droplet transmission between hamsters than the WT virus, early after infection. Our study demonstrated the SARS-CoV2 D614G substitution enhances infectivity, replication fitness, and early transmission.",Yixuan J Hou; Shiho Chiba; Peter Halfmann; Camille Ehre; Makoto Kuroda; Kenneth H Dinnon III; Sarah R Leist; Alexandra Schäfer; Noriko Nakajima; Kenta Takahashi; Rhianna E Lee; Teresa M Mascenik; Caitlin E Edwards; Longping V Tse; Richard C Boucher; Scott H Randell; Tadaki Suzuki; Lisa E Gralinski; Yoshihiro Kawaoka; Ralph S.

286,"COVID-19 in Portugal: predictability ofhospitalization, ICU and respiratory-assistance needs","The current SARS-COV-2 epidemic is associated with nearly 1 million estimated deaths and responsible for multiple disturbances around the world, including the overload of health care systems. The timely prediction of the medical needs of infected individuals enables a better and quicker care provision for the necessary cases, supporting the management of available resources. This work ascertains the predictability of medical needs (as hospitalization, respiratory support, and admission to intensive care units) and the survivability of individuals testing SARS-CoV-2 positive considering a cohort with all infected individuals in Portugal as per June 30, 2020. Predictions are performed at the various stages of a patients cycle, namely: pre-hospitalization (testing time), pos-hospitalization, and pos-intensive care. A thorough optimization of state-of-the-art predictors is undertaken to assess the ability to anticipate medical needs and infection outcomes using demographic and comorbidity variables, as well as onset date of symptoms, test and hospitalization.",Andre Patricio; Rafael S.

287,Probabilistic analysis of COVID-19 patients' individual length of stay in Swiss intensive care units,"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic induces considerable strain on intensive care unit resources. Objectives: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients' intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. Methods: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. Measurements: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. Main Results: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. Conclusion: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early. The model may be the basis to simulate stochastic models for bed occupation in intensive care units under different casemix scenarios.",Alexander Henzi; Gian-Reto Kleger; Matthias P. Hilty; Pedro D.

288,Functional immunoparalysis characterized by elevated Interleukin-10 and Interleukin-10-to-Lymphocyte Count Ratio is associated with severe disease and poor outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Objectives: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a dysregulated immune state, called cytokine storm. While research has focused on the hyperinflammation, little research has been performed on the compensatory anti-inflammatory response which if severe may lead to a state of functional immunoparalysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory response to COVID-19, by assessing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-10/lymphocyte count ratio and their association with patient outcomes. Methods: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was peak COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. Additional endpoints included COVID-19 severity at ED disposition, development of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) or secondary bacterial infections. Results: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease at both time points (all p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe AKI and secondary bacterial infection (all p[&le;]0.01). In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in IL-10 was associated with 42% increased odds of severe COVID-19 (p=0.031), whilst a one-unit increase IL-10/lymphocyte ratio was also associated with 32% increase in odds of severe COVID-19 (p=0.013). Conclusions: The hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is accompanied by a simultaneous anti-inflammatory response, which is associated with poor outcomes and may increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte ratio at ED presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity.

289,"Design, expression, purification and characterization of a YFP-tagged 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain construct","2019-nCoV is the causative agent of the serious, still ongoing, worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. High quality recombinant virus proteins are required for research related to the development of vaccines and improved assays, and to the general understanding of virus action. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the 2019-nCoV spike (S) protein contains disulfide bonds and N-linked glycosylations, therefore, it is typically produced by secretion. Here, we describe a construct and protocol for the expression and purification of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) labeled 2019-nCoV spike RBD. The fusion protein, in the vector pcDNA 4/TO, comprises an N-terminal interferon alpha 2 (IFN2) signal peptide, an eYFP, a FLAG-tag, a human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV spike protein and a C-terminal 8x His-tag. We stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Following expansion of the cells, the fusion protein was secreted from adherent cells into serum-free medium. Ni-NTA IMAC purification resulted in very high protein purity, based on analysis by SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein was soluble and monodisperse, as confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and negative staining electron microscopy. Deglycosylation experiments confirmed the presence of N-linked glycosylations in the secreted protein. Complex formation with the peptidase domain of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for the 2019-nCoV spike RBD, was confirmed by SEC, both for the YFP-fused spike RBD and for spike RBD alone, after removal of YFP by proteolytic cleavage. Possible applications for the fusion protein include binding studies on cells or in vitro, fluorescent labeling of potential virus-binding sites on cells, the use as an antigen for immunization studies or as a tool for the development of novel virus- or antibody-detection assays.",Tobias Bierig; Gabriella Collu; Alain Blanc; Emiliya Poghosyan; Roger Marc Benoit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203869,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.318196,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,,False
290,Temporal Changes in Clinical Practice with COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients: Potential Explanations for Better In-Hospital Outcomes,"Background/Aims: We reviewed demographic and clinical profiles, along with measures of hospital-based clinical practice to identify temporal changes in clinical practice that may have affected in-hospital outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Data consisted of sociodemographic and clinical data captured in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) electronic medical record (EMR) systems, linked by common variables (deidentified). The analysis population included hospitalized patients (across 21 hospitals) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection during the period March 14-August 31, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mechanical ventilation/mortality. We compared temporal trends in patient characteristics, clinical practice, and hospital outcomes using 4 time-defined epochs for calendar year 2020: March 14-March 31 (epoch 1); April 1-May 15, (epoch 2), May 16-June 28 (epoch 3); and June 29-August 31 (epoch 4). We report unadjusted survival estimates, followed by propensity score analyses to adjust for differences in patient characteristics, to compare in-hospital outcomes of epoch 4 patients (recently treated) to epoch 1-3 patients (earlier treated). Results: Mean number of hospital admissions was 9.9 per day during epoch 4, which was ~2- to 3-fold higher than the earlier epochs. Presenting characteristics of the 1,076 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were similar across the 4 epochs, including mean age. The crude rate of mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (17%) than in epoch 1-3 patients (23% to 35%). When censoring for incomplete patient follow-up, the rate of mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (p<0.0001), as was the individual component of mechanical ventilation (p=0.0002) and mortality (p=0.02). In propensity score adjusted analyses, the in-hospital relative risk (RR) of mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.93). For the outcome being discharged alive within 3, 5, or 7 days of admission, adjusted odds ranged from 1.6- to 1.7-fold higher among epoch 4 patients compared to earlier treated patients. The better outcomes in epoch 4 patients were principally observed in patients under the age of 75 years. Patient level dexamethasone use was 55.6% in epoch 4 compared to 15% or less of patients in the earlier epochs. Most patients across epochs received anticoagulation drugs (principally heparin). Overall steroid (81.7% vs. 54.3%, p<0.0001) and anticoagulation use (90.4% vs. 80.7%, p=0.0001) was more frequent on the day or day after hospitalization in epoch 4 patients compared to earlier treated patients. Conclusions: In our large system, recently treated hospitalized COVID-19 patients had lower rates of in-hospital mechanical ventilation/mortality and shorter length of hospital stay. Alongside of this was a change to early initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and anticoagulation.

Onehundred and sixty-ninepatients were recruited from January 27 to March 17, 2020 at five hospitals in Hubei and Guangxi. Theywere divided into four groups according to age and into two groups according to presence ofcomorbidities. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed for the prognosis of the disease. Fifty-two patients (30.8%) had comorbidities, and the percentage of critical COVID-19was higher in the comorbidities group (11.6%vs.0.9%, p<0.05). Older patients had higher proportion of severe or critical disease.The resultsshowed that lymphocyte count was significantly associated with thenumber ofdays from positive COVID-19 nucleic acid testto negative test; number of days from onset of symptoms to confirmation of diagnosis was significantly associated with the time it took forsymptoms to improve; andnumber of days from onset of symptomsto confirmation of diagnosis and disease severity were significantly associated withchest computed tomography improvement.

292,The quantitative landscape of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,"Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) appear promising interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over 100 NAbs have been identified so far and several are in clinical trials. Yet, which NAbs would be the most potent remains unclear. Here, we analysed reported in vitro dose-response curves (DRCs) of >70 NAbs and estimated corresponding 50% inhibitory concentrations, slope parameters, and instantaneous inhibitory potentials (IIPs), presenting a comprehensive quantitative landscape of NAb responses to SARS-CoV-2. NAbs with high IIPs are likely to be potent. To assess the applicability of the landscape in vivo, we analysed available DRCs of NAbs from individual patients and found that the responses closely resembled the landscape. Further, we created virtual patient plasma samples by randomly sampling NAbs from the landscape and found that they recapitulated plasma dilution assays from convalescent patients. The landscape thus offers a facile tool for benchmarking NAbs and would aid the development of NAb-based therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Pranesh Padmanabhan; Rajat Desikan; Narendra M Dixit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203299,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201996,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
293,"Improved Sensitivity, Safety, and Rapidity of COVID-19 Tests by Replacing Viral Storage Solution with Lysis Buffer","Conducting numerous, rapid, and reliable PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for our ability to monitor and control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1{+/-}0.6 (Mean{+/-}SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed.",Oran Erster; Omer Shkedi; Gil Benedek; Eyal Zilber; Itay Varkovitzky; Rachel Shirazi; Dorit Oriya Shorka; Yuval Cohen; Tzahi Bar; Rafi Yechieli; Michal Tepperberg Oikawa; Dana Venkert; Michal Linial; Esther Oiknine-Djian; Michal Mandelboim; Zvi Livneh; Gilat Shenhav-Saltzman; Ella Mendelson; Dana Wolf; Moran Szwarcwort-Cohen; Orna Mor; Yair Lewis; Danny Zeevi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203299,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201921,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
294,Evolution of COVID-19 cases in selected low- and middle-income countries: past the herd immunity peak?,"COVID 19 cases have peaked and declined rapidly in many low and middle income countries (LMICs) in recent months, in some cases after control measures were relaxed. For 11 such countries, the hypothesis that these countries have reached herd immunity warrants serious consideration. The Reed Frost model, perhaps the simplest description for the evolution of cases in an epidemic, with only a few constant parameters, fits the observed case data remarkably well, and yields parameter values that are reasonable. The model results give infection rates of 45% and 79%, above the herd immunity thresholds for each country (under current social distancing conditions). Reproduction numbers range between 1.4 and 2.0, indicating that epidemic curves were flattened but not suppressed. Between 0.05% and 2.86% of cases have been detected according to the estimates; values which are consistent with findings from serological and T-cell immunity studies. Overall infection fatality ratios for two of three countries studied are lower than expected from reported infection fatality ratios by age (which are based on studies of several high income countries). COVID 19 may have lower age specific fatality risks in some countries, due to differences in immune-response, prior exposure to coronaviruses, disease characteristics or other factors. We find that the herd immunity hypothesis would not have fit the evolution of reported cases in several European countries, even just after the initial peaks; and subsequent resurgences of cases obviously prove that those countries have infection rates well below herd immunity levels. Our hypothesis that the 11 countries we studied have reached herd immunity should now be tested further, through serological and T cell immunity studies.",Axel S Lexmond; Carlijn JA Nouwen; Othmane Fourtassi; John Paul Callan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20203505,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20201814,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True

In order to provide an effective strategy, here we propose a control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals' propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision makers to find optimal lockdown and exit strategy for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized.

The quantification of COVID-19 transmissibility is desired for purposes of assessing the potential for a place to start an outbreak and the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures. It is well known that the transmissibility can be measured by reproduction number. For this reason, the large amount of research focuses on the estimations of reproduction number of COVID-19. However, these previous results are controversial and even misleading. To alleviate this problem, Liu et al advised to use averaging technique. Unfortunately, the fluctuant consequence principally arises from data error or model limitations rather than stochastic noise, where the averaging technique doesn't work well.

297,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies among Danish and Swedish Falck emergency and non-emergency healthcare workers,"Background: Knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak is still sparse especially in a cross-national setting. COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers and evaluating whether certain job functions is associated with a higher risk of being infected, and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that the employees meet during a workday. Finally, we will investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. Methods: A bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3,272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from June 22, 2020 until August 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Of the 3,272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity, and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group.

300,Sleep apnoea is a risk factor for severe COVID-19,"Objective: To investigate if obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19. To examine whether the risk for contracting COVID-19 is elevated among OSA patients. Design and setting: Registry based retrospective case-control study using Finnish nationwide health registries and the FinnGen Study cohort. Participants: Information regarding OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection was extracted from the FinnGen study (N=260,405) with a total of 305 patients who had a recorded PCR-validated COVID-19 infection including 26 (8.5%) individuals who were also OSA patients. Severe COVID-19 (N=83, 27.2%) was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization. Among the hospitalized individuals there were 16 (19.3%) with OSA diagnosis. In addition, we also included in our analysis previously reported risk factors for both severe COVID-19 or risk factors and comorbidities for OSA from FinnGen. Main outcome measures: OSA diagnosis, information concerning COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization, were derived from Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry, Causes of Death Registry and the National Infectious Diseases Registry. Results: We show that OSA is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization independent from age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (p-unadjusted=1.04x10^-4, OR-adjusted=5.24 [95%CI 1.33 to 23.43], p-adjusted=0.022). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.49). Conclusion: While an OSA patients risk of contracting COVID-19 is the same as non-OSA individuals, the OSA patients have a five-fold risk to be hospitalized when affected by COVID-19 than non-OSA individuals. Our findings suggest that, in assessment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, OSA needs to be recognized as one of the comorbidity risk factors for developing a severe form of the disease.",Satu Strausz; Tuomo Kiiskinen; Martin Broberg; Sanni Ruotsalainen; Jukka Koskela; Adel Bachour; Aarno Palotie; Tuula Palotie; Samuli Ripatti; Hanna M Ollila,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202051,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202051,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
301,Excess Risk of COVID-19 to University Populations Resulting from In-Person Sporting Events,"Background: One of the consequences of COVID-19 has been the cancelation of in-person collegiate sporting events. We explore the impact of having in-person sports on COVID-19 transmission on a college campus, specifically the excess cases within the campus community can be anticipated. Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model representing the interactions between the university community, we model the impact of transient influxes of visitors attending sporting events and ancillary activities (bars, dining out, etc.). We consider a number of scenarios, varying the extent to which visitors interact with the campus, the number of infectious visitors, and the extent to which the campus has controlled COVID-19 absent events. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, exploring the model's outcomes over a wide range of uncertainty. Results: Events caused an increase in the number of cases among the campus community, ranging from a 25% increase in a scenario where the campus already had an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had a low prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed lightly with the campus community to an 822% increase where the campus had controlled their COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had both a high prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed heavily with the campus community. The model was insensitive to parameter uncertainty, save for the duration a symptomatic individual was infectious. Conclusion: In-person sporting events represent a threat to the health of the campus community. This is the case even in circumstances where COVID-19 seems controlled both on-campus and among the larger population visitors are drawn from.",Stephanie S Johnson; Katelin C Jackson; Matthew S Mietchen; Samir Sbai; Elissa J Schwartz; Eric Lofgren,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202051,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202499,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
302,Trajectory of COVID-19 epidemic in Europe,"The classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model formulated by Kermack and McKendrick assumes that all individuals in the population are equally susceptible to infection. From fitting such a model to the trajectory of mortality from COVID-19 in 11 European countries up to 4 May 2020 Flaxman et al. concluded that ""major non-pharmaceutical interventions -- and lockdowns in particular -- have had a large effect on reducing transmission"". We show that relaxing the assumption of homogeneity to allow for individual variation in susceptibility or connectivity gives a model that has better fit to the data and more accurate 14-day forward prediction of mortality. Allowing for heterogeneity reduces the estimate of ""counterfactual"" deaths that would have occurred if there had been no interventions from 3.2 million to 262,000, implying that most of the slowing and reversal of COVID-19 mortality is explained by the build-up of herd immunity. The estimate of the herd immunity threshold depends on the value specified for the infection fatality ratio (IFR): a value of 0.3% for the IFR gives 15% for the average herd immunity threshold.",Marco Colombo; Joseph Mellor; Helen M Colhoun; M.

303,SARS-CoV-2 Uses CD4 to Infect T Helper Lymphocytes,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent of a major global outbreak of respiratory tract disease known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects the lungs and may cause several immune-related complications such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm which are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality . The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction is not fully understood. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4+ T helper cells, but not CD8+ T cells, and is present in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells in a mechanism that also requires ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Once inside T helper cells, SARS-CoV-2 assembles viral factories, impairs cell function and may cause cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infected T helper cells express higher amounts of IL-10, which is associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may explain the poor adaptive immune response of many COVID- 19 patients.",Gustavo G. Davanzo; Ana C. Codo; Natalia S. Brunetti; Vinciusi O.

304,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG at the epidemic peak in French Guiana,"Background SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies are crucial for clarifying dynamics in affected countries and determining the route that has already been achieved towards herd immunity. While Latin America has been heavily affected by the pandemic, only a few seroprevalence studies have been conducted there. Methods A cross-sectional survey was performed between 15 July 2020 and 23 July 2020 in 4 medical biology laboratories and 5 health centers of French Guiana, representing a period shortly after the epidemic peak. Samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG directed against domain S1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Euroimmun. Results The overall seroprevalence was 15.4% [9.3%-24.4%] among 480 participants, ranging from 4.0% to 25.5% across the different municipalities. The seroprevalence did not differ according to gender (p=0.19) or age (p=0.51). Among SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, we found that 24.6% [11.5%-45.2%] reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

305,"Clinical Course And Risk Factors For In-hospital Death In Critical COVID-19 In Wuhan, China","BACKGROUND The risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 classified as critical type have not been well described. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to described the clinical outcomes and further explored risk factors of in-hospital death for COVID-19 classified as critical type. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. From February 5, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 98 consecutive patients classified as critical COVID-19 were included in Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The final date of follow-up was March 29, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS Of the 98 patients, 43 (43.9%) died in hospital, 37(37.8%) discharged, and 18(18.4%) remained in hospital. The mean age was 68.5 (63, 75) years, and 57 (58.2%) were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (68.4%), followed by diabetes (17.3%), angina pectoris (13.3%). Except the sex (Female: 68.8% vs 49.1%, P=0.039) and angina pectoris (20.9% vs 7.3%, P = 0.048), there was no difference in other demographics and comorbidities between non-survivor and survivor groups. The proportion of elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer and cardiac injury marker were 59.4%, 35.7%, 87.5% and 42.9%, respectively, and all showed the significant difference between two groups. The acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were observed in 42.9%, 27.8% and 26.5% of the patients. Compared with survivor group, non-survivor group had more acute cardiac injury (79.1% vs 14.5%, P<0.0001), AKI (50.0% vs 10.9%, P<0.0001), and ARDS (37.2% vs 18.2%, P=0.034). Multivariable Cox regression showed increasing hazard ratio of in-hospital death associated with acute cardiac injury (HR, 6.57 [95% CI, 1.89-22.79]) and AKI (HR, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.15-5.86]).

306,"A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Pregnancy and COVID-19: Signs and Symptoms, Laboratory Tests and Perinatal Outcomes","Background: COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Objective: We aimed to investigate the clinical manifestation include signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed via LitCovid hub, Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences, and Google scholar on 07 April 2020. Meta-analysis was performed via CMA software using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The event rate with 95% CI was calculated for each variable. Results: Ten studies were selected. The pooled prevalence for fever, post-partum fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, sore throat, and diarrhea were 66.8 %, 37.1 %, 35.5 %, 24.6 %, 14.9%, 14.6 %, 11.5%, and 7.6 %, respectively. Laboratory test results were 49.8 % for lymphopenia, 47.7 % for leukocytosis, 83.7 % for elevated neutrophil ratio, 57 % for elevated C-reactive protein, and 71.4 % for decreased lymphocyte ratio. The rate of cesarean section for delivery in all cases was 84%. Only one case was the newborn of a mother with COVID-19 positive. Also, there was only one death due to Decreased lymphocyte ratio. Conclusion: Fever was the most common signs and symptoms in pregnant women with COVID-19. Among the laboratory tests, the highest amount was related to elevated neutrophil ratio.

307,Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review,"Objective This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 Methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. Eligible studies were randomised trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository maintained through regular searches in electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardised form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included 3 randomised trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large reduction in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence). Conclusions The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions about the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is not possible to balance the potential benefits, if any, with the adverse effects and costs.

Complete blood count changes, including new cell activation parameters, from 982 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients from 11 European hospitals were retrospectively analysed for distinctive patterns based on age, gender, clinical severity, symptom duration and hospital days. The observed haemocytometric patterns formed the basis to develop a multi-haemocytometric-parameter prognostic score to predict, during the first three days after presentation, which patients will recover without ventilation or deteriorate within a two-week timeframe, needing intensive care or with fatal outcome. The prognostic score, with ROC curve AUC at baseline of 0.753 (95% CI 0.723-0.781) increasing to 0.875 (95% CI 0.806-0.926) on day 3, was superior to any individual parameter at distinguishing between clinical severity.

310,"Strong impact of closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks during the Covid-19 pandemic: results from a simple and revealing analysis","Many complex mathematical and epidemiological methods have been used to model the Covid-19 pandemic. Among other results from these models has been the view that closing schools had little impact on infection rates in several countries1. We took a different approach. Making one assumption, we simply plotted cases, hospitalizations and deaths, on a log2 Y axis and a linear date-based X axis, and analyzed them using segmented regression, a powerful method that has largely been overlooked during this pandemic. Here we show that the data fit straight lines with correlation coefficients ranging from 92% - 99%, and that these lines broke at interesting intervals, revealing that school closings dropped infection rates in half, lockdowns dropped the rates 3 to 4 fold, and other actions (such as closing bars and mandating masks) brought the rates even further down. Hospitalizations and deaths paralleled cases, with lags of three to ten days. The graphs, which are easy to read, reveal changes in infection rates that are not obvious using other graphing methods, and have several implications for modeling and policy development during this and future pandemics. Overall, other than full lockdowns, three interventions had the most impact: closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks: a message easily understood by the public.",Polly Matzinger; Jeff Skinner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20189522,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202457,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True

All three deadly CoVs originated from bats, the natural hosts, and transmitted to humans via various intermediate animal reservoirs. Because there is currently no universal pan-Coronavirus vaccine available, two worst-case scenarios remain highly possible: (1) SARS-CoV-2 mutates and transforms into a seasonal ""flu-like"" global pandemic; and/or (2) Other global COVID-like pandemics will emerge in the coming years, caused by yet another spillover of an unknown zoonotic bat-derived SARS-like Coronavirus (SL-CoV) into an unvaccinated human population. Determining the antigen and epitope landscapes that are conserved among human and animal Coronaviruses as well as the repertoire, phenotype and function of B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that correlate with resistance seen in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients should inform in the development of pan-Coronavirus vaccines 1. In the present study, using several immuno-informatics and sequence alignment approaches, we identified several human B-cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are highly conserved in: (i) greater than 81,000 SARS-CoV-2 human strains identified to date in 190 countries on six continents; (ii) six circulating CoVs that caused previous human outbreaks of the ""Common Cold""; (iii) five SL-CoVs isolated from bats; (iv) five SL-CoV isolated from pangolins; (v) three SL-CoVs isolated from Civet Cats; and (vi) four MERS strains isolated from camels. Furthermore, we identified cross-reactive asymptomatic epitopes that: (i) recalled B cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from both asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2; and (ii) induced strong B cell and T cell responses in ""humanized"" Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR/HLA-A*02:01 double transgenic mice.

Potent drugs for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are not yet available. To identify host factors that support coronavirus infection, we performed genome-wide functional genetic screens with SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold virus HCoV-229E in non-transgenic human cells. These screens identified PI3K type 3 as a potential drug target against multiple coronaviruses. We discovered that the lysosomal protein TMEM106B is an important host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we show that TMEM106B is required for replication in multiple human cell lines derived from liver and lung and is expressed in relevant cell types in the human airways.

313,No evidence that plasmablasts transdifferentiate into developing neutrophils in severe COVID-19 disease,"A recent study by Wilk et al. of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in seven patients hospitalized with COVID-19 described a population of ""developing neutrophils"" that were ""phenotypically related by dimensionality reduction"" to plasmablasts, and that these two cell populations represent a ""linear continuum of cellular phenotype""1. The authors suggest that, in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe COVID-19, a ""differentiation bridge from plasmablasts to developing neutrophils"" connected these distantly related cell types. This conclusion is controversial as it appears to violate several basic principles in cell biology relating to cell lineage identity and fidelity. Correctly classifying cells and their developmental history is an important issue in cell biology and we suggest that this conclusion is not supported by the data as we show here that: (1) regressing out covariates such as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can lead to overfitting; and (2) that UMAP embeddings may reflect the expression of similar genes but not necessarily direct cell lineage relationships.",Jose Alquicira-Hernandez; Joseph Powell; Tri Giang Phan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202945,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.312538,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,False
314,Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing Trees (UShER) Empowers Real-Time Phylogenetics for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads through human populations, the unprecedented accumulation of viral genome sequences is ushering a new era of ""genomic contact tracing"" - that is, using viral genome sequences to trace local transmission dynamics. However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large - and will undoubtedly grow many fold - placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient, tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization by orders of magnitude, making it possible to complete the placements under real-time constraints. Our method also provides the key ingredient for maintaining a fully-updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data. The methods described here will empower research and genomic contact tracing for laboratories worldwide.

315,A Tethered Ligand Assay to Probe the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 Interaction under Constant Force,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating global impact and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to human host cells through interaction of its receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. RBD binding to ACE2 is a critical first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral attachment occurs in dynamic environments where forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play central roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using specific molecular handles, we tether the fusion proteins between a functionalized flow cell surface and magnetic beads in magnetic tweezers. We observe repeated interactions of RBD and ACE2 under constant loads and can fully quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the binding interaction. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, a larger free energy of binding, and a lower off-rate than that of SARS-CoV-1, the causative agents of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. In the absence of force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD rapidly (within [&le;]1 ms) engages the ACE2 receptor if held in close proximity and remains bound to ACE2 for 400-800 s, much longer than what has been reported for other viruses engaging their cellular receptors.

316,Discovery and Development of Human SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies using an Unbiased Phage Display Library Approach,"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies represent an important component of the ongoing search for effective treatment of and protection against COVID-19. We report here on the use of a naive phage display antibody library to identify a panel of fully human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Following functional profiling in vitro against an early pandemic isolate as well as a recently emerged isolate bearing the D614G Spike mutation, the clinical candidate antibody, STI-1499, and the affinity-engineered variant, STI-2020, were evaluated for in vivo efficacy in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID-19. Both antibodies demonstrated potent protection against the pathogenic effects of the disease and a dose-dependent reduction of virus load in the lungs, reaching undetectable levels following a single dose of 500 micrograms of STI-2020. These data support continued development of these antibodies as therapeutics against COVID-19 and future use of this approach to address novel emerging pandemic disease threats.",Xia Cao; Junki Maruyama; Heyue Zhou; Lisa Kerwin; Rachel Sattler; John T Manning; Sachi Johnson; Susan Richards; Yan Li; Weiqun Shen; Benjamin Blair; Na Du; Kyndal Morais; Kate Lawrence; Lucy Lu; Chin-I Pai; Donghui Li; Mark Brunswick; Yanliang Zhang; Henry Ji; Slobodan Paessler; Robert D Allen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202556,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.316174,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,False
317,"Host transcriptomic profiling of COVID-19 patients with mild, moderate, and severe clinical outcomes","Characterizing key molecular and cellular pathways involved in COVID-19 is essential for disease prognosis and management. We perform shotgun transcriptome sequencing of human RNA obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and identify a molecular signature associated with disease severity. Specifically, we identify globally dysregulated immune related pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, JAK-STAT, and TGF-{beta} signaling pathways in all, though to a higher extent in patients with severe symptoms. The excessive release of cytokines and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL22, CXCL9 and CXCL12 and certain interferons and interleukins related genes like IFIH1, IFI44, IFIT1 and IL10 were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical presentation compared to mild and moderate presentations. Moreover, early induction of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway might be the primary cause of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe disease. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small set of regulatory genes that might act as strong predictors of patient outcome. Our data suggest that rapid transcriptome analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs can be a powerful approach to quantify host molecular response and may provide valuable insights into COVID-19 pathophysiology.",Mohammed Uddin; Tom Loney; Norbert Nowotny; Hanan Alsuwaidi; Rupa Varghese; Zulfa Deesi; Abdulmajeed Alkhajeh; Hamda Khansaheb; Alawi Alsheikh-Ali,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202556,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316604,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,False
318,Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography utilizing nanobody technology for expression screening of membrane proteins,"Membrane proteins play numerous physiological roles and are thus of tremendous interest in pharmacology. Nevertheless, stable and homogeneous sample preparation is one of the bottlenecks in biophysical and pharmacological studies of membrane proteins because membrane proteins are typically unstable and poorly expressed. To overcome such obstacles, GFP fusion-based Fluorescence-detection Size-Exclusion Chromatography (FSEC) has been widely employed for membrane protein expression screening for over a decade. However, fused GFP itself may occasionally affect the expression and/or stability of the targeted membrane protein, leading to both false-positive and false-negative results in expression screening. Furthermore, GFP fusion technology is not well suited for some membrane proteins depending on their membrane topology. Here, we developed an FSEC assay utilizing nanobody (Nb) technology, named FSEC-Nb, in which targeted membrane proteins are fused to a small peptide tag and recombinantly expressed. The whole-cell extracts are solubilized, mixed with anti-peptide Nb fused to GFP and applied to a size-exclusion chromatography column attached to a fluorescence detector for FSEC analysis. FSEC-Nb enables one to evaluate the expression, monodispersity and thermostability of membrane proteins without the need of purification by utilizing the benefits of the GFP fusion-based FSEC method, but does not require direct GFP fusion to targeted proteins. We applied FSEC-Nb to screen zinc-activated ion channel (ZAC) family proteins in the Cys-loop superfamily and membrane proteins from SARS-CoV-2 as examples of the practical application of FSEC-Nb. We successfully identified a ZAC ortholog with high monodispersity but moderate expression levels that could not be identified with the previously developed GFP fusion-free FSEC method. Consistent with the results of FSEC-Nb screening, the purified ZAC ortholog showed monodispersed particles by both negative staining EM and cryo-EM. Furthermore, we identified two membrane proteins from SARS-CoV-2 with high monodispersity and expression level by FSEC-Nb, which may facilitate structural and functional studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results show FSEC-Nb as a powerful tool for membrane protein expression screening that can provide further opportunity to prepare well-behaved membrane proteins for structural and functional studies.",Fei Jin; Yao Wang; Mengqi Wang; Minxuan Sun; Motoyuki Hattori,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202168,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316307,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,False
319,Exploring dynamics and network analysis of spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2,"The ongoing pandemic caused by coronavirus SARS-COV-2 continues to rage with devastating consequences on human health and global economy. The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein. Overall, the results of this study provide detailed understanding of the spike glycan shield, which may be utilized for therapeutic efforts against this crisis.",Mahdi Ghorbani; Bernie R Brooks; Jeffery B.

320,Hydroxychloroquine increased psychiatric-like behaviors and disrupted the expression of related genes in the mouse brain,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which has been proposed as a therapeutic or prophylactic drug for SARS-COV-2, has been administered to thousands of individuals with varying efficacy; however, our understanding of its adverse effects is insufficient. It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days and enhanced depressive behavior at 24 h. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Most of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential. According to our data, we recommend that HCQ be carefully used as a prophylactic drug in people who are susceptible to mental disorders.",Hang Xu; Xiangyang Zhang; Weiwen Wang; Jiesi Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202457,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.316158,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,False
321,Impact of COVID-19 on Hospital Admission of Acute Stroke patients in Bangladesh,"BackgroundWith the proposed pathophysiologic mechanism of neurologic injury by SARS COV-2 the frequency of stroke and henceforth the related hospital admissions were expected to rise. In this paper we investigate this presumption by comparing the frequency of admissions of stroke cases in Bangladesh before and during the pandemic.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of stroke admissions in a 100-bed stroke unit at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS&H) which is considerably a large stroke unit. We considered all the admitted cases from the 1st January to the 30th June, 2020. We used Poisson regressions to determine whether statistically significant changes in admission counts can be found before and after 25 March since when there is a surge in COVID-19 infections.

ResultsA total of 1394 stroke patients got admitted during the study period. Half of the patients were older than 60 years, whereas only 2.6% were 30 years old or younger with a male-female ratio of 1.06:1. From January to March, 2020 the mean rate of admission was 302.3 cases per month which dropped to 162.3 cases per month from April to June with an overall reduction of 46.3% in acute stroke admission per month. In those two periods, reductions in average admission per month for ischemic stroke (IST), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and venous stroke (VS) were 45.5%, 37.2%, 71.4% and 39.0%, respectively. Based on weekly data, results of Poisson regressions confirm that the average number of admissions per week dropped significantly during the last three months of the sample period. Further, in the first three months, a total of 22 cases of hyperacute stroke management were done whereas in the last three months there was an 86.4% reduction in the number of hyperacute stroke patients getting reperfusion treatment. Only 38 patients (2.7%) were later found to be RT- PCR for SARS Cov-2 positive based on nasal swab testing.

ConclusionOur study revealed more than fifty percent reduction in acute stroke admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is still elusive whether the reduction is related to the fear of getting infected by COVID-19 from hospitalization or the overall restriction on public movement and stay-home measures.",A T M Hasibul Hasan; Subir  Chandra Das; Muhammad  Sougatul Islam; Mohaimen Mansur; Md Shajedur  Rahman Shawon; Rashedul Hassan; Mohammad Shah  Jahirul Hoque Chowdhury; Md Badrul  Alam Mondal; Quazi  Deen Mohammad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202457,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316448,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,False
322,"Influence of COVID-19 confinement measures on appendectomies in Germany - administrative claims data analysis of 9,797 patients","Purpose: COVID 19 pandemic had multiple influences on the social, industrial and medical situation in all affected countries. Measures of obligatory medical confinement were suspensions of scheduled non-emergent surgical procedures and outpatients clinics as well as overall access restrictions to hospitals and medical practices. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if the obligatory confinement (lockdown) had an effect on the number of appendectomies (during and after the period of lockdown). Methods: This retrospective study was based on anonymized nationwide administrative claims data of the German Local General Sickness Fund (AOK). Patients admitted for disease of the appendix (ICD-10: K35-K38) or abdominal and pelvic pain (ICD-10: R10) who undergone an appendectomy (OPS: 5-470) were included. The study period included six weeks of German lockdown (16.03.-26.04.2020) as well as six weeks before (03.02.-15.03.2020) and after (27.04.-07.06.2020). These periods were compared to the respective in 2019. Results: Overall number of appendectomies was significantly reduced during the lockdown time in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease affects only appendectomies due to acute simple and non-acute appendicitis. Numbers for appendectomies in acute complex appendicitis remained unchanged. Female patients and in the age group 1-18 years showed the strongest decrease in number of cases. Conclusion: The lockdown in Germany resulted in a decreased number of appendectomies. This affected mainly appendectomies in simple acute and non-acute appendicitis, but not complicated acute appendicitis. The study gives no evidence, that the confinement measures resulted in a deterioration of medical care for appendicitis.",Matthias Maneck; Christian Guenster; Hans-Joachim Meyer; Claus-Dieter Heidecke; Udo Rolle,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.316018,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20198986,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True

We analysed data from 3 hospitals to understand which children were not being brought during the COVID-19 lockdown. In our population there is no evidence of a disproportionate impact on children belonging to vulnerable sociodemographic groups and no obvious change in illness acuity among those children still attending. However we noted a marked reduction in infectious disease presentations which might reflect one positive impact of enhanced social distancing on child health.

324,The Use of Psychoactive Substances in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Brazil,"Background: The protocols for mitigating the transmission of Covid-19 seem to be a trigger for the use of psychoactive substances, as an individual's adaptive response to support this new way of being in the world. Objective: To investigate the use of psychoactive substances in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. Method: A cross-sectional and prospective observational study, undertaken in a virtual environment. An online survey was developed and employed through Google Forms to collect data. The survey was made available to participants on social networks, Facebook@, Whatsapp@, and Instagram@, linked to the research group, during the period 06/15/2020 to 07/15/2020. 1,145 individuals participated in the research. Results: The average age of the participants was 37 years old. They were mostly female, white, Brazilians, with a higher education level, with occupations in the health field, and had religion. They either maintained their family income or suffered a small income decrease. Moreover, they informed that they were caring for social isolation. The most used substances before and after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic were alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, although the use of these substances decreased (P<0.001). Approximately 32% of the participants started using psychoactive substances in this period. Among them, most individuals started by their own initiative. Conclusions: For a better understanding of the pattern use of psychoactive substances during the Covid-19 pandemic and the adverse effects on human behavior and mental disorders, careful longitudinal studies must be developed, due to the great interest in the knowledge of adaptive responses when people's lives are at risk.",Cesar Augusto Trinta Weber; Ingridi Teixeira Monteiro; Julia Medeiros Gehrke; Wagner Silva de Souza,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316281,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20194431,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
325,COVID-19 in Youth Soccer,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the case and incidence rates of COVID-19 among youth soccer players and evaluate the relationship with background COVID-19 risk and phase of return to play. Methods: Surveys were distributed to soccer clubs throughout the country regarding their phase of return to soccer (individual only, group non-contact, group contact) and date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk reduction procedures that were being implemented. Overall case and incidence rates were compared to national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks where available. Finally, a negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases with local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. Results: 129 clubs responded, of whom 124 had reinitiated soccer, representing 91,007 players with a median duration of 73 days (IQR: 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85,861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than the national rate for children in the US (254 v. 477 cases per 100,000; IRR = 0.511, 95% CI = [0.40-0.57], p<0.001) and the general population from the counties in which soccer clubs were based where data was available (268 v. 864 cases per 100,000; IRR = 0.202 [0.19-0.21], p<0.001). After adjusting for local COVID-19 incidence, there was no relationship between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return (non-contact: {beta}=0.35{+/-}0.67, p=0.61; contact: {beta}=0.18{+/-}0.67, p=0.79). No cases were reported to have resulted in hospitalization or death. 100% of clubs reported having a plan in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and utilizing multiple different risk reduction procedures (median 8, IQR 6-10). Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes is relatively low when compared to the background incidence among children in the United States and the local general population. No relationship was identified between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return to soccer.

326,Cost-effectiveness of remdesivir and dexamethasone for COVID-19 treatment in South Africa,"Background South Africa recently experienced a first peak in COVID-19 cases and mortality. Dexamethasone and remdesivir both have the potential to reduce COVID-related mortality, but their cost-effectiveness in a resource-limited setting with scant intensive care resources is unknown. Methods We projected intensive care unit (ICU) needs and capacity from August 2020 to January 2021 using the South African National COVID-19 Epi Model. We assessed cost-effectiveness of 1) administration of dexamethasone to ventilated patients and remdesivir to non-ventilated patients, 2) dexamethasone alone to both non-ventilated and ventilated patients, 3) remdesivir to non-ventilated patients only, and 4) dexamethasone to ventilated patients only; all relative to a scenario of standard care. We estimated costs from the healthcare system perspective in 2020 USD, deaths averted, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of each scenario. Results Remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated patients was estimated to result in 1,111 deaths averted (assuming a 0-30% efficacy of remdesivir) compared to standard care, and save $11.5 million. The result was driven by the efficacy of the drugs, and the reduction of ICU-time required for patients treated with remdesivir. The scenario of dexamethasone alone to ventilated and non-ventilated patients requires additional $159,000 and averts 1,146 deaths, resulting in $139 per death averted, relative to standard care. Conclusions The use of dexamethasone for ventilated and remdesivir for non-ventilated patients is likely to be cost-saving compared to standard care.

327,Dynamic Modeling of Reported Covid-19 Cases and Deaths with Continuously Varying Case Fatality and Transmission Rate Functions,"In this paper, we propose an enhanced SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Death) model with time varying case fatality and transmission rates for confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. We show that when case fatalities and transmission rates are represented by simple Sigmoid functions, historical cases and fatalities can be fit with a relative-root-mean-squared-error accuracy on the order of 2% for most American states over the period from initial cases to July 20 (2020). We find that the model is most accurate for states that so far had not shown signs of multiple waves of the disease (such as New York), and least accurate for states where transmission rates increased after initially declining (such as Hawaii). For such states, we propose an alternate multi-phase model. Both the base model and multi-phase model provide a way to explain historical reported cases and deaths with a small set of parameters, which in the future can enable analyses of uncertainty and variations in disease progression across regions.",Mingdong Lyu; Randolph Hall,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.312538,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201905,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
328,Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human upper and lower respiratory tracts and their relationship with infectiousness,"SARS-CoV-2 is a human pathogen that causes infection in both the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to infectiousness and disease progression are not well understood. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the URT and LRT. We fit the models to viral load data from patients with likely infection dates known, we estimated that infected individuals with a longer incubation period had lower rates of viral growth, took longer to reach peak viremia in the URT, and had higher chances of presymptomatic transmission. We then developed a model linking viral load to infectiousness. We found that to explain the substantial fraction of transmissions occurring presymptomatically, the infectiousness of a person should depend on a saturating function of the viral load, making the logarithm of the URT viral load a better surrogate of infectiousness than the viral load itself. Comparing the roles of target-cell limitation, the innate immune response, proliferation of target cells and spatial infection in the LRT, we found that spatial dissemination in the lungs is likely to be an important process in sustaining the prolonged high viral loads. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for predicting how SARS-CoV-2 within-host dynamics determine infectiousness and represent a step towards quantifying how viral load dynamics and the immune responses determine disease severity.",Ruian Ke; Carolin Zitzmann; Ruy M.

329,Deep Immune Profiling of MIS-C demonstrates marked but transient immune activation compared to adult and pediatric COVID-19,"Pediatric COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with fewer hospitalizations and often milder disease than in adults. A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.",Laura Vella; Josephine R.

330,Prioritising COVID-19 vaccination in changing social and epidemiological landscapes,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities must decide which groups to prioritise for vaccination. These decision will occur in a constantly shifting social-epidemiological landscape where the success of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like physical distancing requires broad population acceptance. We developed a coupled social-epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Schools and workplaces are closed and re-opened based on reported cases. We used evolutionary game theory and mobility data to model individual adherence to NPIs. We explored the impact of vaccinating 60+ year-olds first; <20 year-olds first; uniformly by age; and a novel contact-based strategy. The last three strategies interrupt transmission while the first targets a vulnerable group. Vaccination rates ranged from 0.5% to 4.5% of the population per week, beginning in January or July 2021. Case notifications, NPI adherence, and lockdown periods undergo successive waves during the simulated pandemic. Vaccination reduces median deaths by 32%-77% (22%-63%) for January (July) availability, depending on the scenario. Vaccinating 60+ year-olds first prevents more deaths (up to 8% more) than transmission-interrupting strategies for January vaccine availability across most parameter regimes. In contrast, transmission-interrupting strategies prevent up to 33% more deaths than vaccinating 60+ year-olds first for July availability, due to higher levels of natural immunity by that time. Sensitivity analysis supports the findings. Further research is urgently needed to determine which populations can benefit from using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission.",Peter Jentsch; Madhur Anand; Chris T Bauch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201889,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201889,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
331,"Quantitative, Epitope-specific, Serological Screening of COVID-19 Patients Using a Novel Multiplexed Array-based Immunoassay Platform","Following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in late 2019, a large number of antibody tests were developed for use in seroprevalence studies aimed at determining the extent of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 virus infections in a given population. The vast majority of these tests are qualitative and use a single target for antibody detection, incorporating either full-length or truncated versions of the nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins from SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, mono-epitope tests - whether qualitative or quantitative - are unable to localise antibody binding or characterise the distribution and titres of epitope recognition by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within an individual or across a population. However, it seems plausible that if such information were available, it may correlate with the presence of potent, high-titre, neutralising antibodies that afford protection again imminent re-infection, as well as with the likelihood of developing a memory B-cell response that would provide more durable protection. We have developed a novel, quantitative, multi-antigen, multiplexed, array-based immunoassay platform, ImmuSAFE COVID+ (ImmuSAFE) comprising 6 functionally validated domains or regions of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed using Sengenics KREX technology. This array platform enables determination of both the position and breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses following natural infection or vaccination. To validate our platform, 100 serum samples (confirmed sero-positive COVID-19 cases, n=50; pre-pandemic HIV positive controls, n=50) were tested for IgG seropositivity to the N antigen, yielding 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. All 50 cases showed positive antibody reactivity towards at least one N protein epitope, whilst all 50 controls showed antibody reactivity below threshold values. Broad variation was also observed in the magnitude and breadth of antibodies present, represented as an Epitope Coverage score (EPC). A positive correlation was observed between increasing age and EPC values, with individuals under 40 years old having a mean EPC score of 3.1, whilst individuals above the age of 60 had a mean EPC of 5.1. This finding may have broad implications for the natural history of COVID-19 disease in different individuals.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan; Nur Izwani Shaiful Bahrin; Nurul Shielawati Mohamed Rosli; Noorul Hidayah Badri; Teh Norleila Abdul Rahman; Arif Anwar; Rozainanee Mohd Zain,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201889,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201269,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
332,A combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab is more sensitive than mouthwash in detecting SARS-CoV-2 by a high-throughput PCR assay,"Objectives: The optimal diagnostic specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in the upper respiratory tract is unclear. Mouthwash fluid has been reported as an alternative to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. We compared mouthwash fluid with a combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab regarding test performance. Methods: We tested asymptomatic persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and their household contacts. First, a mouthwash (gargling for at least 5 sec) with sterile water was performed. Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800 system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. Results: Of 76 persons, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 (17%) of these infections but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs.

334,High admission blood glucose is an independent risk factor of poor prognosis in COVID-19: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis,"Aims To investigate the prognostic value of admission blood glucose (BG) in predicting COVID-19 outcomes, including poor composite outcomes (mortality/severity), mortality, and severity. Materials and methods Eligible studies evaluating the prognostic value of fasting BG (FBG) and random BG (RBG) levels in predicting COVID-19 outcomes were included and assessed for risk of bias with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Random-effects high-vs-low meta-analysis followed by dose-response analysis using generalized least squares model in a two-stage random-effects meta-analysis were conducted. Potential non-linear association was explored using restricted cubic splines and pooled using restricted maximum likelihood model in a multivariate meta-analysis. Results The search yielded 35 studies involving a total of 14,502 patients. We discovered independent association between admission FBG and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated non-linear relationship between admission FBG and severity (Pnon-linearity<0.001), where each 1 mmol/L increase augmented the risk of COVID-19 severity by 33% (risk ratio 1.33 [95% CI: 1.26-1.40]). Albeit exhibiting similar trends, study scarcity limited the strength of evidence on the independent prognostic value of admission RBG. GRADE assessment yielded high-quality evidence for the association between admission FBG and COVID-19 severity, and moderate-quality evidence for its association with mortality and poor outcomes, while the other assessments yielded very low-to-low quality. Conclusion High level of FBG at admission was independently associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Further researches to confirm the observed prognostic value of admission RBG and to ascertain the estimated dose-response risk between admission FBG and on COVID-19 severity are required.",Gilbert Lazarus; Jessica Audrey; Vincent Kharisma Wangsaputra; Alice Tamara; Dicky L.

335,"INFERRED RESOLUTION THROUGH HERD IMMMUNITY OF FIRST COVID-19 WAVE IN MANAUS, BRAZILIAN AMAZON","As in many other settings, peak excess mortality preceded the officially reported `first wave' peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus, Brazil, reflecting delayed case recognition and limited initial access to diagnostic testing. To avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemic's trajectory and infer the cause of its decline using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing over time due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a small, self-isolated population fraction raised the estimated herd-immunity threshold from 28% to 30% and reduced the final attack rate from 86% to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained susceptible to infection. Given uncertainties regarding the distancing behaviours of population subgroups with different social and economic characteristics, and the duration of sterilising or transmission-modifying immunity in exposed individuals, we conclude that the potential for epidemic outbreaks remains, but that future waves of infection are likely to be much less pronounced than that already experienced.",Thomas Prowse; Tara Purcell; Djane Clarys Baia-da-Silva; Vanderson Sampaio; Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro; James Wood; Ivo Mueller; Jodie McVernon; Marcus Lacerda; Joshua Ross,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201541,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201939,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
336,Airway emergency management in a pediatric hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective Children's hospitals frequently care for infants with various life-threatening airway anomalies. Management of these infants can be challenging given unique airway anatomy and potential malformations. Airway emergency management must be immediate and precise, often demanding specialized equipment and/or expertise. We developed a Neonatal-Infant Airway Safety Program to improve medical responses, communication, equipment usage and outcomes for infants requiring emergent airway interventions. Patients and Methods All patients admitted to our quaternary neonatal and infant intensive care unit (NICU) from 2008-2019 were included in this study. Our program consisted of a multidisciplinary airway response team, pager system, and emergency equipment cart. Respiratory therapists present at each emergency event recorded specialist response times, equipment utilization, and outcomes. A multidisciplinary oversite committee reviewed each incident. Results Since 2008, there were 159 airway emergency events in our NICU (~12 per year). Mean specialist response times decreased from 5.9{+/-}4.9 min (2008-2012, mean{+/-}SD) to 4.3{+/-}2.2 min (2016-2019, p=0.12), and the number of incidents with response times >5 min decreased from 28.8{+/-}17.8% (2008-2012) to 9.3{+/-}11.4% (2016-2019, p=0.04 by linear regression). As our program became more standardized, we noted better equipment availability and subspecialist communication. Few emergency situations (n=9, 6%) required operating room management. There were 3 patient deaths (2%). Conclusions Our airway safety program, including readily available specialists and equipment, facilitated effective resolution of airway emergencies in our NICU and multidisciplinary involvement enabled rapid and effective changes in response to COVID-19 regulations.

337,Antihypertensive Medications and COVID-19 Diagnosis and Mortality: Population-based Case-Control Analysis in the United Kingdom,"Objectives: To evaluate antihypertensive medications and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality, accounting for healthcare seeking behaviour. Design: A population-based case control study with additional cohort analysis. Setting: Primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants: 16 866 patients with COVID-19 events in the CPRD from 29th January to June 25th 2020 and 70 137 matched controls. Main outcome measures: We explored associations between COVID-19 diagnosis and prescriptions for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (B), calcium-channel blockers (C), thiazide diuretics (D) and other antihypertensive drugs (O). We evaluated all-cause mortality among COVID-19 cases. Analyses were adjusted for covariates and consultation frequency. Results: In covariate adjusted analyses, ACEIs were associated with lower odds of COVID-19 diagnosis (0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.88) as were ARBs, 0.87 (0.80 to 0.95) with little attenuation from adjustment for consultation frequency. In fully adjusted analyses, C and D were also associated with lower odds of COVID-19. Increased odds of COVID-19 for B (1.19, 1.12 to 1.26), were attenuated after adjustment for consultation frequency (1.01, 0.95 to 1.08). In adjusted analyses, patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs had similar mortality to patients treated with classes B, C, D or O (1.00, 0.83 to 1.20) or patients receiving no antihypertensive therapy (0.99, 0.83 to 1.18). Conclusions: Associations were sensitive to adjustment for confounding and healthcare seeking, but there was no evidence that antihypertensive therapy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality; most classes of antihypertensive therapy showed negative associations with COVID-19 diagnosis.",Emma Rezel-Potts; Abdel Douiri; Phil J Chowienczyk; Martin C Gulliford,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201350,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201731,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
338,Hearing the voices of Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The statistics of healthcare worker (HCW) COVID-19 infections do not convey the lived experience of HCWs during the pandemic. This study explores the working conditions and issues faced by Australian HCWs. Methods: Qualitative analysis of free-text responses from Australian HCWs from 3 August to 5 August 2020 from an open letter calling for better respiratory protection for HCWs, transparent reporting of HCW COVID-19 infections and diversity in national infection control policy development. The open letter was sent to an email list of 23,000 HCWs from a previous campaign and promoted on social media. Results: Among 2,733 HCWs who signed the open letter during the study period, 407 free-text responses were analysed. Doctors and nurses accounted for 58% and 35% of respondents, respectively. Most respondents came from Victoria (48%); New South Wales (18%); Queensland (12%) or Western Australia (12%). Dominant themes included concerns about: work health and safety standards; guidelines on respiratory protection including the omission of fit-testing of P2/N95 respirators; deficiencies in the availability, quality, appropriateness and training of personal protective equipment; a top-down workplace culture that enabled bullying in response to concerns about safety that culminated a loss of trust in leadership, self-reported COVID-19 infections in some respondents and moral injury. Conclusion: Occupational moral injury in HCWs is the consequence of lapses in leadership at policy-making and organisational levels that have violated the normative expectations of HCWs. The challenge for healthcare leaders is to address workplace culture, consultation and engagement with HCWs in order to prevent this hidden pandemic from spreading throughout the health system.",Michelle Ananda-Rajah; Benjamin Veness; Danielle Berkovic; Catriona Parker; Greg Kelly; Darshini Ayton,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20200774,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20197061,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
339,"Onset, duration, and persistence of taste and smell changes and other COVID-19 symptoms: longitudinal study in Israeli patients","Objectives: The multifaceted disease manifestation of COVID-19 requires longitudinal characterization of symptoms, to aid with screening and disease management. Methods: Phone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a 6 week period. Results: More than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by ~70 of the patients. Over one third of patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. If fatigue was reported, it was usually the first symptom to appear. Smell and taste changes had occurred 3.9 {+/-} 5.4 and 4.6 {+/-} 5.7 days (mean {+/-} SD) since disease onset and emerged as first symptoms in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever was the shortest lasting symptom (5.8 {+/-} 8.6 days (mean {+/-} SD), and smell and taste changes were the most long-lasting symptoms (24.3 {+/-} 22.9 days and 19.4 {+/-} 19.1 (mean {+/-} SD), respectively), with longer smell recovery correlated with smell change severity. In one third of patients who reported cough, smell and taste changes, these symptoms persisted after negative RT-PCR tests. Conclusions: Each symptom can occur as first or later, though some are more likely to appear as firsts, and typically more than one symptom occurs at disease onset. The severity of olfactory change is associated with its recovery time. Lack of chemosensory recuperation in recovered patients is common.

Large-scale testing is limited by the need for in-person blood collection by staff trained in venepuncture. Capillary blood self-sampling and postage to laboratories for analysis could provide a reliable alternative. Two-hundred and nine matched venous and capillary blood samples were obtained from thirty nine participants and analysed using a COVID-19 IgG ELISA to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thirty seven out of thirty eight participants were able to self-collect an adequate sample of capillary blood ([&ge;]50 l). Using plasma from venous blood collected in lithium heparin as the reference standard, matched capillary blood samples, collected in lithium heparin-treated tubes and on filter paper as dried blood spots, achieved a Cohen's kappa coefficient of >0.88 (near-perfect agreement).

341,Modeling COVID-19 as a National Dynamics with a SARS-CoV-2 Prevalent Variant: Brazil - A Study Case,"COVID-19 global dynamics is modeled by an adaptation of the deterministic SEIR Model, which takes into account two dominant lineages of the SARS-CoV-2, and a time-varying reproduction number to estimate the disease transmission behavior. Such a methodology can be applied worldwide to predict forecasts of the outbreak in any infected country. The pandemic in Brazil was selected as a first study case. Brazilian official published data from February 25th to August 30th, 2020 was used to adjust a few epidemiologic parameters. The estimated time-dependence mean value to the infected individuals (confirmed cases) presents - in logarithmic scale - standard deviation SD = 0.08 for over six orders of magnitude. Data points for additional three weeks were added after the model was complete, granting confidence on the outcomes. By the end of 2020, the predicted numbers of confirmed cases in Brazil, within 95% credible intervals, may reach 6 Million (5 to 7), and fatalities would accounts for 180 (130 to 220) thousands. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to reach (13 +/- 1) Million, 6.2% of the Brazilian population.

342,Defining the Syrian hamster as a highly susceptible preclinical model for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Following emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly became pandemic and is presently responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. There is currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control. In conclusion, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it a very suitable infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.

Electrostatic filters may reduce cross-infection. This study aims to determine if including a filter in the bubble CPAP circuit impacts stability of pressure delivery. Methods: A new electrostatic filter was placed before (pre) or after (post) the bubble CPAP generator, or with no filter (control) in an in vitro study. Pressure was recorded at the nasal interface for 18 h (6 L/min; 7 cmH2O) on three occasions for each configuration. Filter failure was defined as pressure >9 cmH20 for 60 continuous minutes. The filter was weighed before and after each experiment. Results: Mean (SD) time to reach the fail-point was 257 (116) min and 525 (566) min for filter placement pre- and post-CPAP generator, respectively. Mean pressure was higher throughout in the pre-generator position compared to control. The filter weight was heavier at study end in the pre- compared to the post-generator position. Conclusions: Placement of the filter at the pre-generator position in a bubble CPAP circuit should be avoided due to unstable mean pressure.

346,Public health information on COVID-19 for international travellers: Lessons learned from a rapid mixed-method evaluation in the UK containment phase,"Introduction In the containment phase of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Public Health England (PHE) delivered advice to travellers arriving at major UK ports. We aimed to rapidly evaluate the impact and effectiveness of these communication materials for passengers in the early stages of the pandemic. Methods In stage I (Patient and Public Involvement, PPI) we interviewed seven travellers who had returned from China in January and February 2020. We used these results to develop a questionnaire and topic guides for stage II, a cross-sectional survey and follow-up interviews with passengers arriving at London Heathrow Airport on scheduled flights from China and Singapore. The survey assessed passengers' knowledge of symptoms, actions to take and attitudes towards PHE COVID-19 public health information; interviews explored their views of official public health information and self-isolation. Results In stage II, 121 passengers participated in the survey and 15 in follow-up interviews. 83% of surveyed passengers correctly identified all three COVID-19 associated symptoms listed in PHE information at that time. Most could identify the recommended actions and found the advice understandable and trustworthy. Interviews revealed that passengers shared concerns about the lack of wider official action, and that passengers' knowledge had been acquired elsewhere as much from PHE. Respondents also noted their own agency in choosing to self-isolate, partially as a self-protective measure. Conclusion PHE COVID-19 public health information was perceived as clear and acceptable, but we found that passengers acquired knowledge from various sources and they saw the provision of information alone on arrival as an insufficient official response. Our study provides fresh insights into the importance of taking greater account of diverse information sources and of the need for public assurance in creating public health information materials to address global health threats.

347,Impact of Personal Care Habits on Post-Lockdown COVID-19 Contagion: Insights from Agent-based Simulations,"After the first wave of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world are struggling to recover their economies by slowly lifting the mobility restrictions and social distance measures enforced during the crisis. Therefore, the post-lockdown containment of the disease will depend strongly not any more on government-imposed interventions but on personal care measures, taken voluntarily by their citizens. In this respect, recent studies have shed some light regarding the effectiveness individual protection habits may have in preventing SARS-Cov-2 transmission, particularly physical contact distancing, facial mask wearing and hand-washing habits. In this paper we describe experiments performed on a simulated COVID-19 epidemic in an artificial population using an agent based model, so as to illustrate to what extent the interplay between such personal care habits contributes to mitigate the spread of the disease, assuming the lack of other population-wide non-pharmaceutical interventions or vaccines. We discuss scenarios where wide adherence to these voluntary care habits alone, can be enough to contain the unfold of the contagion. Our model purpose is illustrative and contributes to ratify the importance of disseminating the message regarding the collective benefits of mass adoption of personal protection and hygiene habits, as an exit strategy for COVID-19 in the new normal state.",Lindsay Alvarez-Pomar; Sergio Rojas-Galeano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20197061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200212,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
348,SCOAT-Net: A Novel Network for Segmenting COVID-19 Lung Opacification from CT Images,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide at a rapid rate. There is no clinically automated tool to quantify the infection of COVID-19 patients. Automatic segmentation of lung opacification from computed tomography (CT) images provides excellent potential, which is of great significance for judging the disease development and treatment response of the patients. However, the segmentation of lung opacification from CT slices still faces some challenges, including the complexity and variability features of the opacity regions, the small difference between the infected and healthy tissues, and the noise of CT images. Besides, due to the limited medical resources, it is impractical to obtain a large amount of data in a short time, which further hinders the training of deep learning models. To answer these challenges, we proposed a novel spatial and channel-wise coarse-to-fine attention network (CAT-Net) inspired by the biological vision mechanism, which is for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung opacification from CT Images. CAT-Net has the spatial-wise attention module and the channel-wise attention module to attract the self-attention learning of the network, which serves to extract the practical features at the pixel and channel level successfully. Experiments show that our proposed CAT-Net achieves better results compared to state-of-the-art image segmentation networks.",Shixuan Zhao; Yongjie Li; Zhidan Li; Yang Chen; Wei Zhao; Xie Xingzhi; Jun Liu; Di Zhao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201343,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20191726,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
349,The potential health and economic value of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alongside physical distancing in the UK: transmission model-based future scenario analysis and economic evaluation,"Background In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the UK adopted mandatory physical distancing measures in March 2020. Vaccines against the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may become available as early as late 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing scenarios in the UK. Methods We used an age-structured dynamic-transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of immunisation programmes over ten years. Assuming vaccines are effective in 5-64 year olds, we compared vaccinating 90% of individuals in this age group to no vaccination. We assumed either vaccine effectiveness of 25% and 1-year protection and 90% re-vaccinated annually, or 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection and 10% re-vaccinated annually. Natural immunity was assumed to last 45 weeks in the base case. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing. We considered benefits from disease prevented in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs to the healthcare payer versus the national economy. We discounted at 3.5% annually and monetised health impact at 20,000 per QALY to obtain the net monetary value, which we explored in sensitivity analyses. Findings Without vaccination and physical distancing, we estimated 147.9 million COVID-19 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 48.5 million, 198.7 million) and 2.8 million (770,000, 4.2 million) deaths in the UK over ten years. Vaccination with 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection may stop community transmission entirely for several years, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic without highly effective vaccines. Introducing vaccination compared to no vaccination leads to economic gains (positive net monetary value) of 0.37 billion to +1.33 billion across all physical distancing and vaccine effectiveness scenarios from the healthcare perspective, but net monetary values of physical distancing scenarios may be negative from societal perspective if the daily national economy losses are persistent and large. Interpretation Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Given uncertainty around both characteristics of the eventually licensed vaccines and long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, our study provides early insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era from an economic and epidemiological perspective.",Frank Sandmann; Nicholas Davies; - Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 working group; Anna Vassall; W John Edmunds; Mark Jit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201343,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200857,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
350,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare environment: a multicentre study conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England,"Understanding how Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spread within the hospital setting is essential if staff are to be adequately protected, effective infection control measures are to be implemented and nosocomial transmission is to be prevented. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on environmental surfaces around hospitalised patients, with and without respiratory symptoms, was investigated. Environmental sampling was carried out within eight hospitals in England during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Samples were analysed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation assays. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 30 (8.9%) of 336 environmental surfaces. Ct values ranged from 28.8 to 39.1 equating to 2.2 x 105 to 59 genomic copies/swab. Concomitant bacterial counts were low, suggesting the cleaning performed by nursing and domestic staff across all eight hospitals was effective. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in four of 55 air samples taken < 1 m from four different patients. In all cases, the concentration of viral RNA was low and ranged from < 10 to 460 genomic copies per m3 of air. Infectious virus was not recovered from any of the PCR positive samples analysed. Effective cleaning can reduce the risk of fomite (contact) transmission but some surface types may facilitate the survival, persistence and/or dispersal of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of low or undetectable concentrations of viral RNA in the air supports current guidance on the use of specific PPE ensembles for aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures.",Ginny Moore; Helen Rickard; David Stevenson; Paz Aranega Bou; James Pitman; Ant Crook; Katherine Davies; Antony Spencer; Chris Burton; Linda Easterbrook; Hannah E Love; Sian Summers; Stephen R Welch; Nadina Wand; Katy-Anne Thompson; Thomas Pottage; Kevin S Richards; Jake Dunning; Allan Bennett,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20183459,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20191411,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
351,"Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with LamPORE, a high-throughput platform combining loop-mediated isothermal amplification and nanopore sequencing","LamPORE is a novel diagnostic platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification with nanopore sequencing, which could potentially be used to analyse thousands of samples per day on a single instrument. We evaluated the performance of LamPORE against RT-PCR using RNA extracted from spiked respiratory samples and from stored nose and throat swabs collected at two UK hospitals. The limit of detection of LamPORE was 7-10 genome copies/microlitre of extracted RNA. This is above the limit achievable by RT-PCR but was not associated with a significant reduction of sensitivity in clinical samples. Positive clinical specimens came mostly from patients with acute symptomatic infection, and among these LamPORE had a diagnostic sensitivity of 99.1% (226/228 [95% CI 96.9-99.9%]). Among negative clinical specimens, including 153 with other respiratory pathogens detected, LamPORE had a diagnostic specificity of 99.6% (278/279 [98.0-100.0%]). Overall, 1.4% (7/514 [0.5-2.9]) of samples produced an indeterminate result on first testing, and repeat LamPORE testing on the same RNA extract had a reproducibility of 96.8% (478/494 [94.8-98.1]). This indicates that LamPORE has a similar performance to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, and offers a promising approach to high-throughput testing.",Leon Peto; Gillian Rodger; Daniel P Carter; Karen L Osman; Mehmet Yavuz; Katie Johnson; Mohammad Raza; Matthew D Parker; Matthew D Wyles; Monique Andersson; Anita Justice; Alison Vaughan; Sarah Hoosdally; Nicole Stoesser; Philippa C Matthews; David W Eyre; Timothy EA Peto; Miles W Carroll; Thushan I de Silva; Derrick W Crook; Cariad M Evans; Steven T Pullan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20183459,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20195370,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
352,Epidemiological characterization of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and positivity in subsequent RT-PCR tests in the United Arab Emirates,"Background COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases could be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the identified COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases are yet to be characterized. In this study, we characterized the first cohort of COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases reported in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE, according to symptomatic state, and identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. Also, the strength of association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was examined and quantified. Method We analyzed data collected from the first cohort of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the health authorities in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE between February 28 and April 08, 2020. Self-reported sociodemographic, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 1,249 COVID-19 cases were analyzed according to symptomatic state (symptomatic and asymptomatic). After the first RT-PCR confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent testing rounds were also analyzed. Results A total of 791 confirmed cases with a mean age of 35.6 years (range: 1-81 years) and information on the symptomatic state were analyzed. Nearly, 56.0% were asymptomatic cases. The most frequent two symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). The mean age of symptomatic (36.3 year, 12.6SD) was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases (34.5 year, 12.7SD). Compared to non-working populations, working in public places (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in the aviation and tourism sector (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40), were independently associated with the symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 5% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared to asymptomatic, symptomatic COVID-19 cases had consistent odds of two or more of testing positive to COVID-19 in three subsequent testing rounds. Conclusions A substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi Emirate was asymptomatic. Quarantine of asymptomatic cases along with prevention measures and raising awareness of populations working in high-risk settings is warranted. Further, follow up research is needed to understand viral clearance and clinical outcomes according to the symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases.",Rami H.

354,"Safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine candidate: interim results of a phase 1/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

355,Review of clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of COVID-19 in children-Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of various clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases were searched to include studies conducted between January 1, 2020, and July 15, 2020 which reported data about clinical characteristics and laboratory findings in laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Random effects meta-analysis using generalized linear mixed models was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: The most prevalent symptom of COVID-19 in children was 46.17% (95%CI 39.18-53.33%), followed by cough (40.15%, 95%CI 34.56-46.02%). Less common symptoms were found to be dyspnea, vomiting, nasal congestion/rhinorrhea, diarrhea, sore throat/pharyngeal congestion, headache, and fatigue. The prevalence of asymptomatic children was 17.19% (95%CI 11.02-25.82%). The most prevalent laboratory findings in COVID-19 children were elevated Creatinine Kinase (26.86%, 95%CI 16.15-41.19%) and neutropenia (25.76%, 95%CI 13.96-42.58%). These were followed by elevated LDH, thrombocytosis, lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated D Dimer, Elevated CRP, elevated ESR, leukocytosis, elevated AST and leukopenia.

356,Suitability of Two Rapid Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Assays for Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Activity of Sera,"Purpose: Assessment of commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for their capacity to provide reliable information on sera neutralizing activity is an emerging need. We evaluated the performance of two commercially-available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC) (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Patients and Methods: Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). Results: Overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM and 92.2% for the NtAb assay. Sensitivity increased for all assays in sera collected beyond day 14 after symptoms onset (93.9%, 79.6%,93.9% and 93.9%, respectively). Reactivities equal to or more intense than the positive control line ([&ge;]2+) in the Wondfo assay had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 96.4% for high NtAb50 titers ([&ge;]1/160). Conclusions: Our findings support the use of LFIC assays evaluated herein, particularly the Wondfo test, for COVID-19 diagnosis.

357,Genetic mechanisms of critical illness in Covid-19,"The subset of patients who develop critical illness in Covid-19 have extensive inflammation affecting the lungs and are strikingly different from other patients: immunosuppressive therapy benefits critically-ill patients, but may harm some non-critical cases. Since susceptibility to life-threatening infections and immune-mediated diseases are both strongly heritable traits, we reasoned that host genetic variation may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development in Covid-19. GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care, genomicc.org) is a global collaborative study to understand the genetic basis of critical illness. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2790 critically-ill Covid-19 patients from 208 UK intensive care units (ICUs), representing >95% of all ICU beds. Random controls were drawn from three distinct UK population studies. We identify and replicate several novel genome-wide significant associations including variants chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 x 10-12), within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), and at chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, P = 4.99 x 10-8) in the interferon receptor IFNAR2. Consistent with our focus on extreme disease in younger patients with less comorbidity, we detect a stronger signal at the known 3p21.31 locus than previous studies (rs73064425, P = 1.2 x 10-27). We identify potential targets for repurposing of existing licensed medications. Using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease. Transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19. We detected genome-wide significant gene-level associations for genes with central roles in viral restriction (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3). These results identify specific loci associated with life-threatening disease, and potential targets for host-directed therapies.

358,Implications of Monsoon Season & UVB Radiation for COVID-19 in India,"Background: India has recorded 66,333 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 2 September 2020. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India. Methods: We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. Findings: After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly due to lower UVB exposure. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.",Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath; Lennart Kraft,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200055,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200576,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a sample of COVID-19 inpatients across four different hospitals of Bangladesh between April 1st and June 30, 2020. Variation in clinical characteristics, contact history, comorbidities, treatment pattern, and long-term complications were investigated. Results: There were 734 COVID-19 presentations in this study of which 19.8% of patients had diabetes. 76% were male and 85% of the patients had been administered with all vaccine doses during childhood. The most frequently occurring blood groups among patients with diabetes were B (+) ve (35%) and O (+) ve (31%). Among biochemical parameters, glucose, D-dimer, C- reactive protein (CRP) and Troponin levels were significantly elevated amidst the cohort with diabetes. The frequency of insulin dependent individuals increased three-fold during COVID-19. A number of COVID-19 patients with diabetes have been suffering from long term complications post recovery including pain, discomfort, memory loss and sleep disturbance.

360,First phylogenetic analysis of Malian SARS-CoV-2 sequences provide molecular insights into the genomic diversity of the Sahel region,"We are currently facing a pandemic of COVID-19, caused by a spillover from an animal-originating coronavirus to humans occuring in the Wuhan region, China, in December 2019. From China the virus has spread to 188 countries and regions worldwide, reaching the Sahel region on the 2nd of March 2020. Since whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is very crucial to understand the spreading dynamics of the ongoing pandemic, but only limited sequence data is available from the Sahel region to date, we have focused our efforts on generating the first Malian sequencing data available. Screening of 217 Malian patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 38 positive isolates from which 21 whole genome sequences were generated. Our analysis shows that both, the early A (19B) and the fast evolving B (20A/C) clade, are present in Mali indicating multiple and independent introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 to the Sahel region.",Bourema Kouriba; Angela Duerr; Alexandra Rehn; Abdoul Karim Sangare; Brehima Youssouf Traoure; Malena S Bestehorn-Willmann; Judicael LJ Ouedraogo; Asli Heitzer; Elisabeth Sogodogo; Abderrhamane Maiga; Mathias C Walter; Fee Zimmermann; Roman Woelfel; Markus H Antwerpen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20165639,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20165639,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
361,Evidence for and level of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection: the ten-community study,"Background: Qatar experienced a large severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic that disproportionately affected the craft and manual workers (CMWs) who constitute 60% of the population. This study aimed to investigate level of immunity in communities within this population as well as infection exposure required to achieve herd immunity. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean infection positivity was 69.5% (95% CI: 62.8-75.9%). Only five infections were ever severe and one was ever critical, an infection severity rate of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Conclusions: Based on an extended range of epidemiological measures, active infection is rare in these communities with limited if any sustainable infection transmission for clusters to occur. At least some CMW communities in Qatar have reached or nearly reached herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a proportion of ever infection of 65-70%.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

362,Quantifying the impact of quarantine duration on COVID-19 transmission,"The numbers of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are increasing in many places. Consequently, the number of individuals placed into quarantine is increasing too. The large number of individuals in quarantine has high societal and economical costs. There is ongoing debate about the duration of quarantine, particularly since the fraction of individuals in quarantine who eventually test positive is perceived as being low. We present a mathematical model that uses empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects transmission. We use this model to examine two quarantine scenarios: traced contacts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and returning travellers. We quantify the impact of shortening the quarantine duration in terms of prevented transmission and the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine. We also consider the impact of i) test-and-release strategies; ii) reinforced hygiene measures upon release after a negative test; iii) the development of symptoms during quarantine; iv) the relationship between quarantine duration and adherence; and v) the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected. When considering the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine, we find that the diminishing impact of longer quarantine on transmission prevention may support a quarantine duration below 10 days. This ratio can be increased by implementing a test-and-release strategy, and this can be even further strengthened by reinforced hygiene measures post-release. We also find that unless a test-and-release strategy is considered, the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected does not affect the optimal duration of quarantine under our utility metric. Ultimately, we show that there are quarantine strategies based on a test-and-release protocol that, from an epidemiological viewpoint, perform almost as well as the standard 10 day quarantine, but with a lower cost in terms of person days spent in quarantine. This applies to both travellers and contacts, but the specifics depend on the context.",Peter Ashcroft; Sonja Lehtinen; Daniel C Angst; Nicola Low; Sebastian Bonhoeffer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200543,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201061,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
363,Impact of COVID-19 on the mortality rates for the resident population of the Umbria region in Italy,"The mortality figures related to the coronavirus pandemic has been the topic of debate lately. Several hypothesis are made regarding the expected number of deaths in a region but there are various factors governing the same. In this paper, we have discussed the mortality figures in the Umbria region after analyzing the data from the national Health registry between December 2019 to April 2020; the period of infection and its comparison with the data from previous five years. The factors governing these figures were studied including temperature, standard mortality rates, territorial distribution, death due to all cases as well as the non-COVID deaths. A sharp increase in mortality figures was observed for the month of march and low temperature also had a role to play. However the difference when compared to previous 5 years was not significant as was expected at the start of the study. A single factor cannot be responsible for the total mortality figures in a region as is frequently predicted.",Carla Bietta; Mattia Morini; Asiya Kamber Zaidi; Francesco Cozzolino; Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200543,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200667,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
364,Identifying gaps in COVID-19 health equity data reporting in Canada using a scorecard approach,"Objective: To assess health equity-oriented COVID-19 data reporting across Canadian provinces and territories, using a scorecard approach. Method: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 ""overall"" indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120 ""equity-related"" indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. Results: Overall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests, hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 53%, ""B"") than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, ""D""). Only British Columbia and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' individual-level immigration status, race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care settings and detention facilities. Conclusion: Socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada.

365,On the Analysis of Mortality Risk Factors for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: a Data-driven Study Using the Major Brazilian Database,"Background: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in a brief period of a few months after the first officially registered case. The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. Methods: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe, 2020) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26 to August 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. Results: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the mortality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with heart disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high mortality rate of around 50% was observed. The ICU admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.",Fernanda Sumika Hojo Souza; Natália Satchiko Hojo-Souza; Ben Dêivide de Oliveira Batista; Cristiano Maciel da Silva; Daniel Ludovico Guidoni,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200766,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True

368,What have we learned about positive changes experienced during COVID-19 lockdown? Evidence of the social patterning of change,"Background: Multiple studies have highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 and its particular effects on vulnerable sub-populations. Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. Methods: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9-12 of a national lockdown. Participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. Results: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. Conclusion: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.",Lynn Williams; Lesley Rollins; David Young; Leanne Fleming; Madeleine Grealy; Xanne Janssen; Alison Kirk; Bradley MacDonald; Paul Flowers,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200147,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200865,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True

Increasing infection rates in health professionals can lead to the collapse of the health system and further worsen the pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 in health workers in Sergipe, Brazil. Methods: The targeted tests involved health professionals working on the front line to combat COVID-19. The samples were collected in the month of June, in six hospital units in the state of Sergipe. Results: 471 health professionals were tested. Of these, 28 workers (5.95%) tested positive for IgM and 64 (13.59%) tested positive for IgG. 9 workers (1.91%) tested positive for IgM and were also positive for IgG. Discussion: Health workers must be monitored constantly, because if they are infected, they can spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members.

370,"A low-cost, rapidly scalable, emergency use ventilator for the COVID-19 crisis","For the past 50 years, positive pressure ventilation has been a cornerstone of treatment for respiratory failure. Consensus surrounding the epidemiology of respiratory failure has permitted a relatively good fit between the supply of ventilators and the demand. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for mechanical ventilators well beyond supply. Respiratory failure complicates most critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is characterized by highly heterogeneous pulmonary parenchymal involvement, profound hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular injury. The profound increase in the incidence of respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and those with the necessary skills to treat. While most traditional ventilators rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas mixture delivered to a patient, the current emergency climate has catalyzed alternative designs that might enable greater flexibility in terms of supply chain, manufacturing, storage and maintenance. Design considerations of these 'emergency response' ventilators have generally fallen into two categories: those that rely on mechanical compression of a known volume of gas and those powered by an internal compressor to deliver time cycled pressure- or volume-limited gas to the patient. The present work introduces a low-cost, ventilator designed and built in accordance with the Emergence Use guidance provided by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wherein an external gas supply feeds into the ventilator and time limited flow interruption guarantees tidal volume. The goal of this device is to allow a patient to be treated by a single ventilator platform, capable of supporting the various treatment paradigms during a potential COVID-19 related hospitalization. This is a unique aspect of this design as it attempts to become a one-device-one-visit solution to the problem. The device is designed as a single use ventilator that is sufficiently robust to treat a patient being mechanically ventilated. The overall design philosophy and its applicability in this new crisis-laden world view is first described, followed by both bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision, capability, safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ventilator is shown to perform in a range of critical requirements listed in the FDA emergency regulations and can safely and effectively ventilate a porcine subject. As of August 2020, only 13 emergency ventilators have been authorized by the FDA, and this work represents the first to publish animal data using the ventilator. This proof-of-concept provides support for this cost-effective, readily mass-produced ventilator that can be used to support patients when the demand for ventilators outstrips supply in hospital settings worldwide.

371,"When it is available, will we take it? Public perception of hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria","COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health threat facing mankind. There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. This study aims to understand the perception of the public towards hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in August 2020 across the 36 states of Nigeria using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. The results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.87%). Most of the respondents (385, 74.47%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance is unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.12%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.27%). There are significant association with the respondents age and having reservations toward vaccination [{chi}2= 19.0389 P-value=0.00] and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance [{chi}2=24.3316 P-value=0.00]. Furthermore, geographical location and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine [{chi}2=13.7786 P-value=0.02] are significantly associated.

We partially account for behavioral responses using Google mobility data. Our identification approach exploits variation in the timing of indoor face mask mandates staggered over two months in the 34 public health regions in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. We find that, in the first few weeks after implementation, mask mandates are associated with a reduction of 25 percent in the weekly number of new COVID-19 cases. Additional analysis with province-level data provides corroborating evidence. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that mandating indoor masks nationwide in early July could have reduced the weekly number of new cases in Canada by 25 to 40 percent in mid-August, which translates into 700 to 1,100 fewer cases per week.",Alexander Karaivanov; Shih En Lu; Hitoshi Shigeoka; Cong Chen; Stephanie Pamplona,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200006,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201178,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
373,Personal protective equipment for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers involved in emergency trauma surgery during the pandemic: an umbrella review,"Objective: The objective of this review was to summarise the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery. The purpose of the review was to inform recommendations for rational use of PPE for emergency surgery staff, particularly in low resources environments where PPE shortages and high costs are expected to hamper the safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) and affect the care of trauma patients. Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure. Inclusion criteria: This review included systematic reviews, experimental and observational studies evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was considered, as well as evidence from other viral outbreaks summarised and discussed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The risk of bias assessment of the included studies was planned with the AMSTAR II tool for systematic reviews, the RoBII tool for randomised controlled trials, and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies. Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction tool and summarised narratively. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for grading the certainty of the evidence was followed. Results: We identified 17 systematic reviews that fulfilled our selection criteria and were included for synthesis. We did not identify randomised controlled trials during COVID-19 or studies additional to those included in the reviews that discussed other similar viral respiratory illnesses. Conclusions: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs in the hospital setting. N95 and N95 equivalent respirators provided more protection and were found to halve the risk of COVID-19 contagion in HCWs from moderate and high-risk environments. Eye protection also offers additional security and is associated with reduced incidence of contagion. These effects apply to emergency trauma care. Decontamination and reuse appear as feasible, cost-effective measures that would likely help overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks are associated with a reduced risk of coronaviruses respiratory illness when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments, especially in aerosol-generating procedures, N95 respirators are associated with a more significant reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit.",Dylan Paul Griswold; Andres Gempeler; Angelos Kolias; Peter Hutchinson; Andres Rubiano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200006,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201293,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True

The objective of this study was to determine the health facility (HF) preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak from the perspective of RMNH providers and to determine what factors significantly predict this. An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from 1st to 21st July 2020 in Lagos state Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. Two hundred and fifty-six RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 39% felt moderate or extreme work-related burnout, 84% were moderately or extremely concerned about the availability of PPE and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were extremely satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation in the outcome variable. A one-unit increase in the level of satisfaction with the communication from HF management and level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness (OR 0.79-2.92, p<0.001 and 0.02-0.15 p<0.001 respectively).

375,COVID-19 mortality rate in Russia: forecasts and reality evaluation,"COVID-19 is an extremely dangerous disease that not only spreads quickly, but is also characterized by a high mortality rate. Therefore, predicting the number of deaths from the new coronavirus is an urgent task. The aim of the study is to analyze the factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rate in various countries, to predict direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation, and to estimate additional mortality during the pandemic based on the demographic data. The main research method is econometric modeling. Comparison of various data was also applied. The authors' calculations were based on data from the RSSS, the World Bank, as well as specialized sites with coronavirus statistics in Russia and in the world. A predictive estimation of the deceased number of people due to the pandemic in Russia was made. It is confirmed that the deaths proportion of the completed cases of the disease depends on the level of testing. It is shown that the revealed mortality of the disease depends on the proportion of completed cases, on the population age structure, and on how early the pandemic entered the country compared to the other countries. It is determined that the number of additional deaths due to the coronavirus is approximately 31 thousand people. The analysis revealed that the relatively low proportion of COVID in Russia is the result of a special approach to the cause of death determination. The mortality rate in Russia in April 2020 was about 3% higher than in April 2019. The share of the deceased health workers in the total coronavirus mortality in the Russian Federation is higher than in the developed countries, which indicates an underestimation of the data on COVID- 19 deaths in the Russian Federation, and the unsatisfactory quality of the Russian healthcare system. The number of direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation at the end of July was approximately 43 thousand people.",Marina Lifshits; Natalia Neklyudova,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200782,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201376,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True

377,Performance of a point of care test for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seroprevalence in blood donors and health care workers in Panama,"Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has reached 28 million cases worldwide in eight months. The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assay ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test sensitivity and specificity as well as the kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811- 0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement (87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)) was observed at 15 days post-symptom onset. We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Alcibiades Villarreal; Giselle Rangel; Xu Zhang; Digna Wong; Carolina De La Guardia; Gabrielle Britton; Patricia L.

We report an aptamer-based SARS-CoV-2 salivary antigen assay employing only low-cost reagents ($3.20/test) and an off-the-shelf glucometer. The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones providing an opportunity to integrate with contract tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic medical records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within one hour, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement).

Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19 admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Individuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period. The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n=134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever (54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158 (93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly. Conclusions: Susceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more in comorbid males.

381,Poor inhibitory control and stress as risk-factors for alcohol (mis)use during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a national cross-sectional study across four generations,"Background: The impact COVID-19 on the UK population's alcohol intake is unknown. We assessed change in alcohol-use and hazardous drinking during the first lockdown, and tested the hypothesis that variation would be predicted by stress and inhibitory-control. Methods: We interrogated cross-sectional data from the first sweep of the COVID-19 longitudinal survey, comprising 4 national cohorts (13 453 respondents, 19-62 years). Respondents self-reported their alcohol use, stress, and inhibitory control. We regressed change in drinking and alcohol misuse on stress and inhibitory control, adjusting for covariates to account for demographics. Findings: 29.08% 30-year-olds increased alcohol use post-COVID-19. Stress was a major contributing factor to increased alcohol use in 30-year olds (adjusted OR 3.92, 95% CI 1.17 - 13.15), as was inhibitory control in 19-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.23), 30-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.33) and 50-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.12). We identified several interactions between stress and inhibitory control in all age groups, suggesting a complex age-specific relationship between the risk factors and alcohol use and misuse during the pandemic. Interpretation: In the UK, alcohol use increased in up to 30% of the population during COVID-19, resulting from a combination of factors including poor inhibitory control and stress. It is critical in future lockdowns that clinicians and public health officials are aware of the challenges faced by different age groups, and prioritise and personalise interventions and prevention measures appropriately.

382,Predictors of Incident Viral Symptoms Ascertained in the Era of Covid-19,"Background: In the absence of universal testing, effective therapies, or vaccines, identifying risk factors for viral infection, particularly readily modifiable exposures and behaviors, is required to identify effective strategies against viral infection and transmission. Methods: We conducted a world-wide mobile application-based prospective cohort study available to English speaking adults with a smartphone. We collected self-reported characteristics, exposures, and behaviors, as well as smartphone-based geolocation data. Our main outcome was incident symptoms of viral infection, defined as fevers and chills plus one other symptom previously shown to occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by daily surveys. Findings: Among 14, 335 participants residing in all 50 US states and 93 different countries followed for a median 21 days (IQR 10-26 days), 424 (3%) developed incident viral symptoms. In pooled multivariable logistic regression models, female biological sex (odds ration [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.39-2.20, p<0.001), anemia (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.16-1.81, p=0.001), hypertension (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.68, p=0.007), cigarette smoking in the last 30 days (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.35-2.55, p<0.001), any viral symptoms among household members 6-12 days prior (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.67-2.55, p<0.001), and the maximum number of individuals the participant interacted with within 6 feet in the past 6-12 days (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.25, p<0.001) were each associated with a higher risk of developing viral symptoms. Conversely, a higher subjective social status (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, p<0.001), at least weekly exercise (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47-0.70, p<0.001), and sanitizing one's phone (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99, p=0.037) were each associated with a lower risk of developing viral symptoms.

Due to limited availability of testing, only a non-random subset of the population can get tested. Hence, the reported test counts are subject to a large degree of selection bias. We consider an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model under both selection bias and misclassification. We derive closed form expression for the basic reproduction number under such data anomalies using the next generation matrix method. We conduct extensive simulation studies to quantify the effect of misclassification and selection on the resultant estimation and prediction of future case counts. Finally we apply the methods to reported case-death-recovery count data from India, a nation with more than 5 million cases reported over the last seven months. We show that correcting for misclassification and selection can lead to more accurate prediction of case-counts (and death counts) using the observed data as a beta tester. The model also provides an estimate of undetected infections and thus an under-reporting factor. For India, the estimated under-reporting factor for cases is around 21 and for deaths is around 6.

385,Behavioural barriers to COVID-19 testing in Australia,"Background: The current suppression strategy for COVID-19 in Australia is dependent on people getting tested and self-isolating while they have COVID-19 symptoms. However, there is very little research on the behaviours and behavioural barriers involved in getting tested, both in Australia and worldwide, despite there being some evidence that these barriers do exist. Methods: The Sydney Health Literacy Lab (SHeLL) has been conducting a national longitudinal survey in Australia since April 2020. A list of testing barriers was included in Wave 3 in June 2020 (n=1369), along with intentions to test and self-isolate if symptomatic. Open responses were also collected. The test barriers identified were categorised using the COM-B framework. Results: Only 49% of people strongly agreed they would get tested if they had COVID-19 symptoms, but most people agreed to some extent that they would get tested (96%). The most common barriers selected from the list provided were that testing is painful (11%), not knowing how to get tested (7%), and worry about getting infected at the testing centre (5%). Many participants (10%) indicated other reasons, and open responses included many additional barriers to testing than those provided in the initial list. These covered all components of the COM-B model.

386,Psychological preparedness for pandemic (COVID-19) management: Perceptions of nurses and nursing students in India,"Introduction: The growing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great threat to millions of people worldwide. Nurses and nursing students are an important group of health professionals who are most likely to face many challenges in this unprecedented scenario. The present study aimed at exploring the perception of nurses and nursing students regarding psychological preparedness for the pandemic (COVID-19) management. Materials & Methods: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional online survey research design. Purposive sampling was used with an attempt to represent the entire nurses (i.e. nursing officers, nurse administrators and nursing teachers) and nursing students group of India. The survey link was shared to their email ID and they were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale (PPDTS)-Modified, General Self Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Optimism Scale and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRS). Totally 685 responses were received and 676 forms were completed which were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Results: The mean age of the subjects was 31.72 (SD=9.58) years. Around 20% of the subjects previously had some kind of psychological training and 4% of the subjects had taken care of persons with COVID-19. Findings revealed that mean score for PPDTS, GSE, BRCS and Optimism was 73.44 (SD=10.82, 33.19 (SD=5.23), 16.79 (SD=2.73) and 9.61 (SD=2.26) respectively indicating that the subjects had moderate level of psychological preparedness, self-efficacy and resilience but higher level of optimism. Psychological preparedness, self-efficacy, optimism and resilience were positively correlated to each other. Self- efficacy, optimism, and resilience emerged as predictors of psychological preparedness. Conclusion: The findings suggested that self-efficacy, optimism and resilience can be considered as predictors for psychological preparedness in pandemic management. Appropriate training could influence self-efficacy while programs addressing resilience and coping may strengthen psychological preparedness which can help in further management of ongoing pandemic.",Sailaxmi Gandhi; Maya Sahu; Radhakrishnan Govindan; Prasanthi Nattala; Paulomi M Sudhir; Rathi Balachandran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201293,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201301,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
387,Outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral clades in COVID-19,"Background The COVID-19 epidemic of 2019-20 is due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Following first case description in December, 2019 this virus has infected over 10 million individuals and resulted in at least 500,000 deaths world-wide. The virus is undergoing rapid mutation, with two major clades of sequence variants emerging. This study sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants are associated with differing outcomes among COVID-19 patients in a single medical system. Methods Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was obtained from isolates collected from patients registered in the University of Washington Medicine health system between March 1 and April 15, 2020. Demographic and baseline medical data along with outcomes of hospitalization and death were collected. Statistical and machine learning models were applied to determine if viral genetic variants were associated with specific outcomes of hospitalization or death. Findings Full length SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained 190 subjects with clinical outcome data. 35 (18.4%) were hospitalized and 14 (7.4%) died from complications of infection. A total of 289 single nucleotide variants were identified. Clustering methods demonstrated two major viral clades, which could be readily distinguished by 12 polymorphisms in 5 genes. A trend toward higher rates of hospitalization of patients with Clade 2 was observed (p=0.06). Machine learning models utilizing patient demographics and co-morbidities achieved area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.93 for predicting hospitalization. Addition of viral clade or sequence information did not significantly improve models for outcome prediction. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 shows substantial sequence diversity in a community-based sample. Two dominant clades of virus are in circulation. Among patients sufficiently ill to warrant testing for virus, no significant difference in outcomes of hospitalization or death could be discerned between clades in this sample. Major risk factors for hospitalization and death for either major clade of virus include patient age and comorbid conditions.",Kenji Nakamichi; Jolie Zhu Shen; Cecilia S Lee; Aaron Y Lee; Emma Adaline Roberts; Paul D Simonson; Pavitra Roychoudhury; Jessica G Andriesen; April K Randhawa; Patrick C Mathias; Alex Greninger; Keith R Jerome; Russell N Van Gelder,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201293,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201228,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True

389,A high-affinity RBD-targeting nanobody improves fusion partner's potency against SARS-CoV-2,"A key step to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the attachment of its Spike receptor-binding domain (S RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. Considerable research have been devoted to the development of neutralizing antibodies, including llama-derived single-chain nanobodies, to target the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and to block ACE2-RBD binding. Simple and effective strategies to increase potency are desirable for such studies when antibodies are only modestly effective. Here, we identify and characterize a high-affinity synthetic nanobody (sybody, SR31) as a fusion partner to improve the potency of RBM-antibodies. Crystallographic studies reveal that SR31 binds to RBD at a conserved and  greasy site distal to RBM. Although SR31 distorts RBD at the interface, it does not perturb the RBM conformation, hence displaying no neutralizing activities itself. However, fusing SR31 to two modestly neutralizing sybodies dramatically increases their affinity for RBD and neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Our work presents a tool protein and an efficient strategy to improve nanobody potency.",Hebang Yao; Hongmin Cai; Tingting Li; Bingjie Zhou; Wenming Qin; Dimitri Lavillette; Dianfan Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201319,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312595,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
390,Sequence Analysis for SNP Detection and Phylogenetic Reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 Isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 Cases,"BackgroundCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the Family Coronaviridae, Genus Betacoronavirus. In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) characterized by severe respiratory symptoms was discovered. The causative pathogen was a novel coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV and later as SARS-CoV-2. Within two months of its discovery, COVID-19 became a pandemic causing widespread morbidity and mortality.

MethodologyWhole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were retrieved by downloading from GISAID database. A total of 18 sequences that satisfied quality assurance (length [&ge;] 29700 nts and number of unknown bases denoted as  N [&le;] 5%) were used for the study. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done in MAFFT (Version 7.471) while SNP calling was implemented in DnaSP (Version 6.12.03) respectively and then visualized in Jalview (Version 2.11.1.0). Phylogenetic analysis was with MEGA X software.

ResultsNigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions. A total of 66 SNPs were identified out of which 31 were informative. Nucleotide diversity assessment gave Pi = 0.00048 and average SNP frequency of 2.22 SNPs per 1000 nts. Non-coding genomic regions particularly 5UTR and 3UTR had a SNP density of 3.77 and 35.4 respectively. The region with the highest SNP density was ORF10 with a frequency of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts). Majority (72.2%) of viruses in Nigeria are of L lineage with preponderance of D614G mutation which accounted for 11 (61.1%) out of the 18 viral sequences. Nigeria SARS-CoV-2 revealed 3 major clades namely Oyo, Ekiti and Osun on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.

Conclusion and RecommendationNigerian SARS-CoV-2 reveals high mutation rate together with preponderance of L lineage and D614G mutants. Implication of these mutations for SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the need for more aggressive testing and treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria is discussed. Additionally, attempt to produce testing kits for COVID-19 in Nigeria should consider the conserved regions identified in this study. Strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measure is recommended in view of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clustering pattern, which suggests intensive community transmission possibly rooted in communal culture characteristic of many ethnicities in Nigeria.",Idowu A.

Rapid spread of virus through populations poses an enormous challenge for outbreak control. Like all respiratory viruses, the most recent novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, initiates infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Infected individuals are often asymptomatic, yet highly infectious and readily transmit virus. A therapy that restricts initial replication in the URT has the potential to prevent progression of severe lower respiratory tract disease as well as limiting person-to-person transmission.

We show that prophylactic intra-nasal administration of the TLR2/6 agonist INNA-051 in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret infection model effectively reduces levels of viral RNA in the nose and throat. The results of our study support clinical development of a therapy based on prophylactic TLR2/6 innate immune activation in the URT to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and provide protection against COVID-19.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

392,SARS-CoV-2 induces double-stranded RNA-mediated innate immune responses in respiratory epithelial derived cells and cardiomyocytes,"Coronaviruses are adept at evading and/or antagonizing double-stranded RNA-induced host antiviral pathways, including interferon signaling, OAS-RNase L and PKR while robust cytokine responses characterize severe coronavirus disease. Knowledge of how newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 interacts with these pathways is minimal. SARS-CoV-2 readily infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells(iAT2) and cardiomyocytes(iCM). Robust activation of interferons or RNase L is not observed, while PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 and A549ACE2 lung derived cell lines, activation of all pathways is observed, similar to a mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Moreover, increased replication in RNASEL knockout A549ACE2 cells, implicates RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 is less adept at antagonizing these host defense pathways compared to other coronaviruses, the innate immune response is still generally weak. These host-virus interactions may contribute to the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",Yize Li; David Renner; Courtney E Comar; Jillian Whelan; Hanako Reyes; Fabian Leonardo Cardenas-Diaz; Rachel Truitt; Li Hui Tan; Beihua Dong; Konstantinos Dionysios Alysandratose; Jesse Huang; James N Palmer; Nithin D Adappa; Michael A Kohanski; Darrell N Kotton; Robert H Silverman; Wenli Yang; Edward Morrisey; Noam Cohen; Susan R Weiss,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.309914,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312553,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
393,Cyclooxgenase-2 is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection but does not affect viral entry or replication,"Identifying drugs that regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its symptoms has been a pressing area of investigation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). PGE2, one of the most abundant PGs, has diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown that NSAID treatment or inhibition of PGE2 receptor signaling leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, thus raising concerns that NSAIDs could increase susceptibility to infection. COX/PGE2 signaling has also been shown to regulate the replication of many viruses, but it is not yet known whether it plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this study was to dissect the effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 in terms of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 upregulation in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2/PGE2 signaling by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling driven by SARS-CoV-2 may instead play a role in regulating the lung inflammation and injury observed in COVID-19 patients.

ImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NSAIDs function by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These enzymes are critical for the generation of prostaglandins, lipid molecules with diverse roles in maintaining homeostasis as well as regulating the inflammatory response. While COX-1/COX-2 signaling pathways have been shown to affect the replication of many viruses, their effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 expression in both human cell culture systems and mouse models. However, inhibition of COX-2 activity with NSAIDs did not affect SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling may instead regulate the lung inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients, which is an important area for future studies.",Jennifer S.

394,A potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibody that reduces viral burden and disease severity in Syrian hamsters,"The emergence of COVID-19 has led to a pandemic that has caused millions of cases of disease, variable morbidity and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Currently, only remdesivir and dexamethasone have demonstrated limited efficacy, only slightly reducing disease burden, thus novel approaches for clinical management of COVID-19 are needed. We identified a panel of human monoclonal antibody clones from a yeast display library with specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain that neutralized the virus in vitro. Administration of the lead antibody clone to Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced viral load and histopathology score in the lungs. Moreover, the antibody interrupted monocyte infiltration into the lungs, which may have contributed to the reduction of disease severity by limiting immunopathological exacerbation. The use of this antibody could provide an important therapy for treatment of COVID-19 patients.",Anna Fagre; John Manhard; Rachel Adams; Miles Eckley; Shijun Zhan; Juliette Lewis; Savanna M Rocha; Catherine Woods; Karina Kuo; Wuxiang Liao; Lin Li; Adam Corper; Dilip Challa; Emily Mount; Christine Tumanut; Ronald B Tjalkens; Tawfik Aboelleil; Xiaomin Fan; Tony Schountz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312553,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313601,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
395,Nitazoxanide and JIB-04 have broad-spectrum antiviral activity and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture and coronavirus pathogenesis in a pig model,"Pathogenic coronaviruses represent a major threat to global public health. Here, using a recombinant reporter virus-based compound screening approach, we identified several small-molecule inhibitors that potently block the replication of the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two compounds, nitazoxanide and JIB-04 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of 4.90 M and 0.69 M, respectively, with specificity indices of greater than 150. Both inhibitors had in vitro antiviral activity in multiple cell types against some DNA and RNA viruses, including porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. In an in vivo porcine model of coronavirus infection, administration of JIB-04 reduced virus infection and associated tissue pathology, which resulted in improved body weight gain and survival. These results highlight the potential utility of nitazoxanide and JIB-04 as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens.",Juhee Son; Shimeng Huang; Qiru Zeng; Traci L.

This coincided with major developments in genome-wide gene and protein expression analysis, resulting in a wealth of datasets in the public domain. Seven such in vitro studies were selected for comparative bioinformatic analysis through the VirOmics Playground, a user-friendly visualisation and exploration platform we recently developed. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the data sets, several commonalities could be observed across studies and species.

397,"SARS-CoV-2 and Malayan pangolin coronavirus infect human endoderm, ectoderm and induced lung progenitor cells","Since the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in several somatic cells, little is known about the infection of SASRS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V). Here we present for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2 results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication, indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection. Heparin treatment blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. The potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such as GX_P2V infection in hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely monitored.",Kuanhui Xiang; Bixia Hong; Xinyuan Lai; Yangzhen Chen; Tianming Luo; Xiaoping An; Lihua Song; Hui Zhuang; Huahao Fan; Tong Li; Yi-Gang Tong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312769,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313270,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
398,Rapid behavioral response of urban birds to covid-19 lockdown,"Biodiversity is threatened by the current exponential growth of urban areas. However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the adaptive mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds response to the Spanish population lockdown by using more than 200,000 bird records collected by a citizen science project. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds daily routines in response to quitter and less crowded cities. In conclusion, urban birds show high behavioral plasticity to rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions, as those imposed by the COVID-19.",Oscar Gordo; Lluis Brotons; Sergi Herrando; Gabriel Gargallo,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313601,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313148,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
399,Risk factors for mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"Objectives To develop a prognostic model to identify and quantify risk factors for mortality among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Design Retrospective cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to either training (80%) or test (20%) sets. The training set was used to fit a multivariable logistic regression. Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores, and calibration plots in the test set. Setting Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset. Participants 17,086 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between February 20, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Main outcome measure All-cause mortality during hospital stay. Results The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index = 0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were generally similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index = 0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index = 0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.2% for 18-year olds, 8.4% for 55-year olds, and 28.6% for 85-year olds. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 21.7% by March to 13.3% by May. Conclusion Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white blood cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably. The model had good discrimination and was reasonably well calibrated, suggesting that it may be useful for assessment of prognosis.",Devin Incerti; Shemra Rizzo; Xiao Li; Lisa Lindsay; Vince Yau; Dan Keebler; Jenny Chia; Larry Tsai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313601,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20196204,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True
400,Prospective comparison of saliva and nasopharyngeal swab sampling for mass screening for COVID-19,"Current testing for COVID-19 relies on quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Saliva samples have advantages regarding ease and painlessness of collection, which does not require trained staff and may allow self-sampling. We enrolled 776 persons at various field-testing sites and collected nasopharyngeal and pooled saliva samples. 162 had a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR, 61% were mildly symptomatic and 39% asymptomatic. The sensitivity of RT-PCR on saliva samples versus nasopharygeal swabs varied depending on the patient groups considered or on Ct thresholds. There were 10 (6.2%) patients with a positive saliva sample and a negative nasopharyngeal swab, all of whom had Ct values<25. For symptomatic patients for whom the interval between symptoms onset and sampling was <10 days sensitivity was 77% but when excluding persons with isolated Ngen positivity (54/162), sensitivity was 90%. In asymptomatic patients, the sensitivity was only 24%. When we looked at patients with Cts <30, sensitivity was 83% or 88.9% when considering 2 genes. The relatively good performance for patients with low Cts suggests that Saliva testing could be a useful and acceptable tool to identify infectious persons in mass screening contexts, a strategically important task for contact tracing and isolation in the community.",- COVISAL Guyane; mathieu nacher; magalie demar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20150961,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True
401,Epidemiological measures for informing the general public during the SARS-CoV-2-outbreak: simulation study about bias by incomplete case-detection,"During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, several epidemiological measures, such as cumulative case-counts, incidence rates, effective reproduction numbers and doubling times, have been used to inform the general public and to justify interventions such as lockdown. During the course of the epidemic, it has been very likely that not all infectious people have been identified, which lead to incomplete case-detection. Apart from asymptomatic infections, possible reasons for incomplete case-detection are availability of test kits and changes in test policies during the course of the epidemic. So far, it has not been examined how biased the reported epidemiological measures are in the presence of incomplete case detection. In this work, we assess the four frequently used measures with respect to incomplete case-detection: 1) cumulative case-count, 2) incidence rate, 3) effective reproduction number and 4) doubling time. We apply an age-structured SIR model to simulate a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak followed by a lockdown in a hypothetical population. Different scenarios about temporal variations in case-detection are applied to the four measures during outbreak and lockdown. The biases resulting from incomplete case-detection on the four measures are compared. It turns out that the most frequently used epidemiological measure, the cumulative case count is most prone to bias in all of our settings. The effective reproduction number is the least biased measure. With a view to future reporting about this or other epidemics, we recommend to use of the effective reproduction number for informing the general public and policy makers.",Ralph Brinks; Helmut Kuechenhoff; Joerg Timm; Tobias Kurth; Annika Hoyer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312165,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200089,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True
402,Comparative Effectiveness of Famotidine in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"Background: Famotidine has been posited as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death; and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users or famotidine non-users separately. Methods: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. Study population were COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing one of the three drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine non-user group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient prior to or on the day of admission. Time-at-risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score (PS) model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. Results: We identified 2193 users of PPI, 5950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1816 users of famotidine and 26,820 non-famotidine users. After PS stratification, the hazard ratios for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18); vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39); vs hydroxychloroquine:1.03 (0.85-1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive services use.

We aim to assess the clinical and analytical performance of three commercial serological assays of SARS-CoV-2, comparing three anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG ELISA and identifying the seroconversion and seroprevalence in our population. A cross sectional study conducted from April 2020 to July 2020 at National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation Karachi, Pakistan with sample size of 404, enrolled consecutively. Participants were categorized into four groups namely convalescent plasmadonors (CPDs n=239), health care professionals (HCPs n=44), healthy blood donors (HBDs n=70) and from community (n=51). We evaluated the performance of Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) assay on Cobas-e411 by Roche, three qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG enzyme linked imunosorbant assay (ELISA) by (Generic assays, Euroimmun & Omega diagnostics) ,one quantitative ELISA assay by AESKU Diagnostics and two immune chromatography(ICT) kits namely InstaTestTM by CORTEZ and TEST IT by TURKLAB. From total 404 subjects, 322 (83.5%) were males. Mean age was 36.79 plus minus 11.95 years. Among 239 in CPDs group, 202(84.5%) showed positive antibodies by ECLIA.

Then, this study aimed to model and forecast of COVID-19 new cases in these top 10 infected African countries. Methods: In this study, the COVID 19 new cases data have been modeled and forecasted using curve estimation regression and time series models for these top 10 infected African countries from Feb 14 to Sep 6, 2020. Results: From July to August, the prevalence of COVID-19 cumulative cases was declined in South Africa, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Cameron, Nigeria, and Algeria by 31%, 26%, 22%, 20%, 14%, 12%, and 4%, respectively. But, it was highly raised in Ethiopia and Morocco by 41%, and 38% in this period, respectively. In Kenya, it was raised only by 1%. In this study, the cubic regression models for the ln(COVID-19 new cases) data were relatively the best fit for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. And, the quadratic regression models for the data were the best fit for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire and Ghana. The Algeria data was followed the logarithmic regression model. In the time series analysis, the Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa COVID-19 new cases data have fitted the ARIMA (0,1,0), ARIMA (0,1,0), and ARIMA (0,1,14) models, respectively. The Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana, and Nigeria data have fitted the simple exponential smoothing models. The Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco data have followed the Damped trend, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively. In the analysis, the trends of COVID-19 new cases will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia, and the trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana and Nigeria. But, it will be raised slightly for Egypt and Kenya, and significantly for Morocco and South Africa from September 7 to October 6, 2020. Conclusion: This study was conducted with the current measures; the forecasts and trends obtained may differ from the number of cases that occur in the future. Thus, the study finding should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in African countries. And, the researcher recommended that as many countries continue to relax restrictions on movement and mass gatherings, and more are opening their airspaces, and the countries other public and private sectors are reopening.

405,"CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID-19 PATIENTS IN LAGOS, NIGERIA: A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY","Introduction: COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving global situation, infecting over 25 million people and causing more than 850,000 deaths. Several signs and symptoms have been described to be characteristic of the disease. However, there is a dearth of report on the description of the clinical characteristics of the disease in patients from Nigeria. This study was designed to provide a description of the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Methods: This study is a case series that includes patients that are evaluated between June and August 30, 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient health records were reviewed and evaluated to describe the clinical characteristics on presentation. Results: A total of 154 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, with a mean age (S.D.) of 46.16 (13.701). Most of the patients survived (mortality rate of 2.6%), and were symptomatic (89.6%). There were more males (74.7%) than females, and the most common symptoms were fever, breathing difficulty, dry cough and malaise. Co-morbidities were also present in almost half of the study participants (49.4%). Conclusion: This study presents the most extensive description, to date, on the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria.

406,Modelling optimal vaccination strategy for SARS-CoV-2.,"The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted our vulnerability to novel infections. Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission- successfully reducing the reproductive number, R, below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial second wave. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and can avoid a second wave if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.",Sam Moore; Edward M Hill; Louise Dyson; Michael Tildesley; Matt J Keeling,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313148,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20194183,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True
407,Role of IgG against N-protein of SARS-CoV2 in COVID19 clinical outcomes,"The Nucleocapsid Protein (N Protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is located in the viral core. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting N protein is detectable in the serum of infected patients. The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor outcomes, including MICU admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off ratio (S/Co)> 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio> 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently associated with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital. This study recommends that titers of IgG targeting N-protein of SARS-CoV2 at admission is a prognostic factor for the clinical course of disease and should be measured in all patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.",Mayank Batra; Runxia Tian; Chongxu Zhang; Emile Clarence; Camila Sofia Sacher; Justin Nestor Miranda; Justin Rafa O De La Fuente; Megan Mathew; Desmond Green; Sayari Patel; Maria Virginia Perez Bastidas; Sara Haddadi; Mukunthan Murthi; Miguel Santiago Gonzalez; Shweta Kambali; Kayo HM Santos; Huda Asif; Farzaneh Modarresi; Mohammad Faghihi; Mehdi Mirsaeidi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313148,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20197251,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True

Though NIC is already FDA-approved, the oral formulation produces systemic drug levels that are too low to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. As an alternative, direct delivery of NIC to the respiratory tract as an aerosol could target the primary site of for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread.

Like most enveloped RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 uses a homotrimeric surface antigen to gain entry into host cells. Here we describe S-Trimer, a native-like trimeric subunit vaccine candidate for COVID-19 based on Trimer-Tag technology. Immunization of S-Trimer with either AS03 (oil-in-water emulsion) or CpG 1018 (TLR9 agonist) plus alum adjuvants induced high-levels of neutralizing antibodies and Th1-biased cellular immune responses in animal models. Moreover, rhesus macaques immunized with adjuvanted S-Trimer were protected from SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to vehicle controls, based on clinical observations and reduction of viral loads in lungs.

411,Hamster and ferret experimental infection with intranasal low dose of a single strain of SARS-CoV-2,"Understanding the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is key to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, in the case of severe illness but also when the disease is mild. The use of appropriate experimental animal models remains central in the in-vivo exploration of the physiopathology of infection and antiviral strategies. This study describes SARS-CoV-2 intra-nasal infection in ferrets and hamsters with low doses of low-passage SARS-CoV-2 clinical French isolate UCN19, describing infection levels, excretion, immune responses and pathological patterns in both animal species. Individual infection with 103 pfu SARS-CoV-2 induced a more severe disease in hamsters than in ferrets. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of hamsters but not of ferrets and in the brain (olfactive and/or spinal bulbs) of both species. Overall, the clinical disease remained mild, with serological responses detected from 7 days and 10 days post inoculation in hamsters and ferrets respectively. Virus became undetectable and pathology resolved within 14 days.

In search for therapeutic options, researchers have proposed resveratrol, a food supplement with known antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties as an advantageous antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection2-4. Here, we provide evidence that both resveratrol and its metabolically more stable structural analog, pterostilbene, exhibits potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Resveratrol and pterostilbene showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells and in human primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface system. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that both compounds actively interfere with the post-entry steps of virus replication cycle and their antiviral activity is long-lasting.

413,An evolutionary portrait of the progenitor SARS-CoV-2 and its dominant offshoots in COVID-19 pandemic,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, was quickly identified as the cause of COVID-19 disease soon after its earliest reports. Global sequencing of thousands of genomes has revealed many common genetic variants, which are the key to unraveling the early evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 and tracking its global spread over time. However, our knowledge of fundamental events in the genome evolution and spread of this coronavirus remains grossly incomplete and highly uncertain. A deep understanding of the contemporary evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed not only for a retrospective on how, when, and why COVID-19 has emerged and spread, but also for creating remedies through efforts of science, technology, medicine, and public policy. Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history, phylogeny, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of tens of thousands of high-quality genomes. The reconstructed mutational progression is highly concordant with the timing of coronavirus sampling dates. It predicts the genome sequence of the progenitor virus whose earliest offspring, without any non-synonymous mutations, were still spreading worldwide months after the report of COVID-19. Over time, mutations of the progenitor gave rise to seven dominant lineages that spread episodically over time, some of which likely arose in Europe and North America after the genesis of the ancestral lineages in China. Mutational barcoding establishes that North American coronaviruses harbor genome signatures different from coronaviruses prevalent in Europe and Asia, which have converged over time. These spatiotemporal patterns continue to evolve as the pandemic progresses and can be viewed live online.",Sudhir Kumar; Qiqing Tao; Steven Weaver; Maxwell D Sanderford; Marcos Caraballo; Sudip Sharma; Sergei L Kosakovsky Pond; Sayaka Miura,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200089,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.311845,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,False
414,Functional genomic screens identify human host factors for SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses,"The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses that causes disease in humans ranging from mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Finding host factors that are common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, we conducted parallel genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E) and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we discovered phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle as well as the potential development of host-directed therapies.",Ruofan Wang; Camille R.

415,A vaccine built from potential immunogenic pieces derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a new global threat demanding a multidisciplinary effort to fight its etiological agent--severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM) harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations.

416,In silico identification and validation of inhibitors of the interaction between neuropilin receptor 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a multifunctional transmembrane receptor for ligands that affect developmental axonal growth and angiogenesis. In addition to a role in cancer, NRP-1 is a reported entry point for several viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The furin cleavage product of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein takes advantage of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) binding site on NRP-1 which accommodates a polybasic stretch ending in a C-terminal arginine. This site has long been a focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer therapeutics. We recently showed that interruption of the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling pathway ameliorates neuropathic pain and hypothesize that interference of this pathway by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interferes with pain signaling. Here, we report hits from a small molecule and natural product screen of nearly 0.5 million compounds targeting the VEGF-A binding site on NRP-1. We identified nine chemical series with lead- or drug-like physico-chemical properties. Using an ELISA, we demonstrate that six compounds disrupt VEGF-A-NRP-1 binding more effectively than EG00229, a known NRP-1 inhibitor. Secondary validation in cells revealed that almost all tested compounds inhibited VEGF-A triggered VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Two compounds displayed robust inhibition of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus protein that utilizes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike for entry and fusion. These compounds represent a first step in a renewed effort to develop small molecule inhibitors of the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling for the treatment of neuropathic pain and cancer with the added potential of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus entry.",Samantha Perez-Miller; Marcel Patek; Aubin Moutal; Carly R Cabel; Curtis A.

417,Cross-reactive serum and memory B cell responses to spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronavirus infection,"Pre-existing immune responses to seasonal endemic coronaviruses could have profound consequences for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, either induced in natural infection or through vaccination. Such consequences are well established in the influenza and flavivirus fields. A first step to establish whether pre-existing responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. We compared serum antibody and memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike (S) proteins from pre-pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using a series of binding and functional assays. We found weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we found stronger evidence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells that were activated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the donors showed varying degrees of cross-reactivity with betacoronaviruses, including SARS and endemic coronaviruses. None of the cross-reactive mAbs were neutralizing except for one that targeted the S2 subunit of the S protein. The results suggest that pre-existing immunity to endemic coronaviruses should be considered in evaluating antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.",Ge Song; Wan-ting He; Sean Callaghan; Fabio Anzanello; Deli Huang; James Ricketts; Jonathan L.

Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 displayed pathological and histological findings consistent with viral pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigens and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the virus from cat 2 revealed that the feline viral genome contained five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence. An analysis of cat 2s viral genome together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared catspecific mutations. These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease.

While the development of specific treatments and a vaccine is urgently needed, functional analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have been limited by the lack of convenient mutagenesis methods. In this study, we established a PCR-based, bacterium-free method to generate SARS-CoV-2 infectious clones. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 could be rescued at high titer with high accuracy after assembling 10 SARS-CoV-2 cDNA fragments by circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) and transfection of the resulting circular genome into susceptible cells. Notably, the construction of infectious clones for reporter viruses and mutant viruses could be completed in two simple steps: introduction of reporter genes or mutations into the desirable DNA fragments (~5,000 base pairs) by PCR and assembly of the DNA fragments by CPER.

420,A proof of concept for neutralizing antibody-guided vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2,"Mutations and transient conformational movements of receptor binding domain (RBD) that make neutralizing epitopes momentarily unavailable, present immune escape routes to SARS-CoV-2. To mitigate viral escape, we developed a cocktail of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting epitopes located on different domains of spike (S) protein. Screening of a library of monoclonal antibodies generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 convalescent patients yielded potent NAbs, targeting N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD domain of S, effective at nM concentrations. Remarkably, combination of RBD-targeting NAbs and NTD-binding NAb, FC05, dramatically enhanced the neutralization potency in cell-based assays and animal model. Results of competitive SPR assays and cryo-EM structures of Fabs bound to S unveil determinants of immunogenicity. Combinations of immunogens, identified in NTD and RBD of S, when immunized in rabbits elicited potent protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. These results provide a proof-of-concept for neutralization-based immunogen design targeting SARS-CoV-2 NTD and RBD.

422,A Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) as a potential tool to prevent collapse of the health care task force during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Introduction: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where overloaded health systems seem inevitable, there is a need for reliable, conceptually adequate, and easily applied measurement tools to identify health professionals at risk. Objective: to present the preliminary psychometric properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) and its association with important outcomes, i.e., moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: The BBES has 4 Likert-type items and was tested as part of a cross-sectional study that included 401 medical students. Reliability analysis and validity studies were performed. Results: In the parallel analysis, two factors were extracted, explaining 84.4% of the variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78, showing high internal consistency.

423,Puerto Rico Health System Resilience After Hurricane Maria: Implications for Disaster Preparedness in the COVID-19 Era,"Background: Every year, Puerto Rico faces a hurricane season fraught with potentially catastrophic structural, emotional and health consequences. In 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria, the largest natural disaster to ever affect the island. Several studies have estimated the excess morbidity and mortality following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, yet no study has comprehensively examined the underlying health system weaknesses contributing to the deleterious health outcomes. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted to assess the ability of the UPR health system to provide patient care in response to Hurricane Maria. An established five key resilience framework and inductive analysis was used to identify factors that affected health system resilience. Thirteen Emergency Medicine Physicians, Family Medicine Physicians, and Hospital Administrators in a University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Community Hospital were interviewed as part of our study. Results: Of the five key resiliency components, three domains were notably weak with respect to UPR resiliency. Prior to the Hurricane, key personnel at the UPR hospital were unaware of the limited capacity of back-up generators at hospitals and were ill-prepared to transfer ICU patients to appropriate hospitals. Post Hurricane, the hospital faced self-regulation challenges when triaging the provision of Hurricane-related emergency services with delivering core health services, in particular for patients with chronic conditions. Finally, during and after the Hurricane, integration of patient care coordination between the UPR hospital ambulances, neighboring hospitals, and national and state government was suboptimal. The two remaining resiliency factors, addressing diverse needs and system adaptiveness in a time of crisis, were seen as strengths. Conclusions: Hurricane Maria exposed weaknesses in the Puerto Rican health system, notably the lack of awareness about the limited capacity of backup generators, poor patient care coordination, and interruption of medical care for patients with chronic conditions. As in other countries, the current COVID epidemic is taxing the capacity of the Puerto Rico health system, which could increase the likelihood of another health system collapse should another hurricane hit the island. Therefore, a resilience framework is a useful tool to help health systems identify areas of improvement in preparation for possible natural disasters.",Christopher Rios; Emilia Ling; Ralph Rivera Gutierrez; Juan Gonzalez; Janine Bruce; Michele Barry; Vinicio de Jesus Perez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20199117,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20198531,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
424,The effect of COVID-19 on the economy: evidence from an early adopter of localized lockdowns,"Background. Governments worldwide have implemented large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing or school closures, to prevent and control the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies, implemented with varying stringency, have imposed substantial social and economic costs to society. As some countries begin to reopen and ease mobility restrictions, lockdowns in smaller geographic areas are increasingly being considered as an attractive policy intervention to mitigate societal costs while controlling epidemic growth. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support these decisions. Methods. Drawing from a rich dataset of localized lockdowns in Chile, we used econometric methods to measure the reduction in local economic activity from lockdowns when applied to smaller or larger geographical areas. We measured economic activity by tax collection at the municipality-level. Findings. Results show lockdowns were associated with a 10-15% drop in local economic activity, a two-fold reduction compared to municipalities not under lockdown. A three-to-four-month lockdown had a similar effect on economic activity than the year of the 2009 great recession. We found that costs are proportional to the population under lockdown, without differences when lockdowns were measured at the municipality or city-wide levels. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that localized lockdowns have a large effect on local economic activity, but these effects are proportional to the population under lockdown. Our results suggest that epidemiological criteria should guide decisions about the optimal size of lockdown areas; the proportional effects of lockdowns on the economy seem to be unchanged by scale.",Kenzo Asahi; Eduardo A Undurraga; Rodrigo Valdes; Rodrigo Wagner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198804,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198887,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
425,Environmental impact of Personal Protective Equipment supplied to health and social care services in England in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objectives Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been central to controlling spread of SARS-CoV2. This study aims to quantify the environmental impact of this, and to model strategies for its reduction. Methods Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE supplied to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use, air freighted, and disposed via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of 1) switching mode of, or eliminating, international travel during supply, 2) reducing glove use 3) using reusable alternatives, 4) maximal recycling. Results The carbon footprint of PPE supplied during the study period totalled 158,838 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields, and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 314 DALYs (disability adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.67 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion costing US $ 20.4 million. Scenario modelling indicated one-third of the carbon footprint could be avoided through switching to shipping, and by 41% through manufacturing PPE in the UK. The carbon footprint was reduced by 83% compared with the base scenario through a combination of UK manufacturing, reducing glove use, using reusable gowns and reuse of face shields, and maximal recycling, estimated to save 259 DALYS, 0.54 species.year, and US $ 15 million due to resource depletion. Conclusions The environmental impact of PPE could be reduced through shipping supplies or domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible, and optimising waste management.",Chantelle Rizan; Malcolm Reed; Mahmood F Bhutta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198804,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198911,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
426,Delayed viral clearance and exacerbated airway hyperinflammation in hypertensive COVID-19 patients,"In COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have emerged as major risk factors for critical disease progression. Concurrently, the impact of the main anti-hypertensive therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), on COVID-19 severity is controversially discussed. By combining clinical data, single-cell sequencing data of airway samples and in vitro experiments, we assessed the cellular and pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 driven by cardiovascular disease and its treatment options. Anti-hypertensive ACEi or ARB therapy, was not associated with an altered expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and thus presumably does not change susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we observed a more critical progress in COVID-19 patients with hypertension associated with a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells. While ACEi treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and intrinsic anti-viral responses, under ARB treatment enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions were observed. Macrophages and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of CCL3, CCL4, and its receptor CCR1, which associated with critical COVID-19 progression. Overall, these results provide a potential explanation for the adverse COVID-19 course in patients with cardiovascular disease, i.e. an augmented immune response in critical cells for the disease course, and might suggest a beneficial effect of clinical ACEi treatment in hypertensive COVID-patients.",Saskia Trump; Soeren Lukassen; Markus S Anker; Robert Lorenz Chua; Johannes Liebig; Loreen Thürmann; Victor M Corman; Marco Binder; Jennifer Loske; Christina Klasa; Teresa Gabriela Krieger; Bianca P Hennig; Marey Messingschlager; Fabian Pott; Julia Kazmierski; Sven Twardziok; Jan Philipp Albrecht; Jürgen Eils; Sara Hadzibegovic; Alessia Lena; Bettina Heidecker; Christine Goffinet; Florian Kurth; Martin Witzenrath; Maria Theresa Völker; Sarah Dorothea Müller; Uwe Gerd Liebert; Naveed Ishaque; Lars Kaderali; Leif Erik Sander; Sven Laudi; Christian Drosten; Roland Eils; Christian Conrad; Ulf Landmesser; Irina Lehmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20198531,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199471,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
427,Epidemiology and precision of SARS-CoV-2 detection following lockdown and relaxation measures,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2-detection is critical for clinical and epidemiological assessment of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. Aim: To cross-validate manual and automated high-throughput (Roche-cobas6800-Target1/Target2) testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, to describe detection rates following lockdown and relaxation, and to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-loads in different specimens. Method: The validation cohort prospectively compared Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas6800-Target1/Target2 in 1344 naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) taken in calendar week 13 using Basel-ORF8-gene-assay for confirmation. Follow-up-cohort-1 and -2 comprised 12363 and 10207 NOPS taken over 10 weeks until calendar week 24 and 34, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-loads were compared in follow-up NOPS, lower respiratory fluids, and plasma. Results: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%) including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman r>0.95; p<0.001) for all assays. Discordant samples (N=36) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2-loads (p<0.001). Following lockdown, weekly detection rates declined to <1% reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% with similarly high SARS-CoV-2-loads, but patients were significantly younger than during lockdown (34 vs 52 years, p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in follow-up NOPS declined by 3log10 copies/mL within 10 days post-diagnosis (p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in NOPS correlated weakly with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids and plasma, but remained detectable in 14 and 7 cases of NOPS with undetectable SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Conclusion: Evaluated manual and automated assays are highly concordant and correlate quantitatively. Following successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require dual-target-assays for clinical and epidemiologic assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be considered within <5 days, using lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.",Karoline Leuzinger; Rainer Gosert; Kirstine Soegaard; Klaudia Naegele; Julia Bielicki; Tim Roloff; Roland Bingisser; Christian Nickel; Nina Khanna; Sarah Tschudin; Andreas Widmer; Katharina Rentsch; Hans Pargger; Martin Siegemund; Daiana Stolz; Michael Tamm; Stefano Bassetti; Michael Osthoff; Manuel Battegay; Adrian Egli; Hans H Hirsch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20198531,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198697,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
428,Dynamic Change of COVID-19 Seroprevalence among Asymptomatic Population in Tokyo during the Second Wave,"Importance: Fatality rates related to COVID-19 in Japan have been low compared to Western Countries and have decreased despite the absence of lockdown. Serological tests monitored across the course of the second wave can provide insights into the population-level prevalence and dynamic patterns of COVID-19 infection. Objective: To assess changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees working in Tokyo during the second wave. Design: We conducted an observational cohort study. Healthy volunteers working for a Japanese company in Tokyo were enrolled from disparate locations to determine seropositivity against COVID19 from May 26 to August 25, 2020. COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined by a rapid COVID19 IgM/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. Across the company, tests were performed and acquired weekly. For each participant, serology tests were offered twice, separated by approximately a month, to provide self-reference of test results and to assess for seroconversion and seroreversion. Setting: Workplace setting within a large company. Participants: Healthy volunteers from 1877 employees of a large Japanese company were recruited to the study from 11 disparate locations across Tokyo. Participants having fever, cough, or shortness of breath at the time of testing were excluded. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Seropositivity rate (SPR) was calculated by pooled data from each two-weeks window across the cohort. Either IgM or IgG positivity was defined as seropositive. Changes in immunological status against SARS-CoV-2 were determined by comparing results between two tests obtained from the same individual. Results: Six hundred fifteen healthy volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0; range 19-69; 45.7 % female) received at least one test. Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over the course of the summer. The most dramatic increase in SPR occurred in late June and early July, paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo, which peaked on August 4. Out of the 350 individuals (mean + SD 42.5 + 10.0; range 19-69; 46.0 % female) who completed both offered tests, 21.4 % of those individuals who tested seronegative became seropositive and seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants. 81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo despite the very low fatality rate. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases that occurred without a shut-down, herd immunity may be implicated. Sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population-level.",Sawako Hibino; Kazutaka Hayashida; Andrew C Ahn; Yasutaka Hayashida,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198887,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198796,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

430,"Heat Stress and PPE during COVID-19: Impact on health care workers' performance, safety and well-being in NHS settings.","Background: The impermeable nature of PPE worn by health care workers (HCWs) during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic can potentiate heat stress which may negatively impact the performance, safety and well-being of HCWs. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate perceived levels of heat stress and its consequences in HCWs required to wear PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method: An anonymous online survey was distributed to HCWs required to wear Type 1 or 2 PPE in NHS settings to evaluate the perceived impact of PPE on: (1) physical and cognitive performance; (2) heat stress and heat-related symptoms; (3) frequency of removing PPE due to discomfort caused by heat stress; and (4) general working-life and well-being. Results: The survey received 224 responses from 192 (85.7%) women and 32 (14.3%) men. Even though 71.9% of respondents wore the less thermally challenging PPE (i.e. Type 2), a median of 3 (IQR: 2,5) heat-related symptoms were reported including syncope (7.7%). A median of 1 (IQR: 0-3) cognitive task was adversely affected with attentional focus being the most affected. To relieve discomfort, 32.6% reported removing PPE on five or more occasions in a shift. Ninety two percent reported PPE made their job more difficult and 76.2% advised that physical performance was impaired. Respondents also highlighted concerns of dermatitis and pressure sores in the facial region (22.3%) amongst other factors. Conclusion: Heat stress experienced when PPE is worn negatively impacts the performance, safety and well-being of HCWs and patients. Therefore, modification to current working practices and current design of PPE is urgently required to improve HCWs resilience to pandemics of infectious diseases. Results suggest modifications to the design of the protective face mask and strict enforcement of specific work/rest ratios to limit the duration of PPE use would be immediate impactful interventions.",Sarah Lee Davey; Ben James Lee; Timothy Robbins; Harpal Randeva; Charles Doug Thake,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198911,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198820,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
431,Efficacy and Safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati in the Management of Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection: An Open Label Feasibility Study,"Background: Guduchi Ghan Vati (aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia) is an essential herbal plant in Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) that is well documented as an immunomodulator and antimicrobial agent. A recent in silico study found the therapeutic efficacy of Guduchi against SARS-CoV-2. Based on available evidence, we conducted a feasibility study of the safety and efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic patients with covid-19. Patients and methods: An open label, feasibility trial was conducted on 46 patients in the hospital setting. A single-arm study with no control group and blinding was executed in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. All patients orally received 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks. Clinical parameters were collected at baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. Patients were continuously monitored for side effects and adverse reactions during the study period. . Results: Out of 46 asymptomatic patients included in the study, 40 completed the 14-day follow-up period. None developed any Covid-19 symptoms after admission to the hospital. On day 3 post-treatment, viral clearance was reported in 16 (32.5%) patients. By the end of D-7, 38 (95%) patients had viral load disappearance. Follow-up at D-14 showed that all participants tested negative. Conclusion: In adult patients with asymptomatic Covid-19, Gudhuchi Ghan Vati could be effective.

So far, insufficient or excessive T cell responses were described in patients. We applied novel approaches to analyze T cell reactivity and showed that T anergy is already present in non-ventilated COVID-19 patients, very pronounced in ventilated patients, strongly associated with virus persistence and reversible with clinical recovery. T cell activation was measured by downstream effects on responder cells like basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils in whole blood and proved to be much more meaningful than classical readouts with PBMCs. Monocytes responded stronger in males than females and IL-2 partially reversed T cell anergy. Downstream markers of T cell anergy were also found in fresh blood samples of critically ill patients with severe T cell anergy.

434,Optimal Dynamic Prioritization of Scarce COVID-19 Vaccines,"Promising COVID-19 vaccines are under rapid development, with initial deployment expected by 2021. Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across socio-demographic groups is a crucial public policy challenge given that (1) vaccine supply will be highly constrained for the first several months of the vaccination campaign (2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from SARS-CoV-2 across groups, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 differs markedly from previous pandemic diseases like influenza. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited vaccine supply in the U.S. across groups differentiated by age and also essential worker status, which constrains opportunities for social distancing. We model transmission dynamics using a compartmental model parameterized to capture current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate trade-offs between three alternative policy objectives: minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths. Moreover, we model a dynamic strategy that responds to changes in the population epidemiological status. Because contacts are concentrated within age groups, there is diminishing marginal returns as vaccination coverage increases in a given group, increasing the group's protective immunity against infection and mortality. We find that optimal prioritization typically targets older essential workers first. However, depending on the policy objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to control spread or seniors to control mortality. When the objective is minimizing deaths, relative to a non-targeted approach, vaccine prioritization averts 15,000 deaths in our baseline model, with a range of 7,000-37,000 across alternative scenarios.",Jack Hoyt Buckner; Gerardo Chowell; Michael R Springborn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198697,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199174,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

This was an observational study with a cross-sectional and time series design based on data from the information system of the State Department of Health of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The microdata from the epidemiological bulletin is open and in the public domain; consultation was carried out from March to July 2020. The incidences were stratified per 100,000 inhabitants. The cross-section study was conducted to describe COVID-19 cases, and the trend analysis was performed using polynomial regression models for time series, with R-Studio software and a significance level of 5%. There was a predominance of women among the cases, and of men in terms of deaths. The presence of comorbidities was statistically related to mortality, particularly lung disease and diabetes, and the mean age of the deaths was 67.7 years. Even though the macro-region of the state capital, Campo Grande, had a higher number of cases, the most fatalities were in the macro-region of Corumba. The trend curve demonstrated discreet growth in the incidence of cases between epidemiological weeks 11 and 19, with a significant increase in week 20 throughout the state. The trend for COVID-19 in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul was upward and regular, but there was an important and alarming exponential increase.

437,A Cost Analysis of Childbirth for Pregnant Women with COVID-19 in the Epicentre of Nigeria,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a major disruptor of health systems globally. Its emergence has warranted the need to reorganize maternity services for childbirth. However, it is not known if this comes at an additional cost to women. We conducted a hospital-based cost analysis to estimate the out-of-pocket cost of spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) and caesarean delivery (CD). Specifically, we collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 who were managed between 1st April and 30th August 2020 at the largest teaching hospital in Lagos, the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria. We compared the mean facility-based costs for the cohort with costs paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying major cost drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. Findings showed that total utilization cost ranged from US$494 (N190,150) for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US$4,553 (N1,751,165) for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32-66% of facility-based cost has been subsidized, cost of SVD and CD have doubled and tripled respectively during the pandemic compared to those paid pre-COVID. Out of the facility-based costs paid, cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) was the major cost driver (50%) for SVD and CD. Supplemental oxygen was a major cost driver when women had severe COVID-19 symptoms and required long admission (48%). Excluding treatment costs specifically for COVID-19, mean facility-based costs for SVD and CD are US$228 (N87,750) and US$948 (N364,551) respectively. Our study demonstrates that despite cost exemptions and donations, utilization costs remain prohibitive. Regulation of the PPE and medical oxygen supply chain can help drive down utilization cost and reduce mark-ups being passed to users.

438,Risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes for people living with HIV: a rapid review and meta-analysis,"Objective: To assess whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality or adverse outcomes, and whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) influences this risk. Design: Rapid review with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Methods: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and Google Scholar up to 26th August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. Results: We identified 1,908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.93, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.59-2.34) compared to people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalised cohorts (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.05-2.24) and studies of PLWH across all settings (HR 2.08, 95%CI: 1.69-2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower-quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF)-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by comorbidities. Conclusion: Evidence is emerging that suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst PLWH. Further investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and CD4+ T cell count, HIV viral load, ART and the use of TDF is warranted.",Maya Mellor; Anne Bast; Nicholas Jones; Nia Roberts; Jose Ordonez-Mena; Alastair Reith; Christopher C Butler; Philippa C Matthews; Jienchi Dorward,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199497,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199661,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

We conducted a cross-sectional study assaying the IgG and IgM antibodies in 1331 individuals with ocular diseases by using a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kit, during the period from February 2020 to May 2020. In our study, the seroposivity in total ocular disease patients was 0.83% (11/1331). The patients with different ocular diseases including xerophthalmia, keratitis, conjunctival cyst, cataract, glaucoma, refractive error, strabismus and others had seroposivity of 2.94%, 12.5%, 25%, 4.41%, 2.63%, 1.6%, 2.22% and 0%, respectively. Among that, two ocular surface disease groups (keratitis and conjunctival cyst) had higher seroprevalence compared with others. All the participants were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction negative for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs. Our study evaluated the seroprevalence in patients with different ocular diseases, which will help us understand the relationship between ocular disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the serological test for the presence of IgM and/or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 might provide accurate estimate of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with ocular diseases.",shengjie li Sr.; yichao qiu; li tang; zhujian wang; wenjun cao; gezhi xu; xinghuai sun,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199497,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198465,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
440,COVID-19 dynamics across the US: A deep learning study of human mobility and social behavior,"This paper presents a deep learning framework for epidemiology system identification from noisy and sparse observations with quantified uncertainty. The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.

442,Challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic for perinatal mental health care: a mixed methods study of mental health care staff,"Purpose: the aim of this study was to explore staff perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health service delivery and outcomes for women who were pregnant or in the first year after birth (perinatal women). Methods: secondary analysis of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Results: staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Conclusions: delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to the needs of women; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions.

There is little evidence regarding the feasibility of universal, asymptomatic testing to help control outbreaks in this population. This study aimed to pilot mass COVID-19 testing on a university research park, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up testing to all staff and students. Methods This was a cross-sectional feasibility study on a university research park in the East of England. All staff and students (5,625) were eligible to participate. All participants were offered 4 PCR swabs, which they self-administered over two weeks. Outcome measures included: uptake; drop-out rate; positivity rates; participant acceptability measures; laboratory processing measures; data collection and management measures. Results 798 (76%) of 1053 who registered provided at least one swab. 687 (86%) provided all four. 792 (99%) of 798 who submitted at least one swab had all negative results. 6 participants had one inconclusive result. There were no positive results. 458 (57%) of 798 participants responded to a post-testing survey, demonstrating a mean acceptability score of 4.51/5, with 5 being the most positive.

444,Early Humoral Response Correlates with Disease Severity and Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, continues to spread globally with significantly high morbidity and mortality rates. Immunological surrogate markers, in particular antigen-specific responses, are of unquestionable value for clinical management of patients with COVID-19. Here, we investigated the kinetics of IgM, IgG against the spike (S) and nucleoproteins (N) proteins and their neutralizing capabilities in hospitalized patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were readily detectable in almost all COVID-19 patients with various clinical presentations. Notably, anti-S and -N IgG, peaked 20-40 day after disease onset, and were still detectable for at least up to 70 days, with nAbs observed during the same time period. Moreover, nAbs titers were strongly correlated with IgG antibodies. Significantly higher levels of nAbs as well as anti-S1 and N IgG and IgM antibodies were found in patients with more severe clinical presentations, patients requiring admission to intensive care units (ICU) or those with fatal outcomes. Interestingly, lower levels of antibodies, particularly anti-N IgG and IgM in the first 15 days after symptoms onset, were found in survivors and those with mild clinical presentations.

447,Empirical transmission advantage of the D614G mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineage carrying the amino acid change D614G has become the dominant variant in the global COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid spread of the G614 mutant suggests that it may have a transmission advantage over the D614 wildtype. Using our previous epidemiological framework to analyze COVID-19 surveillance and sequence data, we estimated that the G614 mutant is 31% (28-34%) more transmissible than the D614 wildtype. As such, interventions that were previously effective in containing or mitigating the D614 wildtype (e.g. in China, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.) might be less effective against the G614 mutant.

450,Smoking is associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 particularly among younger adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Smoking impairs lung immune functions and damages upper airways, increasing risks of contracting and severity of infectious diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies published from January 1-May 25, 2020. We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease, including death. We used a random effects meta-analysis and used meta-regression and lowess regressions to examine relationships in the data. Results: We identified 47 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 31,871 COVID-19 patients, 5,759 (18.1%) experienced disease progression and 5,734 (18.0%) with a history of smoking. Among smokers, 29.2% experienced disease progression, compared with 21.1% of non-smokers. The meta-analysis confirmed an association between smoking and COVID-19 progression (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.32-1.83, p=0.001). Smoking was associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.34, p=0.007). We found no significant difference (p=0.432) between the effects of smoking on COVID-19 disease progression between adjusted and unadjusted analyses, suggesting that smoking is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression. We also found the risk of having COVID-19 progression among younger adults (p=0.023), with the effect most pronounced among people under about 45 years old.

451,"The impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services in governmental health institutions of Dessie town, North-East Ethiopia, 2020 G.C.","Background: The COVID 19 pandemic is causing huge stress on the health care system of all countries in the world. The impact of the pandemic is both social and economic. Pregnancy is an exciting and sometimes stressful experience. Being pregnant during a disease outbreak may add extra anxiety and concern for pregnant women and for those who provide care for them [1, 2]. During the initial stages of the pandemic, it appeared Africa would be spared the burden of COVID-19. However, by April 7th, a total of 45 countries within the WHO African region had reported over 7000 cases (although some place it at over 10 000), with at least 292 deaths and 612 people recovered. Ethiopia, being one of the developing countries trying to address the diverse needs of its people, is currently at the verge of the epidemic [5, 7]. Objectives: The general objective of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services among mothers getting service in governmental health institutions of Dessie town, 2020 G.C. Methods: Institution based cross sectional study design using mixed (quantitative supplemented with qualitative) method was employed to identify the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services among women who get service in governmental health institutions of Dessie town. The study was conducted from July 1-15 / 2020. Result: According to this study, Six percent (6%) of antenatal care attendees, 18% of delivery care attendees and nearly half (46.7%) of postnatal care attendees reported inappropriate service delivery due to fear of health care providers, shortage medical supplies and staff work load. The study also showed that utilization of these services was decreased due to fear of clients to go to health institutions. Conclusion and recommendation: This study concluded that COVID-19 significantly affects the quality and utilization of maternal and reproductive health care services. The study also showed that utilization of these services was decreased due to fear of clients to go to health institutions.

452,Molecular Architecture of Early Disseminationand Massive Second Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in a Major Metropolitan Area,"We sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains causing two COVID-19 disease waves in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston, and an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotypes and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some regions of the spike protein - the primary target of global vaccine efforts - are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR30022. Our study is the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region. The findings will help us to understand the origin, composition, and trajectory of future infection waves, and the potential effect of the host immune response and therapeutic maneuvers on SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

453,Prognostic value of sTREM-1 in COVID-19 patients: a biomarker for disease severity and mortality,"Background: The uncontrolled inflammatory response plays a critical role in the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is thought to be intricate to inflammatory signal amplification. This study aims to investigate the association between soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and COVID-19 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease severity, lethality and clinical management.Methods: We enrolled 91 patients with COVID-19 in domiciliary care (44 patients) or in hospital care (47 patients), who were classified after admission into mild, moderate, severe and critical groups according to their clinical scores. As non-COVID-19 control, 30 healthy volunteers were included. Data on demographic, comorbidities and baseline clinical characteristics were obtained from their medical and nurse records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at admission and after hospitalization outcome to assess cytokine profile and sTREM-1 level by specific immunoassays Results: Within COVID-19 patients, the highest severity was associated with the most significant elevated plasma levels sTREM-1. Using receiver operating curve analysis (ROC), sTREM-1 was found to be predictive of disease severity (AUC= 0.988) and the best cut-off value for predicting in-hospital severity was [&ge;] 116.5 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 93.3% and specificity for 95.8%. We also described the clinical characteristics of these patients and explored the correlation with markers of the disease aggravation. The levels of sTREM-1 were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, blood neutrophils counts, and critical disease scoring (r= 0.68, p<0.0001). On the other hand, sTREM-1 level was significantly negative correlated with lymphocytes counting, and mild disease (r= -0.42, p<0.0001). Higher levels of sTREM-1 were related to poor outcome and death, patients who received dexamethasone tended to have lower sTREM-1 levels. Conclusion: Our results indicated that sTREM-1 in COVID-19 is associated with severe disease development and a prognostic marker for mortality. The use of severity biomarkers such as sTREM-1 together with patients clinical scores could improve the early recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 cases with higher risk of disease worsening.

455,Resuming assisted reproduction services during COVID-19 Pandemic: An Indian experience,"Purpose: The pandemic of COVID-19 has affected many countries and medical services including assisted reproductive treatment (ART) have been hampered. The purpose of the study was to assess the preparedness of ART clinics and staff to resume services and patients reasons to initiate treatment and key performance indicators (KPIs) of ART labs during pandemic. Methods: Semi-descriptive report of two private in-vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics in Maharashtra, India, when COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic people was unavailable. Time required for replenishing laboratory supplies, and staff preparedness to function under new norms of pandemic was documented. Infection mitigation measures at workplace and triaging strategy were evaluated. KPIs of the clinics were evaluated. Results: One-third of the patients consulted through telemedicine accepted or were eligible to initiate treatment upon clinic resumption. Lack of safe transport and financial constraints prevented majority from undergoing IVF, and only 9 percent delayed treatment due to fear of pandemic. With adequate training, staff compliance to meet new demands could be achieved within a week, but supply of consumables was a major constraint. 52 cycles of IVF were performed including fresh cycles and frozen embryo transfers with satisfactory KPIs even during pandemic. Conscious sedation and analgesia during oocyte retrieval was associated with reduced procedure time and no intervention for airway maintenance, compared to general anaesthesia. Self reported pain scores by patients ranged from nil to mild on a graphic rating scale. Conclusion: This study provides a practical insight and will aid in forming guidelines for resumption of IVF services during pandemic.",Padma Rekha Jirge; Sadhana Patwardhan; Dilip Paranjape; Shishir Narendra Jirge; Deepali Atul Bhomkar; Shruti Mahesh Chougule; Anita Salpekar; Deepak Modi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199125,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20198143,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
456,Self-applied ELCSA is valid for rapid tracking of household food insecurity among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Background Rapid household food insecurity (HFI) tracking has been identified as a priority in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. We report the validation of the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (Escala Latinoamericana y Caribena de Seguridad Alimentaria -ELCSA) among pregnant women in Sri Lanka. Methods The adult eight-items of the English version of ELCSA was translated into Sinhala and Tamil. Cognitive testing (on ten pregnant women and five local experts) and psychometric validation of the self-administered HFI tool was conducted among pregnant women (n=269) attending the Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo) special clinics in Anuradhapura in February 2020. We assessed psychometric properties and fit using a one parameter logistic model (Rasch analysis) using STATA version 14 and WINSTEP software version 4.3.4. Concurrent validity was tested using psychological distress. Results The scale was internally consistent (Cronbachs alpha = 0.79), had a good model fit (Rasch infit statistic range: 0.85 to 1.07). Item 8 (did not eat for the whole day) was removed from the model fit analysis as it was not affirmed by anyone. Item severity scores ranged from -2.15 for not eating a diverse diet to 4.43 for not eating during the whole day. Concurrent validity between HFI and psychological distress was confirmed (r=0.15, p<0.05). Conclusions The self-applied version of ELCSA- pregnancy in Sri Lanka (ELCSA-P-SL) is a valid and feasible tool to track HFI among pregnant women in similar contexts during the COVID-19 pandemic, where social distancing is a major concern and its aftermath.",Thilini Chanchala Agampodi; Amber Hromi-Fiedler; Suneth Buddhika Agampodi; Gayani Shashikala Amarasinghe; Nuwan Darshana Wickramasinghe; Imasha U Jayasinghe; Ayesh Umasena Hettiarachchi; Rafael Perez-Escamilla,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199703,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199380,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
457,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fourteen wastewater treatment systems in Uttarakhand and Rajasthan States of North India,"We investigated the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA at different treatment stages of 15 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two North Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Untreated (influent), biologically treated, and disinfected wastewater samples were collected from May to August 2020. The qualitative analysis of the wastewater for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was done using different pre-processing methods. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 11 out of 39 wastewater samples in Jaipur district and 5 out of 17 wastewater samples in Haridwar District using Reverse-Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) for qualitative detection. None of the 56 samples tested for post-secondary or tertiary treatment were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The findings indicate that there are no SARS-CoV-2 related risks involved with using the treated effluent for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater may be a potential route of viral transmission to the WWTP and sanitation workers.

458,"Ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and mortality: an OpenSAFELY analysis of 17 million adults in England","Background: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority populations, both in the UK and internationally. To date, much of the evidence has been derived from studies within single healthcare settings, mainly those hospitalised with COVID-19. Working on behalf of NHS England, the aim of this study was to identify ethnic differences in the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality using a large general population cohort in England. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study using linked primary care records of 17.5 million adults between 1 February 2020 and 3 August 2020. Exposure was self-reported ethnicity collapsed into the 5 and 16 ethnicity categories of the English Census. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify ethnic differences in the risk of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and COVID-19 mortality, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, clinical co-morbidities, geographic region, care home residency, and household size. Results: A total of 17,510,002 adults were included in the study; 63% white (n=11,030,673), 6% south Asian (n=1,034,337), 2% black (n=344,889), 2% other (n=324,730), 1% mixed (n=172,551), and 26% unknown (n=4,602,822). After adjusting for measured explanatory factors, south Asian, black, and mixed groups were marginally more likely to be tested (south Asian HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.07-1.09; black HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.06-1.09, mixed HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and substantially more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.02. 95% CI 1.97-2.07; black HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.61-1.76; mixed HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.36-1.56). The risk of being admitted to ICU for COVID-19 was substantially increased in all ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.22, 95%CI 1.96-2.52; black HR 3.07, 95%CI 2.61-3.61; mixed HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.19-3.75, other HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.31-3.63). Risk of COVID-19 mortality was increased by 25-56% in ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.17-1.38; black HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.38-1.75; mixed HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.12-1.76; other HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.05-1.49). We observed heterogeneity of associations after disaggregation into detailed ethnic groupings; Indian and African groups were at higher risk of all outcomes; Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean groups were less or equally likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, but at higher risk of all other outcomes, Chinese groups were less likely to be tested for and test positive for SARS-CoV-2, more likely to be admitted to ICU, and equally likely to die from COVID-19. Conclusions: We found evidence of substantial ethnic inequalities in the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and mortality, which persisted after accounting for explanatory factors, including household size. It is likely that some of this excess risk is related to factors not captured in clinical records such as occupation, experiences of structural discrimination, or inequitable access to health and social services. Prioritizing linkage between health, social care, and employment data and engaging with ethnic minority communities to better understand their lived experiences is essential for generating evidence to prevent further widening of inequalities in a timely and actionable manner.",Rohini Mathur; Christopher T.

459,Modelling the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through PPE doffing in a hospital environment,"Self-contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a concern for healthcare workers (HCW) following SARS-CoV-2 positive patient care. Staff may subconsciously become contaminated through improper glove removal, so quantifying this risk is critical for safe working procedures. HCW surface contact sequences on a respiratory ward were modelled using a discrete-time Markov chin for: IV-drip care, blood pressure monitoring and doctors' rounds. Accretion of viral RNA on gloves during care was modelled using a stochastic recurrence relation. The HCW then doffed PPE and contaminated themselves in a fraction of cases based on increasing case load. The risk of infection from this exposure was quantified using a dose-response methodology. A parametric study was conducted to analyse the effect of: 1a) increasing patient numbers on the ward, 1b) the proportion of COVID-19 cases, 2) the length of a shift and 3) the probability of touching contaminated PPE. The driving factors for infection risk were surface contamination and number of surface contacts. HCWs on a 100% COVID-19 ward were less than 2-fold more at risk than on a 50% COVID ward (1.6% vs 1%), whilst on a 5% COVID-19 ward, the risk dropped to 0.1% per shift (sd=0.6%). IV-drip care resulted in higher risk than blood pressure monitoring (1.1% vs 1% p<0.0001), whilst doctors' rounds produced a 0.6% risk (sd=0.8%). Recommendations include supervised PPE doffing procedures such as the ""doffing buddy"" scheme, maximising hand hygiene compliance post-doffing and targeted surface cleaning for surfaces away from the patient vicinity.",Marco-Felipe King; Amanda Marie Wilson; Mark H Weir; Martin Lopez-Garcia; Jessica Proctor; Waseem Hiwar; Amirul Khan; Louise A Fletcher; P Andrew Sleigh; Ian Clifton; Stephanie Jane Dancer; Mark H.

462,Downregulation of Defensin genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Defensins, crucial components of the innate immune system, play a vital role against infection as part of frontline immunity. Association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with defensins has not been investigated till date. In this study, we have investigated the expression of defensin genes in the buccal cavity during COVID-19 infection. Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal swab samples collected for screening SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed for the expression of major defensin genes by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, qRT-PCR. 40 SARS-CoV-2 infected positive and 40 negative swab samples were selected for the study. Based on the RT-PCR analysis involving gene specific primer for defensin genes, 10 defensin genes were found to be expressed in the Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal cavity. Six defensin genes were further found to be significantly downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients as against the control, negative samples based on differential expression analysis. The genes significantly downregulated were defensin beta 4A, 4B, 106B, 107B, 103A and defensin alpha 1B. Downregulation of several defensin genes suggests that innate immunity provided by defensins is or may be compromised in SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in progression of the disease caused by the virus. Upregulation of defensin gene expression and use of defensin peptides could be attractive therapeutic interventions.",Mohammed M Idris; Sarena Banu; Archana B Siva; Ramakrishnan Nagaraj,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199380,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20195537,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
463,Putting (Big) Data in Action: Saving Lives with Countrywide Population Movement Monitoring Using Mobile Devices during the COVID-19 Crisis,"Many countries have implemented strict social distancing measures in the hope of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but the effectiveness of these measures is determined by the willingness of populations to comply with restrictions. Consequently, a system of monitoring population movement using existing data sources can inform those making decisions about policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe a collaboration with all 3 major domestic telecommunication companies in Hungary to use aggregated anonymous mobile phone usage data to calculate two indices for assessing the effect of movement restrictions: a ""mobility-index"" and a ""stay-at-home (or resting) index"". The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are compared with the smartphone-based, COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports from Google. Data generated by mobile phones have long been identified as a potential means to analyse mass population movement, but its operationalisation raises several technical questions, such as making sense of Call Detail Records, collation of data from different mobile network providers, and personal data protection concerns. The method described here addresses these issues and offers an effective and inexpensive tool to monitor the impact of social distancing measures, achieving high levels of accuracy and resolution. Especially in populations where uptake of smartphones is modest, this method has certain advantages over app-based solutions, with greater population coverage, but it is not an alternative to smartphone-based solutions used for contact tracing and quarantine monitoring.

466,Validation and clinical evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT),"To understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity after natural infection or vaccination, functional assays such as virus neutralizing assays are needed. So far, assays to determine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies rely on cell-culture based infection assays either using wild type SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viruses. Such assays are labour-intensive, require appropriate biosafety facilities and are difficult to standardize. Recently, a new surrogate virus neutralisation assay (sVNT) was described that uses the principle of an ELISA to measure the neutralization capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of the robustness, specificity and sensitivity on an extensive panel of sera from 269 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 259 unmatched samples collected before 2020 and compared it to cell-based neutralization assays. We found a high specificity of 99.2 (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) and overall sensitivity of 80.3 (95%CI: 74.9-84.8) for the sVNT. Clinical sensitivity increased between early (<14 days post symptom onset or post diagnosis, dpos/dpd) and late sera (>14 dpos/dpd) from 75.0 (64.7-83.2) to 83.1 (76.5-88.1). Also, higher severity was associated with an increase in clinical sensitivity. Upon comparison with cell-based neutralisation assays we determined an analytical sensitivity of 74.3 (56.4-86.9) and 98.2 (89.4-99.9) for titres [&ge;]10 to <40 and [&ge;]40 to <160, respectively. Only samples with a titre [&ge;]160 were always positive in the sVNT. In conclusion, the sVNT can be used as an additional assay to determine the immune status of COVID-19 infected of vaccinated individuals but its value needs to be assessed for the specific context of use.",Benjamin Meyer; Johan Reimerink; Giulia Torriani; Fion Brouwer; Gert-Jan Godeke; Sabine Yerly; Marieke Hoogerwerf; Nicolas Vuilleumier; Laurent Kaiser; Isabella Eckerle; Chantal Reusken,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198754,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20191288,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
467,Analysis of external quality assessment samples revealed crucial performance differences between commercial RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection when taking extraction methods and real-time-PCR instruments into account,"In limelight of the ongoing pandemic SARS-CoV-2 testing is critical for the diagnosis of infected patients, contact-tracing and mitigating the transmission. Diagnostic laboratories are expected to provide appropriate testing with maximum accuracy. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the diagnostic standard yet many commercial diagnostic kits have become available. However, only a handful of studies have reviewed their performance in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the overall analytical matrix including the extraction kit (BD MAX, Promega, Qiagen), the PCR instrument (Agilent Mx3005P, BD MAX, Qiagen Rotor-Gene, Roche Cobas z 480) and the RT-PCR assay (Altona Diagnostics, CerTest Biotec, R-Biopharm AG) using predefined samples from proficiency testing organizers. The greatest difference of the Ct values between the matrices was 9 cycles. One borderline sample could not be detected by 3 out of 12 analytical matrices and yielded a false negative result. We therefore conclude that diagnostic laboratories should take the complete analytical matrix in addition to the performance values published by the manufacturer for a respective RT-PCR kit into account. With limited resources laboratories have to validate a wide range of kits to determine appropriate analytical matrices for detecting SARS-CoV-2 reliably. The interpretation of clinical results has to be adapted accordingly.",Monika Malecki; Jessica Luesebrink; Andreas Wendel; Frauke Mattner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198754,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20185744,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method: All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium (>4500 IU but <175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or >5000 IU but <200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose ([&ge;] 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or [&ge;]200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body-mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis. Results: A total of 152 patients were included; 67 received low, 48 medium, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Mortality was lower in high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%) groups, p{equiv}0.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13 - 0.87) among those who received high dose, respectively 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43 - 1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared with those who received low dose thromboprophylaxis. There were fewer thromboembolic events in the high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%) groups, p{equiv}0.04, but no difference in the proportion of bleeding events, p{equiv}0.16.

470,At home and online during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationship to alcohol consumption in a national sample of U.S. adults,"Objective: The current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Data were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. Results: Twitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. Conclusions: Exposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted.",Karen G Chartier; Jeanine P.D. Guidry; Catherine A.

471,Microfluidic Affinity Profiling reveals a Broad Range of Target Affinities for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Plasma of Covid Survivors,"The clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections can range from asymptomatic to lethal, and is thought to be crucially shaped by the quality of the immune response which includes antibody titres and affinity for their targets. Using Microfluidic Antibody Affinity Profiling (MAAP), we determined the aggregate affinities and concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma samples of 42 seropositive individuals, 23 of whom were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive by PCR testing. We found that dissociation constants (Kd) of anti-RBD antibodies spanned more than two orders of magnitude from 80 pM to 25 nM, despite having similar antibody concentrations. Individual patients showed progressively higher antibody concentrations but constant Kd values, suggesting that affinities did not mature over time. 33 sera showed affinities higher than that of the CoV2 spike for its ACE2 receptor. Accordingly, addition of seropositive plasma to pre-formed spike-ACE2 receptor complexes led to their dissociation. Finally, we observed that the RBD of HKU1, OC43, and SARS-CoV coronaviruses, but not unrelated control proteins, were able to compete substantially with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Therefore, the affinity of total plasma immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of the quality of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and may help select the most efficacious samples for therapeutic plasmapheresis.",Matthias M.

In particular, for the epidemiological problem addressed here, it can be used to compute day by day the contact rate reduction requirement in order to limit the intense care units occupancy to a given threshold. What is more, it could impose a given approaching rate to the health care system limits. Simulations are performed using the well-known SEIR model fitted to the Argentinian case to demonstrate what this control strategy suggests, while the effect of realistic period transitions between different confinement levels are also considered.",Sebastian Nuñez; Fernando A.

475,A simplified approach to monitoring the COVID-19 epidemiologic situation using waste water analysis and its application in Russia,"The number of registered cases of COVID-19 is increasing in the world, and some countries are reporting a second wave of the pandemic. Accurate and real time information about epidemiological situation is therefore urgently needed for managing decisions in the countries, regions and municipalities which are affected. Massive testing of viral presence in human saliva, a smear from the nose, nasopharynx and / or oropharynx, bronchial lavage water obtained by fibrobronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage), as well as from (endo) tracheal, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, biopsy or autopsy material of the lungs, whole blood, serum or antibodies presence in blood cannot give relevant information about the COVID-19 infection rate in the community since simultaneous testing of the whole community is not technically possible, the information obtained in testing of specific groups is retarded and, in addition, such testing is expensive. The alternative to mass testing of the population is the testing of wastewater that could contain SARS-CoV-2 particles originating from excreta. Such testing has several limitations connected with the particularities of the testing procedure. In the present study, a modified approach for detection of COVID-19 infection rate using wastewater analysis has been developed. The approach includes i) the creation of a calibration curve on the basis of the serial dilution of excreta collected from people who are infected with COVID-19 and ii) the analysis of wastewater samples and their serial dilutions but the approach excludes usage of concentration techniques before wastewater sample analysis as well as usage of external control in RT-PCR reactions for calculation of numbers of viral particles. The minimum infection rate that can be detected using this approach is 0.01%. The approach developed was used to investigate wastewater from eleven sewage inspection chambers in the city of Kazan (Russia). It was demonstrated that the average infection rate of people using these sewers was over 0.4% in July 2020.",Polina Kuryntseva; Kamalya Karamova; Valentin Fomin; Svetlana Selivanovskaya; Polina Galitskaya,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20195537,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20197244,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

Despite administrative efforts at mitigation and preventive measures, the large congregation of students within close quarters has caused public health concerns. In this paper, we examine college reopenings' association with changes in human mobility within campuses and in COVID-19 incidence in the counties of the campuses, over a two-week period before and after college reopenings. To estimate the daily reproduction number (Rt), we used a Bayesian framework. Using a difference-in-differences design comparing areas with a college campus, before and after reopening, to areas without a campus, we find that after college reopenings for face-to-face instruction, COVID-19 incidence in the county increased on average by a statistically significant 0.024 per thousand residents, following increases in mobility on campus. Similarly, we estimated increased transmission locally after reopening, with a rising trend in Rt.

477,Short-term Neuropsychiatric Outcomes and Quality of Life in COVID-19 Survivors,"Background: The general medical impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms, and QoL in COVID-19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors followed-up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity, and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. Findings: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Among survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%), and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety were 29.6%, depression (26.8%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (25.1%) respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients, respectively. Delirium and stress-related symptoms increased approximately 4-fold the odds of developing neurocognitive impairment. Female gender and neurocognitive impairment diagnosis were related with an increase of 2.5 and 4.56-fold odds respectively of psychiatric morbidity. Interpretation: Hospitalized COVID-19 survivors showed a high prevalence of neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity, and poor QoL in the short-term.

478,D-dimer dynamics in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: potential utility for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Background: A higher incidence of thrombotic events, mainly pulmonary embolism (PE), has been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objectives: To assess clinical and weekly laboratory differences in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to occurrence of PE. Methods: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset were compared between PE and non-PE patients. Results: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD13.7) vs 69.9 (SD12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1-11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0-2382.2]; p=0.04); 3 (3893.1 [1388.2-6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8-2447.8]; p=0.03); and 4 (2736.3 [1202.1-8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5-2834.6]; p=0.01). Median fold-increase of D-dimer between week 1 and 2 differed between groups (6.64 [3.02-23.05] vs 1.57 [0.64-2.71], p=0.003); ROC curve AUC was 0.879 (p=0.003) with a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 86% and 80%, respectively. Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, D-dimer levels are higher at weeks 2, 3 and 4 after COVID-19 symptom onset in patients who develop PE.

479,The COVID-19 PHARMACOME: Rational Selection of Drug Repurposing Candidates from Multimodal Knowledge Harmonization,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has challenged researchers at a global scale. The scientific communitys massive response has resulted in a flood of experiments, analyses, hypotheses, and publications, especially in the field drug repurposing. However, many of the proposed therapeutic compounds obtained from SARS-CoV-2 specific assays are not in agreement and thus demonstrate the need for a singular source of COVID-19 related information from which a rational selection of drug repurposing candidates can be made. In this paper, we present the COVID-19 PHARMACOME, a comprehensive drug-target-mechanism graph generated from a compilation of several disease maps and experimental data focused on SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pathophysiology. By applying a systematic approach, we were able to predict the effect of drug pairs on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Experimental validation of our results demonstrate that our graph can be used to not only explore the involved mechanistic pathways, but also to identify novel combinations of drug repurposing candidates.",Bruce T Schultz; Andrea Zaliani; Christian Ebeling; Jeanette Reinshagen; Denisa Bojkova; Vanessa Lage-Rupprecht; Reagon Karki; Soeren Lukassen; Yojana Gadiya; Neal Giri Ravindra; Sayoni Das; Shounak Baksi; Daniel Domingo-Fernandez; Manuel Lentzen; Mark Strivens; Tamara Raschka; Jindrich Cinatl Jr.; Lauren Nicole DeLong; Philip Gribbon; Gerd Geisslinger; Sandra Ciesek; David van Dijk Jr.; Steve Gardner; Alpha Tom Kodamullil; Holger Froehlich; Manuel Peitsch; Marc Jacobs; Julia Hoeng; Roland Eils; Carsten Claussen; Martin Hofmann-Apitius,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20196725,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.308239,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,False
480,"Ruling In and Ruling Out COVID-19: Computing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk From Symptoms, Imaging and Test Data.","Background: Assigning meaningful probabilities of SARS CoV2 infection risk presents a diagnostic challenge across the continuum of care. Methods: We integrated patient symptom and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS CoV 2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on thirteen symptoms, estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID 19 compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over 14 days starting in March 2020. Results: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (78%) or cough (77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11) or hospital care (n=44). 51% (n=28) were female, 49% were age <60. Common comorbidities included diabetes (22%), hypertension (27%), cancer (16%) and cardiovascular disease (13%). 69% of these (n=38) were RT-PCR confirmed positive for SARS CoV2 infection, 11 had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS CoV2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6 to 84.2%, specificities of 58.8 to 70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4 to 71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices.

For precise policy making, accurate and efficient forecasts of confirmed cases and death counts are important. In this work, we used five different univariate time series models including; Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Nonparametric Autoregressive (NPAR) and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) models for forecasting confirmed, death and recovered cases. These models were applied to Pakistan COVID-19 data, covering the period from 10, March to 3, July 2020. To evaluate models accuracy, computed two standard mean errors such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The findings show that the time series models are useful in predicting COVID-19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Furthermore, MA model outperformed the rest of all models for confirmed and deaths counts prediction, while ARMA is second best model. The SES model seems superior to other models for prediction of recovered counts, however MA is competitive.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen and IgM/IgG serological RDTs. Methods: Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi-Strip. For IgM/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Theradiag COVID-19 IgM ELISA). Results: Using the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was 87.0% for Cycle Threshold (CT) values [&le;] 25 and 0% for CT values > 25. IgG detection was associated with high CT values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms. The profile of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after the onset of symptoms. The combination of Ag and IgM/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up to 84.0% of COVID-19 confirmed cases at hospital admission.

483,Uncovering clinical risk factors and prediction of severe COVID-19: A machine learning approach based on UK Biobank data,"Background: COVID-19 is a major public health concern. Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with severe disease. Accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is also important clinically. Methods: Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB data), we built machine learning(ML) models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and to evaluate the major risk factors involved. We first restricted the analysis to infected subjects, then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infections as controls. Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. Totally 93 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (e.g. hematological/liver and renal function/metabolic parameters etc.), anthropometric measures and other risk factors (e.g. smoking/drinking habits) were included as predictors. XGboost (gradient boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationship between risk factors and outcomes. Results: A total of 1191 severe and 358 fatal cases were identified. For the analysis among infected individuals (N=1747), our prediction model achieved AUCs of 0.668 and 0.712 for severe and fatal infections respectively. Since only pre-diagnostic clinical data were available, the main objective of this analysis was to identify baseline risk factors. The top five contributing factors for severity were age, waist-hip ratio(WHR), HbA1c, number of drugs taken(cnt_tx) and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. For prediction of mortality, the top features were age, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), urea and WHR. In subsequent analyses involving the whole UKBB population (N for controls=489987), the corresponding AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.669 and 0.749. The same top five risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR and cystatin C. We also uncovered other features of potential relevance, including testosterone, IGF-1 levels, red cell distribution width (RDW) and lymphocyte percentage. Conclusions: We identified a number of baseline clinical risk factors for severe/fatal infection by an ML approach. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multi-comorbidities and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The presented prediction models may be useful at a population level to help identify those susceptible to developing severe/fatal infections, hence facilitating targeted prevention strategies.

We utilized cost-effective, on-demand 3D printing (3DP) technology to produce critical components for a novel ventilator multiplexer system, Vent-Lock, to split one ventilator or anesthesia gas machine between two patients. FloRest, a novel 3DP flow restrictor, provides clinicians control of tidal volumes and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), using the 3DP manometer adaptor to monitor pressures. We tested the ventilator splitter circuit in simulation centers between artificial lungs and used an anesthesia gas machine to successfully ventilate two swines. As one of the first studies to demonstrate splitting one anesthesia gas machine between two swines, we present proof-of-concept of a de novo, closed, multiplexing system, with flow restriction for individualized patient therapy.

485,An improved method to estimate the effective reproduction number of the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from its application in Greece,"Introduction: Monitoring the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt is crucial for assessing the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present an improved method to estimate Rt and its application to routine surveillance data from Greece. Methods: Our method extends that of Cori et al (2013), adding Bayesian imputation of missing symptom onset dates, imputation of infection times using an external estimate of the incubation period, and an adjustment for reporting delay. To facilitate its use, we provide an R software package named ""bayEStim"". We applied the method to COVID-19 surveillance data from Greece, and examined the resulting Rt estimates in relation to control measures applied, in order to assess their effectiveness. We also associated Rt, as a measure of transmissibility, to population mobility as recorded in Google data and to ambient temperature. We used a serial interval between 4 and 7.5 days, and a median incubation period of 5.1 days. Results: In Greece Rt fell rapidly as the first control measures were introduced, dropping below 1 at least a week before a full lockdown came into effect. In mid-July Rt started increasing again, as increased mobility associated with tourism activity was observed. Each 10% of increase in relative mobility increased Rt by 8.1% (95% CrI 6.1-10.2%), whereas each unit celsius of temperature increase decreased Rt by 4.6% (95% CrI 5.4-13.7%). Conclusions: Mobility patterns significantly affect Rt. Most of the reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility in Greece occurred already before the lockdown, likely as a result of decreased population mobility. Lower viral transmissibility in summer does not appear sufficient to counterbalance the increased mobility due to tourism. Monitoring Rt is an essential component of COVID-19 surveillance, and it is crucial for correctly assessing the effect of control measures.",Theodore Lytras; Vana Sypsa; Demosthenes Panagiotakos; Sotirios Tsiodras,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197855,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198028,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
486,Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on theSpread of COVID-19,"This paper studies the interplay between the social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 disease, a widely spread pandemic that has affected nearly most of the world population. Starting in China, the virus has reached the United States of America with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Even though it is not possible to eliminate the spread of the virus from the world or any other country, it might be possible to reduce its effect by decreasing the number of infected people. Implementing such policies needs a good understanding of the system dynamics, generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with complex and continuous feedback loops. As a result, we use agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis through applying some policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, providing good emergency and hospitalization strategies, and preventing traveling would lead to reducing the infection rates. Based on imperial college modeling studies that prove increasing levels of interventions could slow down the spread of disease and infection cases as much as possible, and taking into account that social distancing policy is considered to be the most important factor that was recommended to follow. Our proposed model is designed to test if increasing the social distancing policies strictness can slow down the spread of disease significantly or not, and find out what is the required safe level of social distancing. So, the model was run six times, with six different percentages of social distancing with keeping the other parameters levels fixed for all experiments. The results of our study show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, where the spread of disease and infection rates decrease once social distancing procedures are implemented at higher levels. Also, the behavior space tool was used to run ten experiments with different levels of social distancing, which supported the previous results. We concluded that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels led to significantly reduced infection rates, which result in decreasing deaths. Both types of experiments prove that infection rates are reduced dramatically when the level of social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.",Talal Daghriri; Ozlem Ozmen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197319,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197996,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
487,Analysis of geo-temporal evolution and modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Libya,"Having been experiencing years of political fragmentation and military conflict, Libya was poorly prepared to meet the challenges of the COVId-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, restriction of travel and social distancing rules were put in place days before the first case was detected. During the next two months, the number of cases grew gradually to 77 cases, followed by a rapid spread that has produced 3691 confirmed cases and 80 deaths by the end of July 2020. The turning point on 26 May 2020 was preceded three weeks earlier by the arrival of the first of a series of flights repatriating Libyans who became stranded abroad when air travel was suspended. In the first weeks of the surge, the number of cases was particularly high in the less densely populated southern region, raising questions about the implementation of social distancing and other protective measures in that region. The epidemic in Libya was modeled using the classical Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) mathematical model of infectious disease epidemics. Three scenarios were developed based on three estimates of the fraction of the population exposed to the disease (1.5, 2.5 and 3.5%). The modeling portrays the peak of the epidemic around early August and estimates that the number of deaths will flatten out around early November at between 250 and 600, depending on the parameter employed. More deaths than those estimated implies that is more widespread than assumed. Greater promotion of awareness and understanding of social distancing practices and their value is needed, particularly in the south, and better protection of the elderly should decrease mortality.",Amin Bredan; Hani Benamer; Omran Bakoush,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197319,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197822,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
488,A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India,"Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare five epidemiological models for forecasting and assessing the course of the pandemic. We compare how the models analyze case-recovery-death count data in India, the country with second highest reported case-counts in a world where a large proportion of infections remain undetected. A baseline curve-fitting model is introduced, in addition to three compartmental models: an extended SIR (eSIR) model, an expanded SEIR model developed to account for infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases (SAPHIRE), another SEIR model to handle high false negative rate and symptom-based administration of tests (SEIR-fansy). A semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model developed at the Imperial College London (ICM) is also examined. Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) and mean squared relative prediction error (MSRPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts, SEIR-fansy yields an SMAPE value of 0.72, and the eSIR model yields a value of 33.83. For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 1.76 for baseline model, 23.10 for eSIR, 2.07 for SAPHIRE and 3.20 for SEIR-fansy. For cumulative death counts, the SEIR-fansy model performs the best, with an SMAPE of 7.13, as compared to 26.30 for the eSIR model. Using Pearson correlation coefficient and Lin concordance correlation coefficient, for cumulative case counts, the baseline model exhibits highest correlation (both Pearson as well as Lin coefficients), while for cumulative death counts, projections from SEIR-fansy exhibit the best performance: For cumulative cases, correlation coefficients computed for the baseline model are 1 (Pearson) and 0.991 (Lin). For eSIR, those values are 0.985 (Pearson) and 0.316 (Lin). For SAPHIRE, we compute 1 (Pearson) and 0.975 (Lin). Finally, for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 1 (Pearson) and 0.965 (Lin). Similarly, for cumulative deaths, correlation coefficients computed for eSIR is 0.978 (Pearson) and 0.206 (Lin), and for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 0.999 (Pearson) and 0.742 (Lin). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors on two specific dates (June 30 and July 10) and note that on both dates, the SEIR-fansy model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (June 30: 6.10 and July 10: 6.24) and cumulative deaths (June 30: 3.62 and July 10: 3.99) for both dates, while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (June 30: 27.79 and July 10: 26.74).",Soumik Purkayastha; Rupam Bhattacharyya; Ritwik Bhaduri; Ritoban Kundu; Xuelin Gu; Maxwell Salvatore; Swapnil Mishra; Bhramar Mukherjee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195230,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198010,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True

490,Epidemiology of COVID-19 vs. Influenza: Differential Failure of COVID-19 Mitigation among Hispanics,"BACKGROUND: During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly African-American or Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. We sought to better understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients by comparing individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated the temporal changes in epidemiology across race-ethnicity related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS: We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019-2020 influenza season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020 through May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and, overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9) or obese (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), and to reside in a census tract with [&ge;]40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8).

491,"COVID-19: Risks of Re-emergence, Re-infection, and Control Measures -- A Long Term Modelling Study","In this work we define a modified SEIR model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period, infections from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected individuals, potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions like social confinement. We estimate model parameters in three different scenarios - in Italy, where there is a growing number of cases and re-emergence of the epidemic, in India, where there are significant number of cases post confinement period and in Victoria, Australia where a re-emergence has been controlled with severe social confinement program. Our result shows the benefit of long-term confinement of 50% or above population and extensive testing. With respect to loss of acquired immunity, our model suggests higher impact for Italy. We also show that a reasonably effective vaccine with mass vaccination program can be successful in significantly controlling the size of infected population. We show that for India, a reduction in contact rate by 50% compared to a reduction of 10% in the current stage can reduce death from 0.0268% to 0.0141% of population. Similarly, for Italy we show that reducing contact rate by half can reduce a potential peak infection of 15% population to less than 1.5% of population, and potential deaths from 0.48% to 0.04%. With respect to vaccination, we show that even a 75% efficient vaccine administered to 50% population can reduce the peak number of infected populations by nearly 50% in Italy. Similarly, for India, a 0.056% of population would die without vaccination, while 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 30% population would bring this down to 0.036% of population, and 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 70% population would bring this down to 0.034%.",Subhas Kumar Ghosh; Sachchit Ghosh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198028,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198051,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
492,Age groups that sustain resurging COVID-19 epidemics in the United States,"Following initial declines, in mid 2020, a resurgence in transmission of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has occurred in the United States and parts of Europe. Despite the wide implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, it is still not known how they are impacted by changing contact patterns, age and other demographics. As COVID-19 disease control becomes more localised, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these impacts the loosening of interventions such as school reopening is crucial. Considering dynamics for the United States, we analyse aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. In contrast to previous approaches, we link mobility to mortality via age-specific contact patterns and use this rich relationship to reconstruct accurate transmission dynamics. Contrary to anecdotal evidence, we find little support for age-shifts in contact and transmission dynamics over time. We estimate that, until August, 63.4% [60.9%-65.5%] of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States originated from adults aged 20-49, while 1.2% [0.8%-1.8%] originated from children aged 0- 9. In areas with continued, community-wide transmission, our transmission model predicts that re-opening kindergartens and elementary schools could facilitate spread and lead to additional COVID-19 attributable deaths over a 90-day period. These findings indicate that targeting interventions to adults aged 20-49 are an important consideration in halting resurgent epidemics and preventing COVID-19-attributable deaths when kindergartens and elementary schools reopen.",Mélodie Monod; Alexandra Blenkinsop; Xiaoyue Xi; Daniel Hebert; Sivan Bershan; Valerie C Bradley; Yu Chen; Helen Coupland; Sarah Filippi; Jonathan Ish-Horowicz; Martin McManus; Thomas A Mellan; Axel Gandy; Michael Hutchinson; H Juliette T Unwin; Michaela A.

Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 is its Python interface, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.",Robert Hinch; William J M Probert; Anel Nurtay; Michelle Kendall; Chris Wymatt; Matthew Hall; Katrina Lythgoe; Ana Bulas Cruz; Lele Zhao; Andrea Stewart; Luca Ferritti; Daniel Montero; James Warren; Nicole Mather; Matthew Abueg; Neo Wu; Anthony Finkelstein; David G Bonsall; Lucie Abeler-Dorner; Christophe Fraser,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197996,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195925,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True

495,An automatic pipeline for the design of irreversible derivatives identifies a potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor.,"Designing covalent inhibitors is a task of increasing importance in drug discovery. Efficiently designing irreversible inhibitors, though, remains challenging. Here, we present covalentizer, a computational pipeline for creating irreversible inhibitors based on complex structures of targets with known reversible binders. For each ligand, we create a custom-made focused library of covalent analogs. We use covalent docking, to dock these tailored covalent libraries and to find those that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while keeping some of the main interactions of the original molecule. We found ~11,000 cysteines in close proximity to a ligand across 8,386 protein-ligand complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In prospective evaluation against a panel of kinases, five out of nine predicted covalent inhibitors showed IC50 between 155 nM - 4.2 M. Application of the protocol to an existing SARS-CoV-1 Mpro reversible inhibitor led to a new acrylamide inhibitor series with low micromolar IC50 against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking prediction was validated by 11 co-crystal structures. This is a promising lead series for COVID-19 antivirals.

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were invited to participate in an online survey. which was released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. Findings While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family's health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women's partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. Conclusion This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.

498,COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius: Logistic growth and SEIR modelling with quarantine and an effective reproduction number,"SUMMARY Background and Objectives The island of Mauritius experienced a COVID-19 outbreak from mid-March to end April 2020. The first three cases were reported on March 18 (Day 1) and the last locally transmitted case occurred on April 26 (Day 40). An island confinement was imposed on March 20 followed by a sanitary curfew on March 23. Supermarkets were closed as from March 25 (Day 8). There were a total of 332 cases including 10 deaths from Day 1 to Day 41. Control of the outbreak depended heavily on contact tracing, testing, quarantine measures and the adoption of personal protective measures (PPMs) such as social distancing, the wearing of face masks and personal hygiene by Mauritius inhabitants. Our objectives were to model and understand the evolution of the Mauritius outbreak using mathematical analysis, a logistic growth model and an SEIR compartmental model with quarantine and a reverse sigmoid effective reproduction number and to relate the results to the public health control measures in Mauritius. Methods The daily reported cumulative number of cases in Mauritius were retrieved from the Worldometer website at https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/mauritius/. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model was introduced and analytically integrated under the assumption that the daily incidence of infectious cases evolved as the derivative of the logistic growth function. The cumulative incidence data was fitted using a logistic growth model. The SEIQR model was integrated computationally with an effective reproduction number (R_e) varying in time according to a three-parameter reverse sigmoid model. Results were compared with the retrieved data and the parameters were optimised using the normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) as a comparative statistic. Findings A closed-form analytical solution was obtained for the time-dependence of the cumulative number of cases. For a small final outbreak size, the solution tends to a logistic growth. The cumulative number of cases was well described by the logistic growth model (NRMSE = 0.0276, R^2=0.9945) and by the SEIQR model (NRMSE = 0.0270, R^2=0.9952) with the optimal parameter values. The value of R_e on the day of the reopening of supermarkets (Day 16) was found to be approximately 1.6. Interpretation A mathematical basis has been obtained for using the logistic growth model to describe the time evolution of outbreaks with a small final outbreak size. The evolution of the outbreak in Mauritius was consistent with one modulated by a time-varying effective reproduction number resulting from the epidemic control measures implemented by Mauritius authorities and the PPMs adopted by Mauritius inhabitants. The value of R_e{approx}1.6 on the reopening of supermarkets on Day 16 was sufficient for the outbreak to grow to large-scale proportions in case the Mauritius population did not comply with the PPMs. However, the number of cases remained contained to a small number which is indicative of a significant contribution of the PPMs in the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius.",Antoine Gehin; Smita Goorah; Khemanand Moheeput; Satish Ramchurn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197970,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199364,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
499,Treatment of Moderate to Severe Respiratory COVID-19--A Cost-Utility Analysis,"Background: Due to COVID-19's significant morbidity and mortality, identifying the most cost-effective pharmacologic treatment strategy is critical. As such, we determined the most cost-effective strategy for moderate to severe COVID-19 respiratory infections using the United States health care system as a representative model. Methods: A decision analytic model modelled a base case scenario of a 60-year-old patient admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Patients requiring oxygen were considered moderate severity, and patients with severe COVID-19 required intubation with intensive care. Strategies modelled included giving remdesivir to all patients, remdesivir in severe infections, remdesivir in moderate infections, dexamethasone to all patients, dexamethasone in severe infections, remdesivir in moderate/dexamethasone in severe infections, and best supportive care. Data for the model came from the published literature. The time horizon was 1 year; no discounting was performed due to the short duration. The perspective was of the payer in the United States health care system. Results: Supportive care for moderate/severe COVID-19 cost $11,112.98/0.8256 QALY. Remdesivir in moderate/dexamethasone in severe infections was the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,764.56/QALY gained compared to supportive care. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed remdesivir for moderate/dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 infection was most cost-effective in 88.6% of scenarios and dexamethasone in moderate-severe infections in 11.4% of scenarios. With lower willingness to pay thresholds ($250-$37,500), dexamethasone for severe infections was favoured. Conclusions: Remdesivir for moderate/dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 infections was the most cost-effective strategy.

500,The effect of ABO blood group and antibody class on the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity of clinical outcomes.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 22 million cases and caused immense burdens on governments and healthcare systems worldwide. Since its emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on ways to not only treat the infected but also identify those at risk and prevent spread. There is currently no known biological biomarker that can predict the risk of being infected. A growing set of studies have emerged that show an association between ABO blood group and the risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection as well as susceptibility to a more severe ICU-requiring infection. We found that individuals with blood group B were at a higher risk of infection, while those with blood group AB were at a lower risk. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring COVID-19 infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies present; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). Antibodies were not found to be associated with either risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection. The current study, along with the variation in blood group association results, indicates that blood group may not be the most ideal biomarker to predict risk of COVID-19 infection.",Marwa AlMadhi; Abdulkarim Abdulrahman; Abdulla AlAwadhi; Ali Rabaan; Manaf AlQahtani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20199018,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199422,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
501,Limits and opportunities of SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid Tests: an experience based perspective,"Due to the currently increasing case numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide there is an increasing need for rapid diagnostic devices in addition to existing PCR-capacities. Therefore, rapid antigen assays including lateral flow assays are discussed as an alternative method. In comparison to an established RT-PCR protocol, however the novel lateral flow assay unfortunately lowered the expectations set in these assays.",Jessica Lusebrink; Oliver Schildgen; Verena Schildgen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20199018,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199372,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
502,Reorganization of Substance Use Treatment and Harm Reduction Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Survey,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people with substance use disorders (SUDs) worldwide, and healthcare systems have reorganized their services in response to the pandemic. Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health response is categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service providers, and (4) vulnerable groups. Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business continuity plan, and 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. 57% of overdose prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services also having been negatively impacted. Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm reduction services had been significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we provide a series of recommendations to support countries to be prepared more efficiently for future waves or similar pandemics to 1) help policymakers generate business continuity plans, 2) maintain the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, 3) be prepared for adequate medication supplies, 4) integrate harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities and 5) have specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees.",Seyed Ramin Radfar; Cornelis A J De Jong; Ali Farhoudian; Mohsen Ebrahimi; Parnian Rafei; Mehrnoosh Vahidi; Masud Yunesian; Christos Kouimtsidis; Shalini Arunogiri; Omid Massah; Abbas Deylamizadeh; Kathleen T Brady; Anja Busse; - ISAM-PPIG Global Survey Consortium; Marc N Potenza; Hamed Ekhtiari; Alexander Mario Baldacchino,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198051,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20199133,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
503,Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in non-Italian nationals notified to the Italian surveillance system,"Background International literature suggests that disadvantaged groups are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to poorer living/working conditions and barriers to healthcare access. Yet, to date, there is no evidence of this disproportionate impact on non-national individuals, including economic migrants, short-term travellers, and refugees. Methods We analysed data from the Italian surveillance system of all COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive from the beginning of the outbreak (20th of February) to the 19th of July 2020. We used multilevel negative-binomial regression models to compare the case-fatality rate and the rate of admission to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) between Italian and non-Italian nationals. The analysis was adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and period of diagnosis. Results We analysed 213,180 COVID-19 cases, including 15,974 (7.5%) non-Italian nationals. We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalised [(adjusted relative risk (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.44)] and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower HDI. We also observed an increased risk of death in non-Italian cases from low-HDI countries (ARR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75). Conclusions A delayed diagnosis in non-Italian cases could explain their worse outcomes compared to Italian cases. Ensuring early access to diagnosis and treatment to non-Italians could facilitate the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and improve health outcomes in all people living in Italy, regardless of nationality.",Massimo Fabiani; Alberto Mateo-Urdiales; Xanthi Andrianou; Antonino Bella; Martina Del Manso; Stefania Bellino; Maria C Rota; Stefano Boros; Maria F Vescio; Fortunato P D'Ancona; Andrea Siddu; Ornella Punzo; Antonietta Filia; Silvio Brusaferro; Giovanni Rezza; Maria G Dente; Silvia Declich; Patrizio Pezzotti; Flavia Riccardo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198051,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199398,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
504,Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation and diversity through community wastewater sequencing,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has rapidly become a major global health problem for which public health surveillance is crucial to monitor virus spread. Given the presence of viral RNA in feces in around 40% of infected persons, wastewater-based epidemiology has been proposed as an addition to disease-based surveillance to assess the spread of the virus at the community level. Here we have explored the possibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sewage samples to evaluate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level from routine wastewater testing, and compared these results with the virus diversity in patients from the Netherlands and Belgium. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of viruses belonging to the most prevalent clades (19A, 20A and 20B) in both countries. Clades 19B and 20C were not identified, while they were present in clinical samples during the same period. Low frequency variant (LFV) analysis showed that some known LFVs can be associated with particular clusters within a clade, different to those of their consensus sequences, suggesting the presence of at least 2 clades within a single sewage sample. Additionally, combining genome consensus and LFV analyses we found a total of 57 unique mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which have not been described before. In conclusion, this work illustrates how NGS analysis of wastewater can be used to approximate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in a community.",Ray W.

505,Factors associated with drinking behaviour during COVID-19 social distancing and lockdown among adults in the UK,"Abstract Aim: To assess what factors were associated with reported changes to usual alcohol drinking behaviour during the start of lockdown in the UK. Design: Online cross-sectional survey from 21st March to 4th April 2020. Setting: UK. Participants: 30,375 adults aged [&ge;]18y. Measurements: Changes in drinking over the past week, sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviours, stress about COVID-19, finances or boredom, recent drop in household income, key worker status, and health conditions. Findings: Of 22,113 drinkers (65.7% of analytic sample), 48.1% (95% CI=47.0-49.1%) reported drinking about the same as usual, 25.7% (24.8-26.6%) reported drinking less than usual, and 26.2% (25.4-27.1%) reported drinking more than usual over the past week. Drinking less than usual was independently associated with being younger (OR=0.88 [95% CI=0.83-0.93]), male (OR=0.76 [0.68-0.84]), of an ethnic minority (OR=0.76 [0.61-0.97]), low annual household income (OR=0.74 [0.66-0.83]), having diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 (OR=2.04 [1.72-2.41]), adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviours (OR=1.58 [1.08-2.32]), being significantly stressed about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (OR=1.26 [1.08-1.48]) and not being a key worker (OR=0.87 [0.76-0.99]). Drinking more than usual was independently associated with being younger (OR=0.73 [0.69-0.78]), female (OR=1.36 [1.22-1.51]), post-16 qualifications (OR=1.21 [1.04-1.40]), high annual household income (OR=1.43 [1.27-1.61]), being significantly stressed about catching (OR=1.22 [1.03-1.45]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (OR=1.28 [1.10-1.48]), being significantly stressed about finances (OR=1.43 [1.24-1.66]), and having a diagnosed anxiety disorder (OR=1.24 [1.05-1.46]). Conclusions: In a representative sample of adults in the UK, about half of drinkers reported drinking the same amount of alcohol as usual during the start of the COVID-19 related lockdown, with a quarter drinking more and a quarter drinking less than usual. Drinking more than usual was associated with being younger, female, high socioeconomic position, having an anxiety disorder, and being stressed about finances or COVID-19. These groups may benefit targeted alcohol reduction support if there are further periods of lockdown.",Claire Garnett; Sarah E Jackson; Melissa Oldham; Jamie Brown; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197376,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199430,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
506,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication in an immunocompromised patient,"We describe a case of chronic COVID-19 in a patient with lymphoma and associated B-cell immunodeficiency. Viral cultures and sequence analysis demonstrate ongoing replication of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus for at least 119 days. The patient had three admissions related to COVID-19 over a four-month period and was treated twice with remdesivir and convalescent plasma with resolution of symptoms. The lack of seroconversion and prolonged course illustrate the importance of humoral immunity in resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection. This case highlights challenges in managing immunocompromised hosts, who may act as persistent shedders and sources of transmission.",Ji Hoong Baang; Christopher Smith; Carmen Mirabelli; Andrew L.

507,Aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and infection risk in indoor environments,"The role of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 viruses in airborne transmission of COVID-19 is debated. The transmitting aerosol particles are generated through the breathing and vocalization by infectious subjects. Some authors state that this represents the dominant route of spreading, while others dismiss the option. Public health organizations generally categorize it as a secondary transmission pathway. Here we present a simple, easy-to-use spreadsheet model to estimate the infection risk for different indoor environments, constrained by published data on human aerosol emissions, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, infective dose and other parameters. We evaluate typical indoor settings such as an office, a classroom, a choir practice room and reception/party environments. These are examples, and the reader is invited to use the algorithm for alternative situations and assumptions. Our results suggest that aerosols from highly infective subjects can effectively transmit COVID-19 in indoor environments. This ""highly infective"" category represents approximately twenty percent of the patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We find that ""super infective"" subjects, representing the top five to ten percent of positive-tested ones, plus an unknown fraction of less, but still highly infective, high aerosol-emitting subjects, may cause COVID-19 clusters (>10 infections), e.g. in classrooms, during choir singing and at receptions. The highly infective ones also risk causing such events at parties, for example. In general, active room ventilation and the ubiquitous wearing of face masks (i.e. by all subjects) may reduce the individual infection risk by a factor of five to ten, similar to high-volume HEPA air filtering. The most effective mitigation measure studied is the use of high-quality masks, which can drastically reduce the indoor infection risk through aerosols.",Jos Lelieveld; Frank Helleis; Stephan Borrmann; Yafang Cheng; Frank Drewnick; Gerald Haug; Thomas Klimach; J.

508,"Sharing a household with children and risk of COVID-19: a study of over 300,000 adults living in healthcare worker households in Scotland","Background Children are relatively protected from novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The reasons for this protection are not well understood but differences in the immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been implicated. If such differences are due to differential exposure to non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious agents, adults who are close contacts of children may partly share in this protection. Such a protective effect would have important implications for the lives of children, not least in terms of schooling. Methods Using a Scotland-wide record-linkage based occupational cohort comprising healthcare workers and members of their households, we examined whether sharing a household with young children (aged 0 to 11) attenuated the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19, and/or testing positive for COVID-19 infection of any severity (any case of Covid-19). All healthcare workers directly employed by the National health Service (NHS) in Scotland, or contracted to provide general practice services, were included. Outcome and covariate data were obtained via linkage to Scotland-wide microbiology, drug prescribing, hospitalisation and death data. Results 241,266 adults did not share a household with young children; 41,198, 23,783 and 3,850 shared a household with 1, 2 and 3 or more young children respectively. The risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was lower in those with one child and lower still in those with two or more children, adjusting for age the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.83 per child (95% CI 0.70-0.99). On additionally adjusting for sex, socioeconomic deprivation, occupation, professional role, staff/non-staff status, the number of adults and adolescents in each household, and comorbidity, the HR was 0.89 per child (95% CI 0.74-1.06). An association of the same magnitude, but more precisely estimated, was obtained for any case of COVID-19 (fully adjusted model, HR per child 0.89; 95% CI 0.84-0.95). Conclusion Increased household exposure to young children was associated with an attenuated risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and appeared to also be associated with an attenuated risk of COVID-19 disease severe enough to require hospitalisation.",Rachael Wood; Emma C Thomson; Robert Galbraith; Ciara Gribben; David Caldwell; Jennifer Bishop; Martin Reid; Anoop Shah; Kate Templeton; David Goldberg; Chris Robertson; Sharon Hutchinson; Helen M Colhoun; Paul M McKeigue; David McAllister,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20192245,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20196428,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
509,AI-guided discovery of the invariant host response to viral pandemics,"We sought to define the host immune response, a.k.a, the ""cytokine storm"" that has been implicated in fatal COVID-19 using an AI-based approach. Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a  seed gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. Surprisingly, this 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determines severity/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals were formulated and subsequently validated in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2*ACE2 engagement. IL15/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine tracked with disease severity. Thus, the ViP signatures provide a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the immune response in viral pandemics and may serve as a powerful unbiased tool to rapidly assess disease severity and vet candidate drugs.
