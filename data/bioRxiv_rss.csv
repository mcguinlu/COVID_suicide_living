0,A novel computational approach to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics through the inference of unsampled sources of infection,"Infectious diseases such as the COVID19 pandemic cemented the importance of disease tracking. The role of asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals in driving infection has become evident. Their unaccountability results in ineffective prevention. We developed a pipeline using genomic data to accurately predict a populations transmission network complete with the inference of unsampled sources. The system utilises Bayesian phylogenetics to capture evolutionary and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It identified the effectiveness of preventive measures in Canadas Atlantic bubble and mobile populations such as New York State. Its robustness extends to the prediction of cross-species disease transmission as we inferred SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York City Bronx Zoo. The proposed methods ability to generate such complete transmission networks, provides a more detailed insight into the transmission dynamics within a population. This potential frontline tool will be of direct help in the battle to bend the curve.",Deshan Perera; Ben Perks; Michael Potemkin; Paul Gordon; John Gill; Guido van Marle; Quan Long,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249233,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249233,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
1,Stochastic model for COVID-19 in slums: interaction between biology and public policies,"We present a mathematical model for the simulation of the development of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a slum area under different interventions. Instead of representing interventions as modulations of the parameters of a free running epidemic we introduce a model structure that accounts for the actions but does not assume the results. The disease is modelled in terms of the progression of viremia reported in scientific works. The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62000 cases (about a half of the confirmed by RT-PCR tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the 'asymptomatic' cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and the detection efficiency reaches about 80% of the cases. Requesting two symptoms to trigger intervention can be enough to fail in the goals.",Hernan G. Solari; Mario A.

2,Representative Estimates of COVID-19 Infection Fatality Rates from Three Locations in India,"There are very few estimates of the age-specific infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 in low- and middle-income countries. India reports the second highest number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the world. We estimate age-specific IFR using data from seroprevalence surveys in Mumbai (population 12 million) and Karnataka (population 61 million), and a random sample of economically distressed migrants in Bihar with mortality followup. Among men aged 50-89, IFR is 0.12% in Karnataka (95% C.I. 0.09%-0.15%), 0.53% in Mumbai (0.52%-0.54%), and 5.64% among migrants in Bihar (0-11.16%). IFR in India is approximately twice as high for men as for women, is heterogeneous across contexts, and rises much less at older ages than in comparable studies from high income countries.",Rebecca Cai; Paul Novosad; Vaidehi Tandel; Sam Asher; Anup Malani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249264,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249264,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
3,Prevalence of RT-PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection at schools: First results from the Austrian School-SARS-CoV-2 Study,"Background: There is much debate about the role of schools and children in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We aimed to quantify reliably the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections at schools detected with reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: This nationwide prospective cohort study monitors a representative sample of pupils (grade 1-8) and teachers at Austrian schools throughout the school year 2020/2021. We repeatedly test participants for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a gargling solution and RT-PCR. We herein report on the first two rounds of examinations. We used mixed-effect logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and robust 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Findings: We analysed data on 10734 participants from 245 schools (9465 pupils, 1269 teachers). Prevalence of RT-PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection increased from 0.39% at round 1 (95% CI 0.28-0.55%, 29 September-22 October 2020) to 1.42% at round 2 (95% CI 1.06-1.90%, 10-16 November). Odds ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 2.29 (95% CI 1.26-4.17, P=0.007) in regions with >500 vs. [&le;]500 inhabitants/km2, 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.00, P<0.001) for a two-fold higher regional 7-day incidence, and 2.71 (95% CI 1.68-4.39, P<0.001) in pupils at schools with a high/very high vs. low/moderate social deprivation index. Associations of community incidence and social deprivation persisted in multivariable models. There were no differences between age groups, sexes, pupils vs. teachers, or primary (grade 1-4) vs. secondary schools (grade 5-8). Interpretation: This monitoring study in Austrian schools revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 0.39%-1.42% of participants and identified associations of regional community incidence and social deprivation with higher prevalence.",Peter Willeit; Robert Krause; Bernd Lamprecht; Andrea Berghold; Buck Hanson; Evelyn Stelzl; Heribert Stoiber; Johannes Zuber; Robert Heinen; Alwin Koehler; David Bernhard; Wegene Borena; Christian Doppler; Dorothee von Laer; Hannes Schmidt; Johannes Proell; Ivo Steinmetz; Michael Wagner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20248952,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20248952,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
4,"Viral Variants and Vaccinations: If We Can Change the COVID-19 Vaccine, Should We?","As we close in on one year since the COVID-19 pandemic began, hope has been placed on bringing the virus under control through mass administration of recently developed vaccines. Unfortunately, newly emerged, fast-spreading strains of COVID-19 threaten to undermine progress by interfering with vaccine efficacy. While a long-term solution to this challenge would be to develop vaccines that simultaneously target multiple different COVID-19 variants, this approach faces both developmental and regulatory hurdles. A simpler option would be to switch the target of the current vaccine to better match the newest viral variant. I use a stochastic simulation to determine when it is better to target a newly emerged viral variant and when it is better to target the dominant but potentially less transmissible strain. My simulation results suggest that it is almost always better to target the faster spreading strain, even when the initial prevalence of this variant is much lower. In scenarios where targeting the slower spreading variant is best, all vaccination strategies perform relatively well, meaning that the choice of vaccination strategy has a small effect on public health outcomes. In scenarios where targeting the faster spreading variant is best, use of vaccines against the faster spreading viral variant can save many lives. My results provide rule of thumb guidance for those making critical decisions about vaccine formulation over the coming months.",Sharon Bewick,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249255,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249255,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
5,Associations between Stress and Child Verbal Abuse and Corporal Punishment during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Potential Effect Modification by Lockdown Measures,"Background: Child abuse appears to be on the increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent that lockdown measures modified the association between stress and abuses has not been systematically assessed. Objectives: To assess: 1) the association between caregiver's stress and self-reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment of a child in the household, and; 2) modification of the stated association by experienced COVID-19 lockdown measures. Participants and settings: Caregivers residing in villages on lockdown in the Deep South of Thailand (n=466 participants) Methods: We randomly sampled 12 villages in the study area, and 40 households per village. Trained enumerators who were residents of the sampled villages collected the data using phone-based interview. We measured stress level using the standard ST-5 questionnaire. We developed and pilot-tested questions for measurement of child abuse and lockdown experiences specifically for this study. Results: Caregivers with moderate and higher levels of stress were more likely than caregivers with low level of stress to report verbal abuse (48% vs. 23%, respectively; Adj. OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.89, 5.15) and corporal punishment (28% vs. 8%, respectively; Adj. OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.41, 5.42). We found that COVID-19 lockdown experiences modified the associations between stress and verbal abuse and corporal punishment. Conclusion: There were associations between stress and abuses, which were modified by lockdown experiences. However, social desirability, lack of details in the answers, and potential confounding by mental illness co-morbidities were notable limitations of the study. Caveat is advised in the interpretation of the study findings.",Rohani Jeharsae; Manusameen Jae-noh; Haneefah Jae-a-lee; Suhaida Waeteh; Nisuraida Nimu; Corliyoh Chewae; Malinee Yama; Nurin Dureh; Wit Wichaidit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20248973,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20248973,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
6,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the urban population of Qatar: An analysis of antibody testing on a sample of 112,941 individuals","BackgroundQatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our first objective was to assess the proportion of the urban population that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, by measuring the prevalence of detectable antibodies. Our second objective was to identify predictors for infection and for having higher antibody titers.

MethodsResidual blood specimens from individuals receiving routine and other clinical care between May 12-September 9, 2020 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Associations with seropositivity and higher antibody titers were identified through regression analyses. Probability weights were applied in deriving the epidemiological measures.

ResultsWe tested 112,941 individuals ([~]10% of Qatars urban population), of whom 51.6% were men and 66.0% were 20-49 years of age. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%) and was significantly associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. The proportion with higher antibody titers varied by age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. There was a strong correlation between higher antibody titers and seroprevalence in each nationality, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), suggesting that higher antibody titers may indicate repeated exposure to the virus. The percentage of antibody-positive persons with prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was 47.1% (95% CI: 46.1-48.2%), severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4%), and fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%).

ConclusionsFewer than two in every 10 individuals in Qatars urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between May 12-September 9, 2020, suggesting that this population is still far from the herd immunity threshold and at risk from a subsequent epidemic wave.",Peter V.

7,Machine Learning Forecast of Growth in COVID-19 Confirmed Infection Cases with Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and Cultural Dimensions: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Background: National governments have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions to control and mitigate against the COVID-19 pandemic. A deep understanding of these interventions is required. Objective: We investigate the prediction of future daily national Confirmed Infection Growths - the percentage change in total cumulative cases across 14 days - using metrics representative of non-pharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions of each country. Methods: We combine the OxCGRT dataset, Hofstede's cultural dimensions, and COVID-19 daily reported infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non-time series machine learning models in predicting Confirmed Infection Growth. We use three validation methods - in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation - for evaluation, each applicable to a different use case of the models. Results: Our results demonstrate high R^2 values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation methods (0.959, 0.513, and 0.574 respectively) using random forest and AdaBoost regression. While these models may be used to predict the Confirmed Infection Growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case. Conclusions: This work provides new considerations in using machine learning techniques with non-pharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions data for predicting the national growth of confirmed infections of COVID-19.",Arnold YS Yeung; Francois Roewer-Despres; Laura Rosella; Frank Rudzicz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249235,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249235,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
8,Genomic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Zimbabwe: Role of international travel and regional migration in spread,"Zimbabwe reported its first case of SARS-Cov-2 infection in March 2020, and case numbers increased to more than 8,099 to 16th October 2020. An understanding of the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak in Zimbabwe will assist in the implementation of effective public health interventions to control transmission. Nasopharyngeal samples from 92,299 suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Zimbabwe between 20 March and 16 October 2020 were obtained. Available demographic data associated with those cases identified as positive (8,099) were analysed to describe the national breakdown of positive cases over time in more detail (geographical location, sex, age and travel history). The whole genome sequence (WGS) of one hundred SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from the first 120 days of the epidemic in Zimbabwe was determined to identify their relationship to one another and WGS from global samples. Overall, a greater proportion of infections were in males (55.5%) than females (44.85%), although in older age groups more females were affected than males. Most COVID-19 cases (57 %) were in the 20-40 age group. Eight lineages, from at least 25 separate introductions into the region were found using comparative genomics. Of these, 95% had the D614G mutation on the spike protein which was associated with higher transmissibility than the ancestral strain. Early introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly associated with genomes common in Europe and the United States of America (USA), and few common in Asia at this time. As the pandemic evolved, travel-associated cases from South Africa and other neighbouring countries were also recorded. Transmission within quarantine centres occurred when travelling nationals returning to Zimbabwe. International and regional migration followed by local transmission were identified as accounting for the development of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Zimbabwe. Based on this, rapid implementation of public health interventions are critical to reduce local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Impact of the predominant G614 strain on severity of symptoms in COVID-19 cases needs further investigation.",Tapfumanei Mashe; Faustinos Tatenda Takawira; Leonardo de Oliveira Martins; Muchaneta Gudza-Mugabe; Joconiah Chirenda; Manes Munyanyi; Hlanai Gumbo; Blessmore V Chaibva; Charles Nyagupe; Andrew Tarupiwa; Agnes Juru; Isaac Phiri; Portia Manangazira; Alexander Goredema; Sydney Danda; Israel Chabata; Janet Jonga; Rutendo Munharira; Kudzai Masunda; Innocent Mukeredzi; Douglas Mangwanya; - The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium; - SARS-CoV-2 Research Group; Alex Trotter; Thanh Le Viet; Gemma Kay; David Baker; Gaetan Thilliez; Ana-Victoria Gutierrez; Justin O Grady; Maxwell Hove; Sekesai Mutapuri-Zinyowera; Andrew J.

9,Twitter Discourse on Nicotine as Potential Prophylactic or Therapeutic for COVID-19,"Objective: The low observed prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in certain cohorts has led to a hypothesis regarding nicotine's therapeutic role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them. Methods: We used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets. Results: 21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping. Conclusion: The social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation. This calls for circumspection and additional planning in countering such narratives as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our world.",Ramakanth Kavuluru; Jiho Noh; Shyanika W Rose,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249284,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249284,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
10,Prevalence and Factors associated with Mental health impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A survey-based cross-sectional study,"Abstract Background: Feelings of isolation, insecurity, and instability triggered by COVID 19 could have a long-term impact on the mental health status of individuals. This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with the mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID 19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods: From 1st to 30th April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms while, the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self quarantined in the previous 7 days before the survey and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% experienced depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and levels of stress, respectively. In Bangladesh, there is a need for better mental health support for females especially those that lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division and experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat during COVID 19 and other future pandemics.",Dr. Tanvir Abir; Dr. Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah; Dr. L Osuagwu Uchechukwu; Dewan Muhammad Nur -A Yazdani; Taha Husain; Piwuna Christopher Goson; Palash Basak; Md Adnan Rahman; Dr. Abdullah Al Mamun; Dr. P.

11,Saliva viral load is a dynamic unifying correlate of COVID-19 severity and mortality,"While several clinical and immunological parameters correlate with disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains in identifying unifying correlates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used to guide clinical practice. Here, we examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels. Together these results demonstrated that viral load, as measured by saliva but not nasopharyngeal, is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and mortality over time.",Julio Silva; Carolina Lucas; Maria Sundaram; Benjamin Israelow; Patrick Wong; Jon Klein; Maria Tokuyama; Peiwen Lu; Arvind Venkataraman; Feimei Liu; Tianyang Mao; Ji Eun Oh; Annsea Park; arnau Casanovas-Massana; Chantal B.F.

12,Long term impact on lung function of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. A prospective cohort study,"Introduction A significant number of patients continue to recover from COVID-19; however, little is known about the lung function capacity among survivors. We aim to determine the long-term impact on lung function capacity in patients who have survived moderate or severe COVID-19 disease in a resource-poor setting. Methods and analysis This prospective cohort study will include patients aged 15 years and above and have reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for COVID 19 (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal). Patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of obstructive or interstitial lung disease, lung fibrosis and cancers, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune conditions affecting the lungs, underlying heart disease, history of syncope and refuse to participate will be excluded. Pulmonary function will be assessed using spirometry and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) at three- and six-months interval. A chest X-ray at three and six-month follow-up and CT-chest will be performed if clinically indicated after consultation with the study pulmonologist or Infectious Disease (ID) physician. Echocardiogram (ECHO) to look for pulmonary hypertension at the three months visit and repeated at six months if any abnormality is identified initially. Data analysis will be performed using standard statistical software. Ethics and dissemination The proposal was reviewed and approved by ethics review committee (ERC) of the institution (ERC reference number 2020-4735-11311).

13,THE INTESTINAL AND ORAL MICROBIOMES ARE ROBUST PREDICTORS OF COVID-19 SEVERITY THE MAIN PREDICTOR OF COVID-19-RELATED FATALITY,"The reason for the striking differences in clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is still poorly understood. While most recover, a subset of people become critically ill and succumb to the disease. Thus, identification of biomarkers that can predict the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 disease is key to help prioritize patients needing urgent treatment. Given that an unbalanced gut microbiome is a reflection of poor health, we aim to identify indicator species that could predict COVID-19 disease clinical outcomes. Here, for the first time and with the largest COVID-19 patient cohort reported for microbiome studies, we demonstrated that the intestinal and oral microbiome make-up predicts respectively with 92% and 84% accuracy (Area Under the Curve or AUC) severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms that lead to death. The accuracy of the microbiome prediction of COVID-19 severity was found to be far superior to that from training similar models using information from comorbidities often adopted to triage patients in the clinic (77% AUC). Additionally, by combining symptoms, comorbidities, and the intestinal microbiota the model reached the highest AUC at 96%. Remarkably the model training on the stool microbiome found enrichment of Enterococcus faecalis, a known pathobiont, as the top predictor of COVID-19 disease severity. Enterococcus faecalis is already easily cultivable in clinical laboratories, as such we urge the medical community to include this bacterium as a robust predictor of COVID-19 severity when assessing risk stratification of patients in the clinic.",Doyle V Ward; Shakti Bhattarai; Mayra Rojas-Correa; Ayan Purkayastha; Devon Holler; Ming Da Qu; William G Mitchell; Jason Yang; Samuel Fountain; Abigail Zeamer; Catherine Forconi; Gavin Fujimori; Boaz Odwar; Caitlin Cawley; Beth A McCormick; Ann Moormann; Mireya Wessolossky; Vanni Bucci; Ana Maldonado-Contreras,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249061,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
14,"Fever, Diarrhea, and Severe Disease Correlate with High Persistent Antibody Levels against SARS-CoV-2","Lasting immunity will be critical for overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, factors that drive the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear. Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79).

15,Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid tests at elevated temperatures,"Rapid antigen-detecting tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 5-30{degrees}C. In many countries that would benefit from SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, mean temperatures exceed 30{degrees}C. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including (i) long-term storage and testing at recommended conditions, (ii) recommended storage conditions followed by 10 minutes exposure to 37{degrees}C and testing at 37{degrees}C and (iii) 3 weeks storage followed by testing at 37{degrees}C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 8.2x105-7.9x107 genome copies/ml of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 minutes pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37{degrees}C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for 46% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37{degrees}C, 73% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture-derived human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 was not affected by storage and testing at 37{degrees}C. In summary, short- and long-term exposure to elevated temperatures likely impairs sensitivity of several SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that may translate to false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with inter-individual transmission. Ensuring appropriate transport and storage conditions, and development of tests that are more robust across temperature fluctuations will be important for accurate use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs in tropical settings.",Verena Claudia Haage; Edmilson Ferreira de Oliveira-Filho; Andres Moreira-Soto; Arne Kühne; Carlo Fischer; Jilian Sacks; Victor Max Corman; Marcel A.

16,Ivermectin shows clinical benefits in mild to moderate Covid19 disease: A randomised controlled double blind dose response study in Lagos.,"Introduction: In vitro studies have shown the efficacy of Ivermectin (IV) to inhibit the SARS - CoV- 2 viral replication, but questions remained as to In-vivo applications. We set out to explore the efficacy and safety of Ivermectin in persons infected with COVID19. Methods: We conducted a translational proof of concept (PoC) randomized, double blind placebo controlled, dose response, parallel group study of IV efficacy in RT - PCR proven COVID 19 positive patients. 62 patients were randomized to 3 treatment groups. (A) IV 6mg regime, (B)IV 12 mg regime (given Q84hrs for 2weeks) (C, control) Lopinavir/Ritonavir. All groups plus standard of Care. Results: The Days to COVID negativity [DTN] was significantly and dose dependently reduced by IV (p = 0.0066). The DTN for Control were, = 9.1+/-5.2, for A 6.0 +/- 2.9, and for B 4.6 +/-3.2 . 2 Way repeated measures ANOVA of ranked COVID 19 + / - scores at 0, 84, 168, 232 hours showed a significant IV treatment effect (p=0.035) and time effect (p <0.0001). IV also tended to increase SPO2 % compared to controls, p = 0.073, 95% CI - 0.39 to 2.59 and increased platelet count compared to C (p = 0.037) 95%CI 5.55 - 162.55 multiplied by 10^3/ml. The platelet count increase was inversely correlated to DTN (r = -0.52, p = 0.005). No SAE was reported. Conclusions: 12 mg IV regime may have superior efficacy. IV should be considered for use in clinical management of SARS-Cov-2, and may find applications in community prophylaxis in high-risk areas.

17,Modelling Decay of Population Immunity With Proposed Second Dose Deferral Strategy,"A second dose deferred strategy has been proposed to increase initial population immunity as an alternative to the default two dose vaccine regimen with spacing of 21 or 28 days between vaccine doses for the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. This increased initial population immunity is only of value if one dose immunity does not decay so fast as to nullify the benefit. Because decay rates of one dose and two dose efficacy are currently unknown, a model to project population immunity between the two strategies was created. By evaluating the decay rate of one dose efficacy, two dose efficacy, and time until the second dose is given, the model shows that if there is an increased decay rate of one dose efficacy relative to two dose decay rates, it is highly unlikely to nullify the benefit of increased population immunity seen in a second dose deferral strategy. Rather, all reasonable scenarios strongly favour a second dose deferral strategy with much higher projected population immunity in comparison to the default regimen.",Graham T Jurgens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249293,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249293,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
18,Adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in recovered severe COVID-19 patients,"Objectives: There is an imperative need to determine the durability of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting S1 and M proteins and measured RBD-specific serum IgG over a period of 2-6 months after symptoms onset in a cohort of subjects who had recovered from severe clinical forms of COVID-19. Methods: We recruited 58 patients (38 males and 20 females; median age, 62.5 years), who had been hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia, 60% with one or more comorbidities. IgG antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were measured by ELISA. SARSCoV-2-reactive CD69+ -expressing-IFN{gamma}-producing-CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were enumerated in heparinized whole blood by flow cytometry for ICS. Results: Detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M-reactive CD69+ -IFN-{gamma} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were displayed in 17 (29.3%) and 6 (10.3%) subjects respectively, at a median of 84 days after onset of symptoms (range, 58-191 days). Concurrent comorbidities increased the risk (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.03-9.61; P=0.04) of undetectable T-cell responses in models adjusted for age, sex and hospitalization ward. Twenty-one out of the 35 patients (60%) had detectable RBD-specific serum IgGs at a median of 118 days (range, 60 to 145 days) after symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific IgG serum levels were found to drop significantly over time. Conclusion: A relatively limited number of subjects who developed severe forms of COVID-19 had detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M IFN{gamma} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at midterm after clinical diagnosis. Our data also indicated that serum levels of RBD specific IgGs decline over time, becoming undetectable in some patients.",Beatriz Olea; Eliseo Albert Vicent Sr.; Ignacio Torres Sr.; Paula Amat; Maria Jose Remigia; Roberto Gozalbo Sr.; Jesus Rodriguez Sr.; Javier Buesa Sr.; Maria Luisa Blasco Sr.; Josep Redon Sr.; Jaime Signes Sr.; David Navarro Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249027,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249027,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
19,"Human cell-dependent, directional, time-dependent changes in the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes","Background: When a virus that has grown in a nonhuman host starts an epidemic in the human population, human cells may not provide growth conditions ideal for the virus. Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment. Results: Time-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long period and away from those of bat coronaviruses. Conclusions: Clade-independent, time-dependent changes are thought to have biological significance and should relate to viral adaptation to a new host environment, providing important clues for understanding viral host adaptation mechanisms.",Yuki Iwasaki; Takashi Abe; Toshimichi Ikemura,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425508,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425508,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False

Our results indicate that virtual patients with low production rates of infected cell derived IFN subsequently experienced highly inflammatory disease phenotypes, compared to those with early and robust IFN responses. In these in silico patients, the maximum concentration of IL-6 was also a major predictor of CD8+ T cell depletion. Our analyses predicted that individuals with severe COVID-19 also have accelerated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation that was mediated by increased IL-6 and reduced type I IFN signalling. Together, these findings identify biomarkers driving the development of severe COVID-19 and support early interventions aimed at reducing inflammation.",Adrianne L. Jenner; Rosemary A.

21,RNA-protein interaction analysis of SARS-CoV-2 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions identifies an antiviral role of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-strand RNA virus. Viral genome is capped at the 5'-end, followed by an untranslated region (UTR). There is poly-A tail at 3'-end, preceded by an UTR. Self-interaction between the RNA regulatory elements present within 5'- and 3'-UTRs as well as their interaction with host/virus-encoded proteins mediate the function of 5'- and 3'-UTRs. Using RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID) assay coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometry, we identified host interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 5'- and 3'-UTRs and generated an RNA-protein interaction network. By combining these data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data proposed to be involved in virus replication, we generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network, likely to be essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, bioinformatics analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism. Lysosome-associated membrane protein-2a (Lamp2a) was one of the host proteins that interact with the 5'-UTR. Further studies showed that Lamp2 level is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and overexpression of Lamp2a and Lamp2b variants reduced viral RNA level in infected cells and vice versa. In summary, our study provides an useful resource of SARS-CoV-2 5'- and 3'-UTR binding proteins and reveal the antiviral function of host Lamp2 protein.",Rohit Verma; Sandhini Saha; Shiv Kumar; Shailendra Mani; Tushar Kanti Maiti; Milan Surjit,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425516,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425516,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False
22,Protein scaffold-based multimerization of soluble ACE2 efficiently blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) decoy receptors are promising agents to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as they are not affected by common escape mutations in viral proteins. However, their success may be limited by their relatively poor potency. To address these challenges, we developed a highly active multimeric sACE2 decoy receptor via a SunTag system that could neutralize both pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates. This fusion protein demonstrated a neutralization efficiency nearly 250-fold greater than monomeric sACE2. SunTag in combination with a more potent version of sACE2 achieved near complete neutralization at a sub-nanomolar range, which is comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that this activity is due to greater occupancy of the multimeric decoy receptors on Spike protein as compared to monomeric sACE2. Overall, these highly potent multimeric sACE2 decoy receptors offer a promising treatment approach against SARS-CoV-2 infections including its novel variants.",Alisan Kayabolen; Ugur Akcan; Dogancan Ozturan; Ehsan Sarayloo; Elif Nurtop; Berna Ozer; Gizem Nur Sahin; Ozlem Dogan; Nathan Lack; Mehmet Kaya; Cem Albayrak; Fusun Can; Ihsan Solaroglu; Tugba Bagci-Onder,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425128,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425128,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False
23,Chitinase 3-like-1 is a Therapeutic Target That Mediates the Effects of Aging in COVID-19,"COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus and is more prevalent and severe in the elderly and patients with comorbid diseases (CM). Because chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is induced during aging and CM, the relationships between CHI3L1 and SC2 were investigated. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of the SC2 receptor ACE2 and viral spike protein priming proteases (SPP), that ACE2 and SPP are induced during aging and that anti-CHI3L1, kasugamycin and inhibitors of phosphorylation, abrogate these ACE2- and SPP- inductive events. Human studies also demonstrated that the levels of circulating CHI3L1 are increased in the elderly and patients with CM where they correlate with COVID-19 severity. These studies demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of ACE2 and SPP; that this induction is a major mechanism contributing to the effects of aging during SC2 infection and that CHI3L1 coopts the CHI3L1 axis to augment SC2 infection. CHI3L1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of and is an attractive therapeutic target in COVID-19.",Suchitra Kamle; Bing Ma; Chuan Hua He; Bedia Akosman; Yang Zhou; Chang-Min Lee; Wafik S.

24,"SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro evolution follows contagious mutation spread, yet generates an able infection inhibitor","SARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, with more contagious mutations spreading rapidly. Using in vitro evolution to affinity maturate the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein towards ACE2, resulted in the more contagious mutations, S477N, E484K, and N501Y to be among the first selected. This includes the British and South-African variants. Plotting the binding affinity to ACE2 of selected RBD mutations against their incidence in the population shows a strong correlation between the two. Further in vitro evolution enhancing binding by 600-fold provides guidelines towards potentially new evolving mutations with even higher infectivity. Yet, the high-affinity RBD is also an efficient drug, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.

25,Role of spatial patterning of N-protein interactions in SARS-CoV-2 genome packaging,"Viruses must efficiently and specifically package their genomes while excluding cellular nucleic acids and viral sub-genomic fragments. Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome compaction and cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Single genome packaging is possible for diverse arrangements of LLPS-promoting sequences in the genome, but only in limited conditions at the edge of the phase boundary. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined order.",Ian Seim; Christine Roden; Amy Gladfelter,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425605,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425605,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False

27,SARS-CoV-2 spike downregulates tetherin to enhance viral spread,"The antiviral restriction factor, tetherin, blocks the release of several different families of enveloped viruses, including the Coronaviridae. Tetherin is an interferon-induced protein that forms parallel homodimers between the host cell and viral particles, linking viruses to the surface of infected cells and inhibiting their release. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 downregulates tetherin to aid its release from cells, and investigate potential proteins involved in this process. Loss of tetherin from cells caused an increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral titre. We find SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to be responsible for tetherin downregulation, rather than ORF7a as previously described for the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV. We instead find ORF7a to be responsible for Golgi fragmentation, and expression of ORF7a in cells recapitulates Golgi fragmentation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.",Hazel Stewart; Kristoffer H Johansen; Naomi McGovern; Roberta Palmulli; George W Carnell; Jonathan Luke Heeney; Klaus Okkenhaug; Andrew Firth; Andrew A Peden; James R Edgar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425396,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425396,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False
28,Self-organized stem cell-derived human lung buds with proximo-distal patterning and novel targets of SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of therapeutics hinders pandemic control1-2. Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients1-3, how SARS-CoV-2 induces tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned substrates. Strikingly, in vitro-derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo-like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF. Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNThi cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type4. These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission. Our platform offers unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks of human lung development and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.",Edwin A Rosado-Olivieri; Brandon Razooky; Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann; Riccardo De Santis; Charles M Rice; Ali H Brivanlou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425622,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425622,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False

Here we first analyzed 4,013 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different continents over a 14-week timespan since the outbreak in Wuhan, China. 2,954 unique nucleotide substitutions were identified with 31 of the 4,013 genomes remaining as ancestral type, and 952 (32.2%) mutations recurred in more than one genome. A viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations was the dominant genotype (80.9%) of the pandemic. We also identified unique genotypic compositions from different geographic locations, and time-series viral genotypic dynamics in the early phase that reveal transmission routes and subsequent expansion. We also used the same approach to analyze 261,350 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world over 12 months since the outbreak (i.e. all the available viral genomes in the GISAID database as of 25 December 2020).

These methods visualize airflow by visualizing density gradients in transparent media. The playing of professional woodwind and brass instrument players, as well as professional classical trained singers, were investigated to estimate the spread distances of the breathing air. For a better comparison and consistent measurement series, a single high and a single low note as well as an extract of a musical piece were investigated. Additionally, anemometry was used to determine the velocity of the spreading breathing air and the extent to which it was still quantifiable. The results presented in this article show there is no airflow escaping from the instruments, which is transported farther than 1.2 m into the room. However, differences in the various instruments have to be considered to assess properly the spread of the breathing air.

All donors were seropositive at the first sampling moment and only one donor seroreverted during follow-up analysis. Anti-RBD IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels slowly declined with median half-lifes of 62 and 59 days during 2-5 months after symptom onset, respectively. The rate of decline of antibody levels diminished during extended follow-up.

33,Continued need for non-pharmaceutical interventions after COVID-19 vaccination in long-term-care facilities,"Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) bear disproportionate burden of COVID-19 and are prioritized for vaccine deployment. LTCF outbreaks could continue occurring during vaccine rollout due to incomplete population coverage, and the effect of vaccines on viral transmission are currently unknown. Declining adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against within-facility transmission could therefore limit the effectiveness of vaccination. We built a stochastic model to simulate outbreaks in LTCF populations with differing vaccination coverage and NPI adherence to evaluate their interacting effects. Vaccination combined with strong NPI adherence produced the least morbidity and mortality. Healthcare worker vaccination improved outcomes in unvaccinated LTCF residents but was less impactful with declining NPI adherence. To prevent further illness and deaths, there is a continued need for NPIs in LTCFs during vaccine rollout.",Jay Love; Lindsay T Keegan; Frederick J Angulo; John McLaughlin; Kimberly M Shea; David L Swerdlow; Matthew H Samore; Damon JA Toth,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249339,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249339,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
34,Indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi: an interrupted time series analysis,"Background: Deaths from COVID-19 have exceeded 1.8 million globally (January 2021). We examined trends in markers of neonatal care before and during the pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi. Methods: We analysed data collected prospectively via the NeoTree app at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital (SMCH), Zimbabwe, and Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), Malawi. Neonates admitted from 1 June 2019 to 25 September 2020 were included. We modelled the impact of the first cases of COVID-19 (Zimbabwe: 20 March 2020; Malawi: 3 April 2020) on number of admissions, gestational age and birth weight, source of admission referrals, prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy, and overall mortality. Findings: The study included 3,450 neonates at SMCH and 3,350 neonates at KCH. Admission numbers at SMCH did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by 48% during a nurses' strike (Relative risk (RR) 0.52, 95%CI 0.40-0.68, p < 0.002). At KCH, admissions dropped by 42% (RR 0.58; 95%CI 0.48-0.70; p < 0.001) soon after the first case of COVID-19. At KCH, gestational age and birth weight decreased slightly (1 week, 300 grams), outside referrals dropped by 28%, and there was a slight weekly increase in mortality. No changes in these outcomes were found at SMCH. Interpretation: The indirect impacts of COVID-19 are context-specific. While this study provides vital evidence to inform health providers and policy makers, national data are required to ascertain the true impacts of the pandemic on newborn health.

35,"Construction of a demand and capacity model for intensive care and hospital ward beds, and mortality from COVID-19","Background This paper describes the construction of a model used to estimate the number of excess deaths that could be expected as a direct consequence of a lack of hospital bed and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Methods A series of compartmental models was used to estimate the number of deaths under different combinations of care required (ICU or ward), and care received (ICU, ward or no care) in England up to the end of April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information, organisations collating COVID-19 data and calculations using existing parameters. A compartmental sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent the increase in mortality that would be expected from a lack of provision of an ICU or general ward bed when one is required. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers, 'Optimistic', 'Middling' and 'Pessimistic', are described showing how the model can be used to estimate mortality rates under different scenarios of capacity. Results The key output of our collaboration was the model itself rather than the results of any of the scenarios. The model allows a user to understand the excess mortality impact arising as a direct consequence of capacity being breached under various scenarios or forecasts of hospital admissions. The scenarios described in this paper are illustrative and are not forecasts. There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in any of the 'Optimistic' scenario applications in sensitivity analysis. Several of the 'Middling' scenario applications under sensitivity testing resulted in excess deaths directly attributable to a lack of capacity. Most excess deaths arose when we modelled a 20% reduction comparted to best estimate ICU capacity. This led to 597 deaths (0.7% increase). All the 'Pessimistic' scenario applications under sensitivity analysis had excess deaths. These ranged from 49,219 (19.4% increase) when we modelled a 20% increase in ward bed availability over the best-estimate, to 103,845 (40.9% increase) when we modelled a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability below the best-estimate. The emergence of a new, more transmissible variant (VOC 202012/01) increases the likelihood of real-world outcomes at, or beyond, those modelled in our 'Pessimistic' scenario. The results can be explained by considering how capacity evolves in each of the scenarios. In the Middling scenario, whilst ICU capacity may be high and even possibly breached, there remains sufficient ward capacity to take lives who need either ward or ICU support, keeping excess deaths relatively low. However, the Pessimistic scenario sees ward capacity breached, and in many scenarios for a period of several weeks, resulting in much higher mortality in those lives who require care but do not receive it. Conclusions No excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the unadjusted 'Optimistic' assumptions of demand. The 'Middling' scenario could result in some excess deaths from breaching capacity, though these would be small (0.7% increase) relative to the total number of deaths in that scenario. The 'Pessimistic' scenario would certainly result in significant excess deaths from breaching capacity. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,219 (19.4% increase) and 103,845 (40.9% increase) excess deaths. Without the new variant, exceeding capacity for hospital and ICU beds was not the most likely outcome but given the new variant it now appears more plausible and, if so, would result in a substantial increase in the number of deaths from COVID-19.",Stuart McDonald; Christopher John Martin; Steve Bale; Michiel Luteijn; Rahuldeb Sarkar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249341,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249341,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
36,Evaluation of at-home methods for N95 filtering facepiece respirator decontamination,"Shortages in N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are significant as FFRs are essential for the protection of healthcare professionals and other high-risk groups against Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In response to these shortages during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permitting FFR decontamination and reuse. However, although industrial decontamination services are available at some large institutions, FFR decontamination is not widely available. Effective FFR decontamination must 1) deactivate the virus; 2) preserve FFR integrity, specifically fit and filtering capability; and 3) be non-toxic and safe. Here we identify and compare at-home methods for heat-based FFR decontamination that meet these requirements, but utilize common household appliances. Our results identify viable protocols for simple and accessible FFR decontamination, while also highlighting methods that may jeopardize FFR integrity and should be avoided.",Tiffany X Chen; Ana Pinharanda; Keiko Yasuma-Mitobe; Elaine Lee; Natalie A Steinemann; Jaeseung Hahn; Lydia Wu; Stavros Fanourakis; Darcy S Peterka; Elizabeth M.

37,The Effect of Frames on COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,"In order to control the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it will be important to develop a communication strategy to counteract ""vaccine hesitancy"". This paper reports the results of a survey experiment testing the impacts of several types of message content: the safety and efficacy of the vaccine itself, the likelihood that others will take the vaccine, and the possible role of politics in promoting the vaccine. In an original survey of 1123 American M-Turk respondents, we provided six different information conditions suggesting the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, the lack of safety/efficacy of the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would take the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would not take the vaccine, the suggestion that the vaccine is being promoted to gain greater control over individual freedom, and the suggestion that it is being rushed for political motivations. We compared the responses for those in the treatment groups with a control group who received no additional information. In comparison to the control group, those who received information about the safety/efficacy of the vaccine were more likely to report that they would take the vaccine, those who received information that others were reluctant to take the vaccine were more likely to report that they themselves would not take it, that other Americans would not take it, and that it was not important to get the vaccine, and those who received information about political influences on vaccine development expressed hesitancy to take it. Communication of effective messages about the vaccine will be essential for public health agencies that seek to promote vaccine take-up.",Risa Palm; Toby Bolsen; Justin Kingsland,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249241,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249241,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
38,Coronavirus-19 and coagulopathy: A Systematic Review,"Background: Understanding the association between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and coagulopathy may assist clinical prognostication, and influence treatment and outcomes. We aimed to systematically describe the relationship between hemostatic laboratory parameters and important clinical outcomes among adults with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials, observational studies and case series published in PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and CENTRAL from December 1, 2019 to March 25, 2020. Studies of adult patients with COVID-19 that reported at least one hemostatic laboratory parameter were included. Results: Data were extracted from 57 studies (N=12,050 patients) that met inclusion criteria. The average age of patients was 52 years and 45% were women. Of the included studies, 92.7% (N=38/41 studies) reported an average platelet count greater than or equal to 150 x 109/L, 68.2% (N=15/22 studies) reported an average prothrombin time (PT) between 11-14 s, 55% (N=11/20 studies) reported an average activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) between 25-35 s, and 34.4% (N=11/32 studies) reported a D-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal (ULN). Eight studies (7 cohorts and 1 case series) reported hemostatic lab values for survivors versus non-survivors. Among non-survivors, D-dimer concentrations were reported in 4 studies and all reported an average above the ULN. Interpretation: Most patients had a normal platelet count, elevated D-dimer, PT and aPTT values in the upper reference interval; D-dimer elevation appeared to correlate with poor outcomes. Further studies are needed to better correlate these hemostatic parameters with the risk of adverse outcomes such as thrombosis and bleeding.",Stephanie G Lee; Michael Fralick; Grace Tang; Brandon Tse; Lisa Baumann Kreuziger; Mary Cushman; Peter Juni; Michelle Sholzberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20248202,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20248202,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
39,Use of the FebriDx point-of-care assay as part of a triage algorithm for medical admissions with possible COVID-19,"Background: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 must be rapidly identified and isolated to prevent nosocomial transmission. However, isolation facilities are often limited, and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results are too slow to inform emergency department triage. We evaluated a pragmatic triage algorithm to isolate patients with suspected COVID-19 using simple clinical criteria and the FebriDx assay. Methods: All medical admissions in a large UK hospital were triaged as likely, possible or unlikely COVID-19 based on clinical criteria. Patients triaged as possible COVID-19 underwent FebriDx lateral flow assay on capillary blood, and those who tested MxA positive were isolated. We evaluated the accuracy of the algorithm and the FebriDx assay compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs as the reference standard. Results: Between 10th August 2020 and 4th November 2020, 136/3,443 medical admissions (4.0%) were diagnosed with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID-19 was 45.7% (80/175) in those triaged as likely, 4.1% (50/1,225) in possible and 6/2,033 (0.3%) in unlikely COVID-19. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, clinical triage had sensitivity of 95.6% (130/136) and specificity of 61.5% (2027/3297), whilst the triage algorithm including FebriDx had sensitivity of 92.6% (126/136) and specificity of 86.4% (2849/3297). The triage algorithm reduced the need for 2,859 patients to be admitted to isolation rooms. The patients missed by the algorithm had mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Conclusions: A simple triage algorithm including FebriDx assay had good sensitivity and is a useful rule-out for COVID-19. The algorithm is useful for managing medical admissions from the emergency department.",Hamish Houston; Ankur Gupta-Wright; Gavin Deas; Shivam Naik; Kamal Shah; Shiras Patel; Maria Greca Dottori; Michael Tay; Sarah Filson; James Biggin-Lamming; John Ross; Natalie Vaughan; Nidhi Vaid; Guduru Gopal Rao; Amit Amin; Laurence John,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249154,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249154,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
40,Reverse Transcriptase Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for COVID-19 Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe outbreak and become a global public health priority. Rapid increment of infection number along with significant deaths have placed the virus as a serious threat to human health. Rapid, reliable, and simple diagnostic methods are critically essential for disease control. While Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the current diagnostic gold standard, Reverse Transcriptase Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) appears as a compelling alternative diagnostic test due to its more simplicity, shorter time to result, and lower cost. This study examined RT-LAMP application for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR assay.

MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis (2020) was conducted in 6 scientific databases following the PRISMA Guideline. Original published studies on human clinical samples in English were included. Articles evaluated sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP relative to RT-PCR were considered eligible. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was examined based on QUADAS-2.

ResultsA total of 351 studies were found based on the keywords and search queries. 14 eligible case control studies fitted the respective criteria. Quality assessment using QUADAS-2 indicated low risk bias in all included studies. All case studies, comprises 2,112 samples, had the cumulative sensitivity of 95.5% (CI 97.5%=90.8-97.9%) and cumulative specificity of 99.5% (CI 97.5%=97.7-99.9%).

41,"Modeling COVID-19 outbreaks in United States with distinct testing, lockdown speed and fatigue rates","Each state in the United States exhibited a unique response to the COVID-19 outbreak, along with variable levels of testing, leading to different actual case burdens in the country. In this study, via per-capita testing dependent ascertainment rates, along with case and death data, we fit a minimal epidemic model for each state. We estimate infection-level responsive lockdown entry and exit rates (representing government and behavioral reaction), along with the true number of cases as of May 31, 2020. Ultimately we provide error corrected estimates for commonly used metrics such as infection fatality ratio and overall case ascertainment for all 55 states and territories considered, along with the United States in aggregate, in order to correlate outbreak severity with first wave intervention attributes and suggest potential management strategies for future outbreaks.

We propose an interpretable machine learning approach for forecasting pandemic transmission rates by utilizing local mobility statistics and government policies. A calibration step is introduced to deal with time-varying relationships between transmission rates and predictors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to make accurate two-week ahead predictions of the state-level COVID-19 infection trends in the US. Moreover, the models trained by our approach offer insights into the spread of COVID-19, such as the association between the baseline transmission rate and the state-level demographics, the effectiveness of local policies in reducing COVID-19 infections, and so on. This work provides a good understanding of COVID-19 evolution with respect to state-level characteristics and can potentially inform local policymakers in devising customized response strategies.",Yifei Wang; Hao Peng; Long Sha; Zheyuan Liu; Pengyu Hong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249218,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249218,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
43,Outbreak or pseudo-outbreak? Integrating SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to validate infection control practices in an end stage renal disease facility,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 poses a particularly high risk for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients and led to a need for facility-wide control plans to prevent introduction and spread of infection within ESRD facilities. Rapid identification of clusters of contemporaneous cases is essential, as these may be indicative of within-facility spread. Nevertheless, in a setting of high community COVID-19 prevalence, a series of ESRD patients may test positive at around the same time without their shared ESRD facility being the nexus for disease spread. Here we describe a series of five cases occurring within an eleven-day period in November 2020 in a hospital-based 32-station ESRD facility in southwest Wisconsin, the subsequent facility-wide testing, and the use of genetic sequence analysis of positive specimens to evaluate whether these cases were linked.

MethodsFour patient cases and one staff case were identified in symptomatic individuals by RT-PCR. Facility-wide screening was initiated at the request of local public health and conducted using Abbot BinaxNOW antigen tests. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from residual diagnostic test specimens using an amplicon-based approach on an Ion Torrent S5 sequencer.

ResultsResidual specimens from 4 of 5 cases were available for sequence analysis. Each sequence was very clearly genetically distinct from the others, indicating that these contemporaneous cases were not linked. Facility-wide screening of 47 staff and 107 patients did not identify any additional cases.

ConclusionsThese data indicate that despite the outward appearance of a case cluster, the facility did not experience within-facility spread nor serve as the epicenter of a new outbreak, suggesting that the enacted rigorous infection control procedures (screening, masking, distancing) practiced stringently by patients and staff were sufficient to permit dialysis to proceed safely in a very high-risk population under pressure from increasing community spread. These data also demonstrate the utility of rapid turnaround SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in outbreak investigations in settings like ESRD facilities.",Bridget L Pfaff; Craig S Richmond; Arick P Sabin; Deena M Athas; Jessica C Adams; Megan E Meller; Kumari Usha; Sarah A Schmitz; Brian J Simmons; Andrew J Borgert; Paraic A Kenny,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249062,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249062,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True

Hemodialysis patients who receive life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and staff with physical interaction and in close proximity. Despite the importance and critical situation of the dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we have used a combination of discrete event and agent-based simulation models, to study the operations of a typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix comprising the number and duration of contacts at a micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission under different scenarios. The results show that micro-simulation can be used to estimate contact matrices, which can be used effectively for disease modelling in dialysis and similar settings.",Mohammadali Tofighi; Ali Asgary; Asad A.

46,Covid19Risk.ai: An open source repository and online calculator of prediction models for early diagnosis and prognosis of Covid-19,"Objective The current pandemic has led to a proliferation of predictive models being developed to address various aspects of COVID-19 patient care. We aimed to develop an online platform that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models transition from research to clinical practice. Methods In this proof-of-principle study, we performed a literature search in PubMed and WHO database to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles. Results The open source website https :// covid 19 risk . ai /   currently incorporates nine models from six different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world impact of their work. Conclusion We have successfully demonstrated in this proof-of-principle study that our website provides an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19. It enables doctors to supplement their judgment with patient-specific predictions from externally-validated models in a user-friendly format.

47,Syncope and COVID-19 disease - a systematic review.,"BackgroundSyncope is not a common manifestation of COVID-19, but it may occur in this context and it can be the presenting symptom in some cases. Although several mechanisms may explain the pathophysiology behind COVID-19 related syncope, a valid relationship has not been established yet. In this systematic review, we aimed to examine the current incidence of syncope in COVID-19 patients and to explore different patterns observed in this setting.

MethodsA systematic review across PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS was performed, according to PRISMA guidelines, in order to identify all relevant articles regarding both COVID-19 and syncope.

ResultsWe identified 81 publications, of which 62 were excluded. The cumulative incidence of syncope and pre-syncope across the selected studies was 7.1% (256/3584 patients). Unspecified syncope was the most common type (76.2% of the reported episodes), followed by reflex syncope (18.1% of the cases). Orthostatic hypotension was responsible for 3.6% of the cases and syncope of presumable cardiac cause accounted for 2.0%. Arterial hypertension was present in 64.7% of the patients and either angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used by 39.5% of hypertensive patients with syncope.

ConclusionSyncope, although not considered a typical symptom of the COVID-19 disease, can be associated with it, particularly in early stages. Different types of syncope were seen in this context, each with different implications requiring distinct approaches. A careful reevaluation of blood pressure whenever a patient develops COVID-19 is suggested, including reassessment of antihypertensive therapy.",Raquel Falcao de Freitas; Sofia Cardoso Torres; Jose Pedro L.

48,Hospitalization as reliable indicator of second wave COVID-19 pandemic in eight European countries,"Time dependent reproduction number (Rt) is one of the most popular parameters to track the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. However, especially at the initial stages, Rt can be highly underestimated because of remarkable differences between the actual number of infected people and the daily incidence of people who are tested positive. Here, we present the analysis of daily cumulative number of hospitalized (HP) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients both in space and in time in the early phases of second wave COVID-19 pandemic across eight different European countries, namely Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and United Kingdom. We derive simple model equations to fit the time dependence of these two variables where exponential behavior is observed. Growth rate constants of HP and ICU are listed, providing country-specific parameters able to estimate the burden of SARS-COV-2 infection before extensive containment measures take place. Our quantitative parameters, fully related to hospitalizations, are disentangled from the capacity range of the screening campaign, for example the number of swabs, and they cannot be directly biased by the actual number of infected people. This approach can give an array of reliable indicators which can be used by governments and healthcare systems to monitor the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic.",Mattia Allieta; Davide Rossi Sebastiano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249084,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249084,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
49,Optimizing testing for COVID-19 in India,"COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage.

India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met.

Author summaryUsing network models, we study optimal ways of combining low sensitivity, relatively inexpensive point-of-care rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 with higher sensitivity but more expensive laboratory RT-PCR tests. We take into account background seroprevalence and current test pricing for such tests in India, finding that even purely rapid antigen test-based regimes can produce the same reduction in overall infections that pure RT-PCR tests are capable of. This is provided one can test at scale and isolate those testing positive effectively, that the sensitivity of the rapid test is not too low and that non-pharmaceutical interventions proceed in parallel for increased effectiveness.",Philip Cherian; Sandeep Krishna; Gautam I Menon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249106,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249106,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
50,"Empty Streets, Speeding and Motor Vehicle Collisions during Covid-19 Lockdowns: Evidence from Northern Ireland","Covid-19 and lockdowns have had spillover effects on other health outcomes. Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are likely to have been affected by the pandemic due to, among others, less traffic volume and speeding on empty streets. This paper studies the impact of the pandemic on MVCs in Northern Ireland. Using monthly data on injuries and deaths, we find a steep decline in slight and serious injuries compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. However, we find no effect on the number of deaths. Based on data from speeding tickets, a plausible explanation for the differential effect on the number of injuries and deaths is speeding on empty streets during the pandemic.",Sotiris Vandoros; Fotis Papailias,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249173,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249173,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
51,Prediction of confirmed and death cases of Covid-19 in Chile through time series techniques: A comparative study,"(1) BackgroundChile has become one of the countries most affected by Covid-19, a pandemic that has generated a large number of cases worldwide, which if not detected and treated in time can cause multi-organic failure and even death. The social determinants of health such as education, work, social security, housing, environment, support networks and social cohesion are important aspects to consider for the control and intervention of this pathology. Therefore, it is essential to have information about the progress of the infections at the national level and thus apply effective public health interventions. In this paper, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile and thus support the decisions of health agencies;

(2) MethodsWe modeled the confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile by using ARIMA models, exponential smoothing techniques, Poisson models for time-dependent counting data. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by using a training set and test set;

(3) ResultsThe database used in this paper allows us to say that for the confirmed Covid-19 cases the best model corresponds to a well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model, whereas for deaths from Covid-19 in Chile the best model resulted in damped trend method;

52,OPTIMIZING COVID-19 VACCINE USAGE,"As the worldwide vaccination, it is imperative to minimize vaccine wastage by effectively using all doses available. Vaccine wastage can occur at multiple points during the vaccination process, but it is mainly because the device dead space and the filling process technique. However, there are no studies discussing the waste volume effect of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical practice. There is an increasing COVID-19 vaccine demand that we estimate up to several billion dual doses. The objective of this study was to assess the number of 0.3mL doses obtained from a multiple-dose vial using 1ml and 3ml syringes with different type of needles replicating the first COVID-19 vaccination protocol.

Our results suggest that it is possible to obtain six or seven doses from each vial instead five. We provide evidence to optimize between 20% and 40% additional vaccine doses per vial if the current 5-dose vials are used, making scarce supplies go further.

It is our duty, as researchers, to ensure the efficacy and efficiency of the worldwide COVID-19 vaccination process.

53,Augmented curation of clinical notes of COVID-19 and influenza patients reveals that long-term neuropsychiatric and coagulopathic symptoms are more associated with COVID-19,"Less than one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, over 70 million individuals worldwide have been infected and case counts continue to accelerate, yet the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are unknown. We leverage  augmented curation to extract symptoms and signs occurring post - COVID as noted in follow up physicians notes of COVID-19 patients at the Mayo Clinic who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and September 2020, or influenza between 2014 and 2019. We compare the chart prevalence of signs/symptoms and diseases in the 3-to-6 month post-diagnosis vs. 1-to-6 month pre-diagnosis period for each disease, and subsequently compare the observed effect size of each symptom across the two diseases. Relative to post-influenza, we observe a significant increase in the chart prevalence of terms including ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""obesity"", and ""bleeding"" in COVID-19 patients under the age of 55. Across all age groups, ""nodules"" and ""cysts"" were also significantly increased.

54,The impact of vitamin D supplementation on mortality rate and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundSeveral studies have suggested the positive impact of vitamin D on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes and mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted through the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Embase, Ovid, and The Cochrane Library with no limitation in time and language, until December 16, 2020. The results were screened based on their accordance with the subject. Two independent reviewers selected the eligible studies and the outcomes of interest were extracted. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Quasi-Experimental Studies, the remaining results were appraised critically. Statistical analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.0.

ResultsOf the 2311 results, 1305 duplicated results were removed. After screening the titles, abstracts, and the full-text articles of the remaining records, four studies and 259 patients were enrolled, including 139 patients in vitamin D intervention groups. In three of the studies, the patients survival and mortality rate were evaluated. The pooled analysis of these studies showed a significantly lower mortality rate among the intervention groups (10.56%) compared with the control groups (23.88%) (OR = 0.264, 95% CI = 0.099-0.708, p-value = 0.008). Two of the studies reported the clinical outcomes based on the World Health Organizations Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) score for COVID-19, where both of them showed a significant decrease in OSCI score in the vitamin D intervention groups. Additionally, One study reported a lower rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and one study reported a significant decrease in serum levels of Fibrinogen.

55,"The social experience of participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial: Subjects' motivations, others' concerns, and insights for vaccine promotion","BackgroundVaccine hesitancy could undermine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Knowledge about peoples lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake.

AimTo use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process.

MethodsWe interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of peoples lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making.

ResultsParticipants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing ones duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe.

ConclusionThese findings regarding participants reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.",Emily Wentzell; Ana-Monica Racila,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249051,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249051,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
56,Different selection dynamics of S and RdRp between SARS-CoV-2 genomes with and without the dominant mutations,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide, with no dedicated treatment or vaccine currently available. As pharmaceutical research against and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their efficacy, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C>T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A>G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher positive selection in mutant isolates early on, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.",Necla Koçhan; Doğa Eskier; Asli Suner; Gökhan Karakülah; Yavuz Oktay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20237602,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20237602,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
57,Pharmacokinetic modelling to estimate intracellular favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate exposure to support posology for SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe role of favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19 is unclear, with discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, concerns about teratogenicity and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. In Vero-E6 cells, high concentrations are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this analysis was to use available data to simulate intracellular pharmacokinetics of favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP) to better understand the putative applicability as a COVID-19 intervention.

MethodsPreviously published in vitro data for the intracellular production and elimination of FAVI- RTP in MDCK cells incubated with parent favipiravir was fitted with a mathematical model to describe the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations as a function of incubation concentration of parent favipiravir. Parameter estimates from this model fitting were then combined with a previously published population PK model for the plasma exposure of parent favipiravir in Chinese patients with severe influenza (the modelled free plasma concentration of favipiravir substituting for in vitro incubation concentration) to predict the human intracellular FAVI-RTP pharmacokinetics.

ResultsIn vitro FAVI-RTP data was adequately described as a function of in vitro incubation media concentrations of parent favipiravir with an empirical model, noting that the model simplifies and consolidates various processes and is used under various assumptions and within certain limits. Parameter estimates from the fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP when driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile.

ConclusionThis modelling approach has several important limitations that are discussed in the main text of the manuscript. However, the simulations indicate that despite rapid clearance of the parent drug from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life. Population average intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to maintain the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 3 days following 800 mg BID dosing and 9 days following 1200 mg BID dosing after a 1600 mg BID loading dose on day 1.

58,Prior Bariatric Surgery in COVID-19 Positive Patients May Be Protective,"IntroductionPatients infected with novel COVID-19 virus have a spectrum of illnesses ranging from asymptomatic to death. Data has shown that age, gender and obesity are strongly correlated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. Bariatric surgery is the only treatment that provides significant, sustained weight loss in the severely obese. We look at whether prior bariatric surgery correlates with increased risk of hospitalization and outcome severity after COVID-19 infection.

MethodsA cross-sectional retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 database from a single, NYC-based, academic institution was conducted. A cohort of COVID-19 positive patients with a history of bariatric surgery (n=124) were matched in a 4:1 ratio to a control cohort of COVID-19 positive patients who were eligible for bariatric surgery (BMI [&ge;]40 kg/m2 or BMI [&ge;]35 kg/m2 with a comorbidity) (n=496). A comparison of outcomes, including mechanical ventilation requirements and deceased at discharge, was done between cohorts using Chi-square test or Fishers exact test. Additionally, overall length of stay and duration of time in ICU were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Conditional logistic regression analyses were done to determine both unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR).

ResultsA total of 620 COVID-19 positive patients were included in this analysis. The categorization of bariatric surgeries included 36% Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB, n=45), 35% laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n=44), and 28% laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n=35). The body mass index (BMI) for the bariatric group was 36.1 kg/m2 (SD=8.3), which was significantly lower than the control group, 41.4 kg/m2 (SD=6.5) (p<0.0001). There was also less burden of diabetes in the bariatric group (32%) compared to the control group (48%) (p=0.0019). Patients with a history of bariatric surgery were less likely to be admitted through the emergency room (UOR=0.39, p=0.0001), less likely to have had a ventilator used during the admission (UOR=0.42, p=0.028), had a shorter length of stay in both the ICU (p=0.033) and overall (UOR=0.44, p=0.0002), and were less likely to be deceased at discharge compared to the control group (OR=0.42, p=0.028).

Current risk prediction for CV complications in COVID-19 is limited and existing approaches fail to account for the dynamic course of the disease. Here, we develop and validate the COVID-HEART predictor, a novel continuously-updating risk prediction technology to forecast CV complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The risk predictor is trained and tested with retrospective registry data from 2178 patients to predict two outcomes: cardiac arrest and imaging-confirmed thromboembolic events. In validating the model, we show that it predicts cardiac arrest with a median early warning time of 14 hours and an AUROC of 0.93, and thromboembolic events with a median early warning time of 168 hours and an AUROC of 0.85.

60,Optimizing vaccine allocation for COVID-19 vaccines: critical role of single-dose vaccination.,"Most of the COVID-19 vaccines require two doses, at least 3 weeks apart. In the first few months of vaccine deployment, vaccine shortages will be inevitable. Current vaccine prioritization guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines all assume two-dose vaccine deployment. However, vaccinating twice as many people with a single dose of vaccine might be a better use of resources. Utilizing an age-stratified mathematical model combined with optimization algorithms, we determined the optimal vaccine allocation with one and two doses of vaccine to minimize five key metrics of disease burden (total infections, symptomatic infections, deaths, peak non-ICU and ICU hospitalizations) under a variety of assumptions (different levels of social distancing, vaccine availability, vaccines mode of action, vaccination rate). Our results suggest that maintaining current social distancing interventions and speedy vaccine deployment are key for successful vaccination campaigns. Further, we show that the optimal allocation of vaccine critically depends on the single-dose efficacy (SDE). If the SDE is high, then under the majority of scenarios considered, single-dose vaccination is the optimal use of vaccine, preventing up to 48% more deaths than a strategy allocating vaccine to the high-risk (older age groups in our model) first. If the SDE is low or medium, then our results suggest that mixed vaccination campaigns with one and two doses of vaccine are best. Our work suggests that it is an absolute imperative to quickly and fully determine the efficacy of single-dose vaccines, as single-dose vaccinations can put an end to this pandemic much more quickly.",Laura Matrajt; Julia Eaton,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249099,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249099,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True

62,COVID-19 immunization threshold(s): an analysis,"2As COVID-19 vaccine research efforts seem to be yielding the first tangible results, the proportion of individuals needed to reap the benefits of herd immunity is a key element from a Public Health programs perspective.

This magnitude, termed the critical immunization threshold (q), can be obtained from the classical SIR model equilibrium equation, equaling (1 - 1/R0)/ {epsilon}, where R0 is the basic reproduction number and{epsilon} is the vaccine efficacy. When a significant proportion of the population is already immune, this becomes (n - 1/R0)/ {epsilon}, where n is the proportion of non-immune individuals. A similar equation can be obtained for short-term immunization thresholds(qt), which are dependent on Rt.

qs for most countries are between 60-75% of the population. Current qt for most countries are between 20-40%.

Therefore, the combination of gradual vaccination and other non-pharmaceutical interventions will mark the transition to the herd immunity, providing that the later turns out to be a feasible objective.

64,Value of radiomics features from adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images predicting COVID-19 progression,"BackgroundValue of radiomics features from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images for predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 has not been studied.

MethodsA total of 1,245 patients (685 moderate and 560 severe patients) were enrolled in a retrospective study. We proposed 3D V-Net to segment adrenal glands in onset CT images automatically, and periadrenal fat was obtained using inflation operation around the adrenal gland. Next, we built a clinical model (CM), three radiomics models (adrenal gland model [AM], periadrenal fat model [PM], and fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model [FM]), and radiomics nomogram (RN) after radiomics features extracted to predict disease progression in patients with COVID-19.

ResultsThe auto-segmentation framework yielded a dice value of 0.79 in the training set. CM, AM, PM, FM, and RN obtained AUCs of 0.712, 0.692, 0.763, 0.791, and 0.806, respectively in the training set. FM and RN had better predictive efficacy than CM (P < 0.0001) in the training set. RN showed that there was no significant difference in the validation set (mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.04) and test set (MAE = 0.075) between predictive and actual results. Decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability was more than 0.3 in the validation set or between 0.4 and 0.8 in the test set, it could gain more net benefits using RN than FM and CM.

65,"The incidence, characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalized with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK from March to September 2020: a national cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS)","BackgroundEvidence on risk factors, incidence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant mothers and their babies has rapidly expanded but there is a lack of population level data to inform accurate incidence rates and unbiased descriptions of characteristics and outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to describe the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2 in order to inform future clinical guidance and management.

Methods and FindingsWe conducted a national, prospective cohort study of all hospitalized pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 1st March 2020 to 31st August 2020 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) across all 194 hospitals in the UK with a consultant-led maternity unit. Incidence was estimated using the latest national maternity data. Overall, 1148 hospitalized women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, 63% of which were symptomatic. Therefore, the estimated incidence of hospitalization with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 2.0 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.9-2.2) and for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 1.2 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.1-1.4). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.48 and aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.53-2.29 respectively), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, 95% CI 3.93-9.90, aOR 4.36, 95% CI 3.19-5.95 and aOR 12.95, 95% CI 4.93-34.01 respectively), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.32-2.54). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, 95% CI 7.80-426.70) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low. Cesarean births and neonatal unit admission were increased regardless of symptom status (symptomatic aOR 2.60, 95% CI 1.97-3.42 and aOR 3.08, 95% CI 1.99-4.77 respectively; asymptomatic aOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.52-2.70 and aOR 1.84, 95% 1.12-3.03 respectively). Iatrogenic preterm births were more common in women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (aOR 11.43, 95% CI 5.07-25.75). The risks of stillbirth or neonatal death were not significantly increased, regardless of symptom status but numbers were small. The limitations of this study include the restriction to women hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2, who may by nature of their admission have been at greater risk of adverse outcome.

ConclusionsWe have identified factors that increase the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. The increased risks of cesarean and iatrogenic preterm birth provide clear evidence of the indirect impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mothers and maternity care in high income settings. Clinicians can be reassured that the majority of women do not experience severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and women with mild disease can be discharged to continue their pregnancy safely.",Nicola Vousden; Kathryn Bunch; Edward Morris; Nigel Simpson; Christopher Gale; Patrick O'Brien; Maria Quigley; Peter Brocklehurst; Jennifer J Kurinczuk; Marian Knight,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249195,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249195,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
66,SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of cell lines and substrates commonly used in diagnosis and isolation of influenza and other viruses,"Coinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other viruses is inevitable as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. This study aimed to evaluate cell lines commonly used in virus diagnosis and isolation for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. While multiple kidney cell lines from monkeys were susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2, many cell types derived from human, dog, mink, cat, mouse, or chicken were not. Analysis of MDCK cells, which are most commonly used for surveillance and study of influenza viruses, demonstrated that they were insusceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that the cellular barrier to productive infection was due to low expression level of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and lower receptor affinity to SARS-CoV-2 spike, which could be overcome by over-expression of canine ACE2 in trans. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism did not appear to be affected by a D614G mutation in the spike protein.",Li Wang; Xiaoyu Fan; Gaston Bonenfant; Dan Cui; Jaber Hossain; Nannan Jiang; Gloria Larson; Michael Currier; Jimma Liddell; Malania Wilson; Azaibi Tamin; Jennifer Harcourt; Jessica Ciomperlik-Patton; Hong Pang; Naomi Dybdahl-Sissoko; Ray Campagnoli; Pei-Yong Shi; John R Barnes; Natalie J.

67,Synergistic interferon alpha-based drug combinations inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections in vitro,"Antiviral drugs are powerful tools to combat emerging viral diseases, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. However, most existing antivirals have failed to cure COVID-19. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for new therapeutics with powerful antiviral and tolerable side effects. Here, we observed that recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFNa) triggered cell intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral responses and reduced replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. However, IFNa alone was insufficient to completely abolish SARS-CoV-2 replication. The combinations of IFNa with camostat, remdesivir, EIDD-2801, cycloheximide or convalescent serum showed strong synergy and, therefore, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity of IFNa2a with pimodivir against influenza A virus (FluAV) infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells, as well as IFNa2a with lamivudine against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in human TZM-bl cells. Our results indicate that IFNa2a-based combinational therapies help to reduce drug dose and improve efficacy in comparison with monotherapies, making them attractive targets for further pre-clinical and clinical development. Additionally, they have powerful treatment potential, and can be leveraged for use in the inhibition of not only emerging or re-emerging viruses, but also immune-evading or drug-resistant viral variants, and viral co-infections.",Aleksandr Ianevski; Rouan Yao; Eva Zusinaite; Laura Sandra Lello; Sainan Wang; Eunji Jo; Jaewon Yang; Hilde Lysvand; Kirsti Loseth; Valentyn Oksenych; Tanel Tenson; Marc P.

68,Crystallographic molecular replacement using an in silico-generated search model of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8,"The majority of crystal structures are determined by the method of molecular replacement (MR). The range of application of MR is limited mainly by the need for an accurate search model. In most cases, pre-existing experimentally determined structures are used as search models. In favorable cases, ab initio predicted structures have yielded search models adequate for molecular replacement. The ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a challenging case for MR using an ab initio prediction because ORF8 has an all {beta}-sheet fold and few orthologs. We previously determined experimentally the structure of ORF8 using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method, having been unable to find an MR solution to the crystallographic phase problem. Following a report of an accurate prediction of the ORF8 structure, we assessed whether the predicted model would have succeeded as an MR search model. A phase problem solution was found, and the resulting structure was refined, yielding structural parameters equivalent to the original experimental solution.",Thomas G Flower; James H Hurley,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425441,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425441,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,False

One hundred (100) percent (%) of untreated control mice remained alive throughout the experiment. By comparison, 100% of LPS-GalN injected mice died at a median of 4.6 hours. In contrast to the invariably fatal treatment outcome of vehicle-treated control mice, 40% of mice treated with RJX (n=25) remained alive with a 2.4-fold longer median time survival time of 10.9 hours (Log-rank X2=20.60, P<0.0001). Notably, RJX increased the tissue levels of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, and reduced oxidative stress in the brain.

70,Hydroxyzine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to ACE2 in a qualitative in vitro assay,"COVID-19 currently represents a major public health problem. Multiple efforts are being performed to control this disease. Vaccinations are already in progress. However, no effective treatments have been found so far. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that through the Spike protein interacts with its cell surface receptor ACE2 to enter into the host cells. Therefore, compounds able to block this interaction may help to stop disease progression. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of compounds reported to interact and modify the activity of ACE2 on the binding of the Spike protein. Among the compounds tested, we found that hydroxyzine could inhibit the binding of the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein to ACE2 in a qualitative in vitro assay. This finding supports the reported clinical data showing the benefits of hydroxyzine on COVID-19 patients, raising the need for further investigation into its effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 given its well-characterized medical properties and affordable cost.",Maria Dolores Rivas; Jose Maria Rafael Saponi-Cortes; Jose Zamorano,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.424792,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.424792,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,False
71,"Immunogenicity of an AAV-based, room-temperature stable, single dose COVID-19 vaccine in mice and non-human primates","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected more than 70 million people worldwide and resulted in over 1.5 million deaths. A broad deployment of effective immunization campaigns to achieve population immunity at global scale will depend on the biological and logistical attributes of the vaccine. Here, two adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based vaccine candidates demonstrate potent immunogenicity in mouse and nonhuman primates following a single injection. Peak neutralizing antibody titers remain sustained at 5 months and are complemented by functional memory T-cells responses. The AAVrh32.33 capsid of the AAVCOVID vaccine is an engineered AAV to which no relevant pre-existing immunity exists in humans. Moreover, the vaccine is stable at room temperature for at least one month and is produced at high yields using established commercial manufacturing processes in the gene therapy industry.

72,Molecular Mechanism of the N501Y Mutation for Enhanced Binding between SARS-CoV-2's Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Receptor,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an ongoing global pandemic for over a year. Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2s spike protein might have enhanced the viral proteins binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.

73,In-Vitro Fluorescence Microscopy Studies Show Retention of Spike-Protein (SARS-Cov-2) on Cell Membrane in the Presence of Amodiaquin Dihydrochloride Dihydrate Drug,"The ability of S-glycoprotein (S-protein) in SARS-Cov-2 to bind to the host cell receptor protein (angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) leading to its entry in cellular system determines its contagious index and global spread. Three available drugs (Riboflavin, Amodiaquin dihydrochloride dihydrate (ADD) and Remidesivir) were investigated to understand the kinetics of S-protein and its entry inside a cellular environment. Optical microscopy and fluorescence-based assays on 293T cells (transfected with ACE2 plasmid) were used as the preamble for assessing the behaviour of S-protein in the presence of these drugs for the first 12 hours post S-protein - ACE2 binding. Preliminary results suggest relatively long retention of S-protein on the cell membrane in the presence of ADD drug. Evident from the %-overlap and colocalization of S-protein with endosome studies, a large fraction of S-protein entering the cell escape endosomal degradation process, suggesting S-protein takes non-endocytic mediated entry in the presence of ADD, whereas in the presence of Riboflavin, S-protein carry out normal endocytic pathway, comparable to control (no drug) group. Therefore, present study indicates ADD potentially affects S-proteins entry mechanism (endocytic pathway) in addition to its reported target action mechanism. Hence, ADD substantially interfere with S-protein cellular entrance mechanism. However, further detailed studies at molecular scale will clarify our understanding of exact intermediate molecular processes. The present study (based on limited data) reveal ADD could be potential candidate to manage Covid-19 functions through yet unknown molecular mechanism.",Partha Pratim Mondal; Subhra Mandal,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.424956,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.424956,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,False

PAI-1, t-PA and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. Increased levels of PAI-1 likely result in lower plasmin activity and hence decreased fibrinolysis. These observations provide a partial explanation for the fibrin- mediated increase in blood viscosity and hypercoagulability that has previously been observed in COVID-19.

75,"COVID-19: Can early home treatment with Azithromycin alone or with Zinc help prevent hospitalisation, death, and long-COVID-19? A review","IntroductionThe effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to disrupt health systems worldwide, leading to population lockdowns in many countries. Preventing hospitalisation, death and long-COVID-19 with repurposed drugs remains a priority. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are the most commonly used in ambulatory care, with divergent results. With the aim of decentralizing early treatment to family practitioners, we addressed the question: Can early home treatment with AZM alone or with zinc help prevent hospitalisation, death, and long-COVID-19?

MethodologyWe conducted a scoping review of articles published from 31st December 2019 to 5th November 2020 in Pubmed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv databases, and a review of undergoing clinical trials published in the Clinicaltrial.gov database.

ResultsMany studies report on outpatient treatment with a combination of AZM + HCQ versus AZM alone, and few studies propose the addition of Zinc (Zn) to AZM. In addition, we identified 5 clinical trials currently recruiting individuals for early outpatient treatment with AZM. However, we failed in identifying any study or clinical trial conducted with family practitioners responding to our question.

DiscussionThe antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory benefits of AZM + Zn make this drugs combination a good candidate therapy to treat flu-like-COVID-19 and atypical pneumoniae. The antibacterial action of AZM can also help disrupting the bacteria/virus cooperation that is poorly documented. Considering pros and cons of macrolide use (including antimicrobial resistance), we call for early use of this therapy by family practitioners for home treatment of individuals presenting mild or moderate symptoms under rigorous scientific guidance to prevent hospitalisation, death and long-COVID.",Philippe LEPERE; Bruno Escarguel; Selda Yolartiran; Claude Escarguel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248975,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248975,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
76,"Postlockdown Dynamics of COVID-19 in New York, Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin","The COVID-19 pandemic is widely studied as it continues to threaten many populations of people especially in the USA, the leading country in terms of both deaths and cases. More and more reports show that the spread of COVID-19 involves infected individuals first passing through a pre-symptomatic infectious stage in addition to the incubation period and that many of the infectious individuals are asymptomatic. In this study, we design and use a mathematical model to primarily address the question of who are the main drivers of COVID-19 - the symptomatic infectious or the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious in the states of Florida, Arizona, New York, Wisconsin and the entire United States. We emphasize the benefit of lockdown by showing that for all four states, earlier and later lockdown dates decrease the number of cumulative deaths. This benefit of lockdown is also evidenced by the decrease in the infectious cases for Arizona and the entire US when lockdown is implemented earlier. When comparing the influence of the symptomatic infectious versus the presympomatic/asymptomatic infectious, it is shown that, in general, the larger contribution comes from the latter group. This is seen from several perspectives (1) in terms of daily cases, (2) in terms of daily cases when the influence of one group is targeted over the other by setting the effective contact rate(s) for the non-targeted group to zero, and (3) in terms of cumulative cases and deaths for the US and Arizona when the influence of one group is targeted over the other by setting the effective contact rate(s) for the non-targeted group to zero. The consequences of the difference in the contributions of the two infectious groups is simulated in terms of testing and these simulations show that an increase in testing and isolating for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group has more impact than an increase in testing for the symptomatic infectious. For example, for the entire US, a 50% increase in testing for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group results in a 35% decrease in deaths as opposed to a lower 6% decrease in deaths when a 50% increase in testing rate for the symptomatic infectious is implemented. We also see that if the testing for infectious symptomatic is kept at the baseline value and the testing for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic is increased from 0.2 to 0.25, then the control reproduction number falls well below 1. On the other hand, to get even close to such a result when keeping the presymptomatic and asymptomatic at baseline fitted values, the symptomatic infectious testing rate must be increased considerably more - from 0.25 to 1.7. Lastly, we use our model to simulate an implementation of a natural herd immunity strategy for the entire U.S. and for the state of Wisconsin (the most recent epicenter) and we find that such a strategy requires a significant number of deaths and as such is questionable in terms of success. We conclude with a brief summary of our results and some implications regarding COVID-19 control and mitigation strategies.",Shery Scott; Keisha Cook; Kamal Barley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248967,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248967,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
77,Global surveillance of potential antiviral drug resistance in SARS-CoV-2: proof of concept focussing on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have involved many repurposed drugs. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, encoded by nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) has been targeted by numerous inhibitors with debated clinical impact. Among these, remdesivir has been conditionally approved for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Although the emergence of antiviral resistance, an indirect proxy for antiviral efficacy, poses a considerable healthcare threat, an evolutionary perspective on emerging resistant mutants is still lacking.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is under purifying selection, that potential escape mutations are rare, and unlikely to lead to viral fitness loss.

In more than 56,000 viral genomes from 105 countries dating from December 2019 to July 2020 we found negative selective pressure affecting nsp12 (Tajimas D = -2.62), with potential antiviral escape mutations in only 0.3% of sequenced genomes. Those affected known key residues, such as Nsp12:Val473 and Nsp12:Arg555. Of the potential escape mutations found globally, in silico structural models show that this rarely implies loss of stability in RdRp. No potential escape mutation were found in our local cohort of remdesivir treated patients from the first wave (n=8). Our results indicate that RdRp is a suitable drug target, and that remdesivir does not seem to exert high selective pressure. Our study could be the starting point of a larger monitoring effort of drug resistance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend the application of repetitive genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from patients treated with antivirals to provide early insights into the evolution or antiviral resistance.",Alfredo Mari; Tim-Christoph Roloff; Madlen Stange; Kirstine Kobberoee Soegaard; Erblin Asllanaj; Gerardo Tauriello; Leila Tamara Alexander; Michael Schweitzer; Karoline Leuzinger; Alexander Gensch; Aurelien Martinez; Julia Bielicki; Hans Pargger; Martin Siegemund; Christian Nickel; Roland Bingisser; Michael Osthoff; Stefano Bassetti; Parham Sendi; Manuel Battegay; Catia Marzolini; Helena Seth-Smith; Torsten Schwede; Hans H.

78,Autoimmunity to the Lung Protective Phospholipid-Binding Protein Annexin A2 Predicts Mortality Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundAnnexin A2 is a phospholipid-binding protein involved in fibrinolysis, cell membrane stabilization and repair, and ensuring the integrity of the pulmonary microvasculature. Given the autoantibodies observed in COVID-19 and that Annexin A2 is a known target of antiphospholipid antibodies, we studied autoimmunity directed against Annexin A2 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe used ELISA to identify the levels of IgG autoantibodies recognizing Annexin A2 and A5 among 86 hospitalized cases of COVID-19. Using logistic regression, we analyzed the association between anti-Annexin A2 and A5 antibody levels with mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race and key comorbidities.

ResultsWe found higher average levels of anti-Annexin A2 antibodies among hospitalized COVID-19 patients that died when compared with non-critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.006) and critically ill COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.04). No significant differences in anti-Annexin A5 antibody levels were identified. Regression analysis showed that anti-Annexin A2 antibody levels as measured in relative units strongly predicted mortality with an odds ratio of 9.3 (95% CI: 1.9 to 44.6, p=0.005). In contrast, anti-Annexin A5 antibody levels were not associated with higher mortality (95% CI: 0.5 to 15.2, p=0.22).

ConclusionsWe determined that anti-Annexin A2 antibodies were elevated among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and these levels predicted mortality. It is known that inhibition of Annexin A2 induces systemic thrombosis, cell death, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Vaccine acceptance among the general public and the healthcare workers, appears to have a decisive role for successful control of the pandemic.

AimTo provide an up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates worldwide.

MethodsA systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on December 25, 2020. Results from 30 studies, met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Results of an additional recent survey from Jordan and Kuwait was considered in this review as well.

ResultsSurvey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). On the other hand, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). Only eight surveys among healthcare workers (doctors, nurses) were found, with vaccine acceptance rates ranging from 27.7% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 78.1% in Israel. In a majority of survey studies among the general public (62%), the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination showed a level of [&ge;] 70%.

ConclusionsLow rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were reported in the Middle East, Russia, Africa and several European countries. This could represent a major problem in the global efforts that aim to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. More studies are recommended to address the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Such studies are particularly needed in the Middle East Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle and Latin America.

81,SARS-CoV-2 Variant Under Investigation 202012/01 has more than twofold replicative advantage,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant Under Investigation VUI-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7), first collected on September 20, 2020, in Kent, is a rapidly growing lineage that in the first half of December 2020 constitutes more than 1/3 of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England. Based on GISAID data we have shown nearly exponential growth of the VUI-202012/01 to non-VUI-202012/01 genomes ratio in the five-week period since October 19 till November 22, 2020, with weekly growth rate of 2.31 [95% CI: 2.08-2.57]. Assuming the serial interval of 6.73 days we estimated the replicative advantage of VUI-202012/01 lineage as 2.316.73/7 = 2.24 [95% CI: 2.03-2.48]. Such significant replicative advantage and the fact that London serves as major international transportation hub suggest that the VUI-202012/01 strain will likely become globally dominant, hindering containment of the COVID-19 epidemics prior to massive vaccinations.",Frederic Grabowski; Grzegorz Preibisch; Marek Kochanczyk; Tomasz Lipniacki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248906,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248906,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
82,Primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic - observations and challenges identified through a survey and interviews with community paediatricians: the calm before the storm,"BackgroundGlobally, the COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact on healthcare provision. The effects in primary care are understudied.

AimTo document changes in consultation numbers and patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify challenges for patient care.

MethodsSurvey of 44 paediatric primary care practices on consultation numbers and patient management changes (response rate 50%), and semi-structured interviews to identify challenges for patient care.

ResultsNumbers of consultations for scheduled developmental examinations remained unchanged compared to the previous year while emergency visits were strongly reduced (mean 87.3 less/week in March-May 2020 compared to 2019, median reduction 55.0%). Children dependent on developmental therapy and with chronic health conditions were identified as patient groups receiving deteriorated care. High patient numbers, including of mildly symptomatic children presenting for health certificates, in combination with increased organisational demands and expected staff outages are priority concerns for the winter.

ConclusionPrimary care paediatricians offered stable service through the early pandemic but expect strained resources for the upcoming winter. Unambiguous guidance on which children should present to primary care and who should be tested would help to allocate resources appropriately, and this guidance needs to consider age group specific issues including high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, dependency on carers and high contact rates.",Malte Kohns Vasconcelos; Katharina Weil; Daniela Vesterling-Hoerner; Mehrsad Klemm; Tarik el Scheich; Hanna Renk; Katharina Remke; Hans Martin Bosse,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249037,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249037,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
83,Simple quantitative assessment of the outdoor versus indoor airborne transmission of viruses and covid-19,"In this paper we develop a simple model of the inhaled flow rate of aerosol particles of respiratory origin i.e. that have been exhaled by other humans. A connection is made between the exposure dose and the probability of developing an airborne disease. This allows a simple assessment of the outdoor versus indoor risk of contamination to be made in a variety of meteorological situations. It is shown quantitatively that for most cases, the outdoor risk is orders of magnitude less than the indoor risk and that it can become comparable only for extremely specific meteorological and geographical situations. It sheds a light on various observations of Covid-19 spreading in mountain valleys with temperature inversions while at the same time other areas are much less impacted.

ObjectWe evaluated GTC effects considering climate conditions and mobility. Method: We regressed R(t) on temperature, humidity, mobility, and countermeasures. Results: Estimation results indicate that temperature was a negative and significant influence; mobility was positive and significant. The emergency state and GTC were negative and significant.

86,Reliability of Google Trends: Analysis of the Limits and Potential of Web Infoveillance During COVID-19 Pandemic and for Future Research,"BackgroundAlongside the COVID-19 pandemic, government authorities around the world have had to face a growing infodemic capable of causing serious damages to public health and economy. In this context, the use of infoveillance tools has become a primary necessity.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to test the reliability of a widely used infoveillance tool which is Google Trends. In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs) quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected.

MethodsRSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1 - December 4, 2020 (period 1), and February 20 - May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December 8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling i the country, region, or city under investigation and j the day its RSV was collected, a Gaussian distribution [Formula] was used to represent the trend of daily variations of xij = RSVsij. When a missing value was revealed (anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Student t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical confident when t < 1.5. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20% (confidence threshold). The percentage increase{Delta} was used to quantify the difference between two values.

ResultsGoogle Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both period 1 and period 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases underwent significant variations even in these two datasets (Max |{Delta}| = + 625% for Italian regions, and Max |{Delta}| = +175% for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and international cities RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference.

ConclusionsIn the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries data for several consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established confidence threshold is respected.",Alessandro Rovetta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248969,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
87,Comparative Study - The Impact and Profile of COVID-19 Patients Who Are Indicated for Neuroimaging: Vascular Phenomena Are Been Found in the Brain and Olfactory Bulbs,"ObjectiveTo verify the impact and findings of the COVID-19 patients group that underwent brain scans in comparison to the group which only chest CT was performed.

Method876 suspected COVID-19 patients and a subsample of 232 cases with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent brain CT/MRI scan (n=35) or only chest CT (n=197) in two radiology departments, were evaluated.

Results5.59% of all suspected COVID-19 patients found had brain scans and 98.74% chest CT. There was a statistically significant difference with associations regarding the COVID-19 brain scan group for: admission to ICU, greater severity of lung injuries, the use of mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis, and stroke and statistical tendency for chronic renal failure and systemic arterial hypertension. 40.0% of COVID-19 patients from the brain scan group were abnormal on brain CT and/or brain MRI. 22.9% cases with any kind of bleeding or microbleeding, 8.6% with restricted diffusion lesions. One ischemic stroke case was associated with irregularity at M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. There was a case of left facial nerve palsy with enhancement of left geniculate ganglia. An analyse of the olfactory bulbs was possible in 12 brain MRIs and 100% had enhancement and/or microbleeding. There was no statistical difference regarding death (9.1% versus 5.2%).

In conclusionthe COVID-19 patients group on which brain CT and/or MRI needed to be performed was statically associated with the more severe COVID-19 disease, an indication to ICU, a more severe form of lung disease, use of mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis and stroke. Less than half of patients had abnormal brain imaging scans with all of them showing vascular brain injury lesion, being more frequently microbleeding or bleeding, followed by restricted diffusion lesions. All the olfactory bulbs evaluated showed injury by vascular phenomenon, probably methahemoglobine by microbleeding or microthrombus and/or abnormal enhancement",Maria de Fatima Viana Vasco Aragao; Mariana Carvalho Leal; Ocelio Queiroga Cartaxo Filho; Tatiana Moreira Fonseca; Lucas Vasco Aragao; Marcelo Andrade Valenca; Maria Regina Vendas Carneiro Leao; Pedro Henrique Pereira de Andrade Sr.; Joao Pedro Vasco Aragao; Silvio da Silva Caldas Neto; Marcelo Moraes Valenca,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248957,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248957,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
88,Lived experiences of pregnant and new mothers during COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative analysis of YouTube birth stories.,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought on unprecedented changes, not only to our daily lives but also to our healthcare system. The pandemic has particularly impacted pregnant women that must give birth with tight restrictions and significant uncertainties. Birth stories have frequently been used as a way for women to describe their experiences with the birthing process. In this uncertain time, birth stories can provide valuable insight into how pregnancy and birth stressors during a pandemic can impact the patients overall experience. This study sought to describe and understand pregnant and new mothers lived experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsResearchers extracted relevant YouTube birth stories using predetermined search terms and inclusion criteria. The mothers birth stories were narrated in their second or third trimester or those who had recently given birth during the study period. Birth stories were analyzed using an inductive and deductive approach to capture different aspects of the birthing experience.

ResultsOverall, eighty-three birth stories were analyzed. Within these birth stories, four broad themes and twelve subthemes emerged. Key themes included a sense of loss, hospital experiences, experiences with healthcare providers, and unique experiences during birth and postpartum. The birth stories revealed negative and positive birth experiences. Particularly, mothers were frustrated with constantly changing policies within the healthcare setting that negatively affected their birthing experience. On the other hand, support from healthcare professionals, having their partners in the delivery room, and having a positive mindset was instrumental in having a positive birth experience.

ConclusionResults from this study provided a detailed description of womens lived experience with giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare providers need to provide clear communication and compassionate patient-centered care to relieve womens anxiety about uncertain and unpredictable policy as the pandemic continues to evolve.",Kobi V Ajayi; Idethia S Harvey; Sonya Panjwani; Inyang Uwak; Whitney Garney; Robin L Page,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248958,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248958,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
89,An Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evaluation of Learned COVID-19 Concepts using Open-Source Word Embedding Sources,"IntroductionScientists are developing new computational methods and prediction models to better clinically understand COVID-19 prevalence, treatment efficacy, and patient outcomes. These efforts could be improved by leveraging documented, COVID-19-related symptoms, findings, and disorders from clinical text sources in the electronic health record. Word embeddings can identify terms related to these clinical concepts from both the biomedical and non-biomedical domains and are being shared with the open-source community at large. However, its unclear how useful openly-available word embeddings are for developing lexicons for COVID-19-related concepts.

ObjectiveGiven an initial lexicon of COVID-19-related terms, characterize the returned terms by similarity across various, open-source word embeddings and determine common semantic and syntactic patterns between the COVID-19 queried terms and returned terms specific to word embedding source.

Materials and MethodsWe compared 7 openly-available word embedding sources. Using a series of COVID-19-related terms for associated symptoms, findings, and disorders, we conducted an inter-annotator agreement study to determine how accurately the most semantically similar returned terms could be classified according to semantic types by three annotators. We conducted a qualitative study of COVID-19 queried terms and their returned terms to identify useful patterns for constructing lexicons. We demonstrated the utility of applying such terms to discharge summaries by reporting the proportion of patients identified by concept for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and COVID-19 cohorts.

ResultsWe observed high, pairwise inter-annotator agreement (Cohens Kappa) for symptoms (0.86 to 0.99), findings (0.93 to 0.99), and disorders (0.93 to 0.99). Word embedding sources generated based on characters tend to return more lexical variants and synonyms; in contrast, embeddings based on tokens more often return a variety of semantic types. Word embedding sources queried using an adjective phrase compared to a single term (e.g., dry cough vs. cough; muscle pain vs. pain) are more likely to return qualifiers of the same semantic type (e.g., ""dry"" returns consistency qualifiers like ""wet"", ""runny""). Terms for fever, cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia retrieved a higher proportion of patients than other clinical features. Terms for dry cough returned a higher proportion of COVID-19 patients than pneumonia and ARDS populations.

DiscussionWord embeddings are a valuable technology for learning terms, including synonyms. When leveraging openly-available word embedding sources, choices made for the construction of the word embeddings can significantly influence the phrases returned.",Soham Parikh; Anahita Davoudi; Shun Yu; Carolina Giraldo; Emily Schriver; Danielle Mowery,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20249005,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20249005,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
90,Efficiency of Artificial Intelligence in Detecting COVID-19 Pneumonia and Other Pneumonia Causes by Quantum Fourier Transform Method,"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan in December 2019 and has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, this deadly pandemic has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to detect positive cases as early as possible to prevent the further spread of this outbreak. Currently, the most widely used COVID-19 detection technique is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR is time-consuming to confirm infection in the patient. Because RT-PCR is less sensitive, it provides high false-negative results. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended as a solution to this problem by healthcare professionals because of its higher sensitivity for early and rapid diagnosis. In addition, radiation used in CT poses a serious threat to patients. In this study, we propose a CNN-based method to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other types of viral and bacterial pneumonia using low-dose CT images to reduce the radiation dose used in CT. In our study, we used a data set consisting of 7717 CT images of 350 patients that we collected from Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University Research Hospital. We used a CNN-based network that suppresses noise to remove interference from low-dose CT images. In the image preprocessing phase, we provided lung segmentation from CT images and applied quantum Fourier transform. By evaluating all possible variations of local knowledge at the same time with quantum Fourier transformation, the most informative spatial information was extracted. In CNN-based architecture, we used pre-trained ResNet50v2 as a feature extractor and fine-tune by training with our dataset. We visualized the efficiency of the ResNet50v2 network using the t-SNE method. We performed the classification process with a fully connected layer. We created a heat map using the GradCam technique to see where the model focuses on the images while classifying. In this experimental study, the results of 99.5%, 99.2%, 99.0%, 99.7%, and 99.1%, were obtained in the context of performance criteria such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and f1 score, respectively.

91,Evaluation of three rapid lateral flow antigen detection tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to high demand of diagnostic tools. Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed and many have received regulatory acceptance such as CE IVD or FDA markings. Their performance needs to be carefully assessed.

Materials and Methods158 positive and 40 negative retrospective samples collected in saline and analyzed by a laboratory-developed RT-PCR test were used to evaluate Sofia (Quidel), Standard Q (SD Biosensor), and Panbio (Abbott) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). A subset of the specimens was subjected to virus culture.

ResultsThe specificity of all RADTs was 100% and the sensitivity and percent agreement was 80% and 85% for Sofia, 81% and 85% for Standard Q, and 83% and 86% for Panbio, respectively. All three RADTs evaluated in this study reached a more than 90% sensitivity for samples with a high viral load as estimated from the low Ct values in the reference RT-PCR. Virus culture was successful in 80% of specimens with a Ct value <25.

ConclusionsAs expected, the RADTs were less sensitive than RT-PCR. However, they benefit from the speed and ease of testing, and lower price as compared to RT-PCR.

92,Development of Electrospun Nanofibrous Filters for Controlling Coronavirus Aerosols,"Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in spreading COVID-19. To protect public health, we designed and fabricated electrospun nanofibrous air filters that hold promise for applications in personal protective equipment and indoor environment. Due to ultrafine nanofibers ([~]300 nm), the electrospun air filters had a much smaller pore size compared to the surgical mask and cloth masks (a couple of microns versus tens to hundreds of microns). A coronavirus strain was used to generate aerosols for filtration efficiency tests, which can better represent SARS-CoV-2 than other agents used for aerosol generation in previous studies. The electrospun air filters showed excellent performance by capturing up to 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols, which outperformed many commercial face masks. In addition, since NaCl aerosols have been widely used in filtration tests, we compared the filtration efficiency obtained from the coronavirus aerosols and the NaCl aerosols. The NaCl aerosols were demonstrated as an eligible surrogate for the coronavirus aerosols in the filtration tests, when air filters and face masks with diverse pore sizes, morphologies, and efficiencies were used. Our work paves a new avenue for advancing air filtration by developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission. Moreover, the removal efficiency of the NaCl aerosols can be reasonably translated into understanding how air filters capture the coronavirus aerosols.

93,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, now designated Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC) by Public Health England, originated in the UK in late Summer to early Autumn 2020. We examine epidemiological evidence for this VOC having a transmission advantage from several perspectives. First, whole genome sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing provides an indication of changing prevalence of different genetic variants through time. Phylodynamic modelling additionally indicates that genetic diversity of this lineage has changed in a manner consistent with exponential growth. Second, we find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Third, we examine growth trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers at local area level across England, and show that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. Available SGTF data indicate a shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases.

Fourth, we assess the association of VOC frequency with independent estimates of the overall SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number through time. Finally, we fit a semi-mechanistic model directly to local VOC and non-VOC case incidence to estimate the reproduction numbers over time for each. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage, with the estimated difference in reproduction numbers between VOC and non-VOC ranging between 0.4 and 0.7, and the ratio of reproduction numbers varying between 1.4 and 1.8. We note that these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period where high levels of social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other transmission contexts therefore requires caution.",Erik Volz; Swapnil Mishra; Meera Chand; Jeffrey C Barrett; Robert Johnson; Lily Geidelberg; Wes R Hinsley; Daniel J Laydon; Gavin Dabrera; Áine O'Toole; Roberto Amato; Manon Ragonnet-Cronin; Ian Harrison; Ben Jackson; Cristina V Ariani; Olivia Boyd; Nick Loman; John T McCrone; Sonia Gonçalves; David Jorgensen; Richard Myers; Verity Hill; David K Jackson; Katy Gaythorpe; Natalie Groves; John Sillitoe; Dominic P Kwiatkowski; - COG-UK; Seth Flaxman; Oliver Ratman; Samir Bhatt; Susan Hopkins; Axel Gandy; Andrew Rambaut; Neil M Ferguson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249034,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249034,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
94,Is sickle cell disease a risk factor for severe COVID-19 : a multicenter national retrospective cohort,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an infectious disease which has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Growing evidence suggests that individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at higher risk of a more serious COVID-19 illness. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy which increases the susceptibility to infections and as a consequent has higher risks of morbidity and mortality.

The impact of COVID-19 on SCD patients could lead to further increase in disease severity and mortality. Studies that examine the effect of SCD on COVID-19 outcomes are lacking. This study aims to determine whether SCD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection in regards to the requirement of non-invasive ventilation/high flow nasal cannula (NIV/HFNC), mechanical intubation (MV) or death.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to four Ministry of Health COVID-19 treatment facilities in Bahrain during the period of 24, February 2020, to 31, July 2020. All SCD patients with COVID-19 were included and compared to randomly selected non-SCD patients with COVID-19. Data for the selected patients were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of SCD on the outcomes.

ResultsA total of 1,792 patients with COVID-19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV and one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non-SCD patients required NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV and death occurred in 58 (3.3%) patients. Upon adjusting for confounders, SCD had an odds ratio of 1.847 (95% CI: 0.39 - 8.83; p=0.442).

95,Early measurement of blood sST2 is a good predictor of death and poor outcomes in patients admitted for COVID-19 infection,"ImportanceAlthough several biomarkers have shown correlation to prognosis in COVID-19 patients, their clinical value is limited because of lack of specificity, suboptimal sensibility, or poor dynamic behavior.

ObjectiveIn search of better prognostic markers in COVID-19, we hypothesized that circulating soluble ST2 (sST2) could be associated to a worse outcome, prompted by our previous knowledge of sST2 involvement in heart failure-associated lung deterioration, and by mounting evidence favoring a role of IL-33/ST2 axis in the disease.

Design, Setting and participantsOne hundred and fifty-two patients admitted for confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in a prospective non-interventional, observational study carried out in a tertiary teaching center. Blood samples were drawn at admission, 48-72 hours later and at discharge. sST2 concentrations, and routine blood laboratory were analyzed.

Main outcomesPrimary end-points were admission at intensive care unit (ICU) and, mortality. Other outcomes were a need for high oxygen flow therapy (HOF) or increasing treatment at 48/72 hours.

ResultsMedian age was 57.5 years (SD: 12.8), 60.4% males. Ten per cent of patients (n=15) were derived to ICU and/or died during admission. The rest stayed hospitalized 8(IQR:6) days on average. About 34% (n=47), 38% (n=53) and 48.5% (n=66) needed HOF, up-titrate therapy or both, respectively.

Median (IQR) sST2 serum concentration (ng/mL) rose to 53.1(30.9) at admission, peaked at 48-72h (79.5[64]) and returned to admission levels at discharge (44.9[36.7]), remaining significantly elevated above healthy donor values (18.6[15.1]).

A concentration of sST2 above 58.9 ng/mL identified patients progressing to ICU admission or death. These results remained significant after multivariable analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of sST2 for the occurrence of end-points was 0.776 (p=0.001). Admission sST2 was higher in patients who needed up-tritate therapy.

Conclusions and relevanceIn patients admitted for COVID-19 infection, measurement of sST2 measurement early within 24h after at admission was able to identify patients at risk of severe complications or death.",MARTA SÁNCHEZ-MARTELES; JORGE RUBIO-GRACIA; NATACHA PEÑA-FRESNEDA; VANESA GARCÉS-HORNA; BORJA GRACIA-TELLO; LUIS MARTÍNEZ-LOSTAO; SILVIA CRESPO-AZNÁREZ; JUAN IGNACIO PÉREZ-CALVO; IGNACIO GIMÉNEZ-LÓPEZ,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248989,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248989,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
96,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the air from hospitals and closed rooms occupied by COVID-19 patients,"To understand air transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and risks for health care personnel and visitors to hospitals, we analyzed air samples collected from various enclosures in hospitals at Hyderabad and Mohali and performed closed room experiments with COVID-19 positive individuals. We collected 64 air samples from COVID and non-COVID areas of various hospitals and 17 samples from closed rooms occupied by COVID patients. 4 samples from COVID care areas were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with no obvious predilection towards ICU/non-ICU areas in the hospital samples. In the closed room experiments, where one or more COVID-19 patients spent a short duration of time, one sample - collected immediately after the departure of three symptomatic patients from the room - was positive. Our results indicate that the chance of picking up SARS-CoV-2 in the air is directly related to a number of COVID positive cases in the room, their symptomatic status, and the duration of exposure and that the demarcation of hospital areas into COVID and non-COVID areas is a successful strategy to prevent cross infections. In neutral environmental conditions, the virus does not seem to spread farther away from the patients, especially if they are asymptomatic, giving an objective evidence for the effectiveness of physical distancing in curbing the spread of the epidemic.",Shivranjani Moharir; Sharat Sharath Chandra; Arushi Goel; Bhuwaneshwar Thakur; Gurpreet Singh Bhalla; Dinesh Kumar; Digvijay Singh Naruka; Ashwani Kumar; Amit Tuli; Swathi Suravaram; Thrilok Chander Bingi; M Srinivas; Rajarao Mesipogu; Krishna Reddy; Sanjeev Khosla; Karthik Bharadwaj Tallapaka; Rakesh K Mishra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248890,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248890,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
97,"Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19: a prompt, feasible, and sensitive diagnostic tool for COVID-19 based on a 1,757-patient cohort (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis).","ImportanceIn the COVID-19 pandemic, a limiting barrier for more successful approaches to COVID-19 is the lack of appropriate timing for its diagnosis, during the viral replication stage, when antiviral approaches could demonstrate efficacy, precluding progression to severe stages. Three major reasons that hamper the diagnosis earlier in the disease are the unspecific and mild symptoms in the first stage, the cost- and time-limitations of the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and the insufficient sensitivity of this test as desired for screening purposes during the pandemic. More sensitive and earlier methods of COVID-19 detection should be considered as key for breakthrough changes in the disease course and response to specific therapeutic strategies. Our objective was to propose a clinical scoring for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis) that has been validated in a large population sample, aiming to encourage the management of patients with high pre-clinical likelihood of presenting COVID-19, at least during the pandemics, independent of a rtPCR-SARS-COV-2 test.

Materials and methodsThis is a compounded retrospective and prospective analysis of clinical data prospectively collected from the Pre-AndroCoV and AndroCov Trials that resulted in a clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis based on likelihood of presenting COVID-19 according to the number of symptoms, presence of anosmia, and known positive household contact, in a variety of combinations of scoring criteria, aiming to the detect scorings that provided the highest pre-test probability and accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and accuracy were calculated for subjects screened in two different periods and altogether, for females, males, and both, in a total of nine different scenarios, for combinations between one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia in subjects without known positive household contacts, and no symptoms, one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia or ageusia in subjects with known positive household contacts.

Results1,757 patients were screened for COVID-19. Among the multiple combinations, requiring two or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia for subjects without known contact and one or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia with known positive contacts presented the highest accuracy (80.4%), and higher pretest probability and accuracy than virtually all rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 commercially available kit tests.

ConclusionThe AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis was demonstrated to be a feasible, quick, inexpensive and sensitive diagnostic tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. A clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 should avoid delays and missed diagnosis, and reduce costs, and should therefore be recommended as a first-line option for COVID-19 diagnosis for public health policies, at least while SARS-CoV-2 is the prevailing circulating virus.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 sensitive, accurate, and feasible?

FindingsThe present analysis of a 1,757-subject cohort of the AndroCoV trials demonstrated that clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis can deliver a more sensitive and prompter diagnosis than the current gold-standard diagnostic method, rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, with an accuracy above 80%.

MeaningA clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 avoids missed diagnosis due to insufficient sensitivity or incorrect timing of the performance of rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, reduces costs, avoid delays on specific managements, and allows the testing of potentially effective antiviral therapeutic approaches that should work if administered in the early stage of COVID-19",Flavio A Cadegiani; John A McCoy; Carlos Gustavo Wambier; Andy Goren,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248803,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248803,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
98,PREDICTORS OF UPTAKE OF A POTENTIAL COVID-19 VACCINE AMONG NIGERIAN ADULTS,"BackgroundThe Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) pandemic is not abating and there is no approved treatment yet. The development of vaccines is hoped to help in addressing this disease outbreak. However, in the face of anti-vaccines uprise, it is important to understand the factors that may influence the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines as this will influence how successful the fight against COVID-19 will be in the long term.

MethodsA cross-sectional study among 776 adult Nigerians (age [&ge;]18 years) was conducted in the 36 States of Nigeria and the Capital City with online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 5 sections: socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, respondents knowledge of COVID-19, respondents risk perception of COVID-19, vaccination history of respondents, and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Descriptive analysis of variables was done and multivariate analysis using logistic regression was carried out to determine the predictors of uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The level of significance was predetermined at a p-value < 0.05. Data analysis was done with SPSS version 21.

ResultsMost of the respondents were male (58.1%). Most participants were willing to take a potential COVID-19 vaccine (58.2%), while 19.2% would not take it with 22.6% indecisive. 53.5% would prefer a single dose COVID-19 vaccine. For vaccine uptake, being male (p= 0.002) and the perception that ""vaccines are good"" (p< 0.001) were the positive predictor of uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionMost Nigerians were willing to take a potential COVID-19 vaccine with the male gender and perception that ""vaccines are good"" being positive predictors.

99,Insights into the molecular mechanism of anticancer drug ruxolitinib repurposable in COVID-19 therapy,"Due to non-availability of specific therapeutics against COVID-19, repurposing of approved drugs is a reasonable option. Cytokines imbalance in COVID-19 resembles cancer; exploration of anti-inflammatory agents, might reduce COVID-19 mortality. The current study investigates the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar cells compared to the uninfected one from the GSE5147507 dataset. The protein-protein interaction network, biological process and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes were studied using STRING App of the Cytoscape software and R programming tools. The present study indicated that ruxolitinib treatment elicited similar response equivalent to that of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected situation by inducing defense response in host against virus infection by RLR and NOD like receptor pathways. Further, the effect of ruxolitinib in SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly caused by significant suppression of IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 genes as well as inhibition of DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction of interferon-I and -II signalling.",Manisha Mandal; Shyamapada Mandal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248986,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248986,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
100,Imprecise assessment of mask use may obscure associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity,"Masks are effective measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, however, lack of a national mandate coupled with poor adherence has led to suboptimal levels of transmission reduction. Although data has suggested that mask adherence is high, few studies have captured details on how mask wearing changes with activities and how these behaviors are associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We recruited an online sample of 3,058 respondents from three US states (MD, FL, IL; n[~]1000/state) between September 16 - October 15, 2020. The median age of the sample was 47; 53% were female, 56% were white and 22% were working outside the home. Seventy three percent of the sample reported always wearing a mask indoors and outdoors based on local guidelines, however, 78% of participants who reported always wearing a mask reported taking their mask off when outside the home. While overall masking according to guidelines was not significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, sometimes, often or always removing a mask during activities were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (adjusted odds ratio for always vs never removing mask: 9.92; 95% CI: 1.16 - 85.1). These findings suggest that masks were most effective when worn without removal reflecting the need for consistent use.",Sophie Berube; Steven Clipman; Shruti H Mehta; Sunil Solomon; Amy Wesolowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249033,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249033,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
101,COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE),"Background and aimThe COVID-19 pandemic is putting extraordinary pressure on emergency departments (EDs). To support decision making about hospital admission, we aimed to develop a simple and valid model for predicting mortality and need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in suspected-COVID-19 patients presenting at the ED.

MethodsFor model development, we included patients that presented at the ED and were admitted to 4 large Dutch hospitals with suspected COVID-19 between March and August 2020, the first wave of the pandemic in the Netherlands. Based on prior literature we included patient characteristics, vital parameters and blood test values, all measured at ED admission, as potential predictors. Logistic regression analyses with post-hoc uniform shrinkage was used to obtain predicted probabilities of in-hospital death and of being admitted to the ICU, both within 28 days after admission. Model performance (AUC; calibration plots, intercepts and slopes) was assessed with temporal validation in patients who presented between September and December 2020 (second wave). We used multiple imputation to account for missing predictor values.

ResultsThe development data included 5,831 patients who presented at the ED and were hospitalized, of whom 629 (10.8%) died and 5,070 (86.9%) were discharged within 28 days after admission. A simple model - named COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE) - with linear age and logarithmic transforms of respiratory rate, CRP, LDH, albumin and urea captured most of the ability to predict death within 28 days. Patients who were admitted in the first month of the pandemic had substantially increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.99; 95% CI 1.61-2.47). COPE was well-calibrated and showed good discrimination for predicting death in 3,252 patients of the second wave (AUC in 4 hospitals: 0.82; 0.82; 0.79; 0.83). COPE was also able to identify patients at high risk of needing IC in second wave patients below the age of 70 (AUC 0.84; 0.81), but overestimated ICU admission for low-risk patients. The models are implemented as a web-based application.

ConclusionCOPE is a simple tool that is well able to predict mortality and ICU admission for patients who present to the ED with suspected COVID-19 and may help to inform patients and doctors when deciding on hospital admission.",David van Klaveren; Alexandros Rekkas; Jelmer Alsma; Rob JCG Verdonschot; Dick TJJ Koning; Marlijn JA Kamps; Tom Dormans; Robert Stassen; Sebastiaan Weijer; Klaas-Sierk Arnold; Marieke Roelink; Stephanie CE Schuit; Hester Lingsma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249023,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249023,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
102,Percentage of reported Covid-19 cases in Colombia: Estimating the true scale of the pandemic,"Since March 6, when Colombia confirmed its first case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the country healthcare system, with a limited testing capability, has struggled to monitor and report current cases. At the outbreak of a virus, data on cases is sparse and commonly severe cases, with a higher probability of a fatal resolution, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases. In addition, in an under-sampling situation, the number of total cases is under-estimated leading to a biased case fatality rate estimation, most likely inflating the virus mortality. Real time estimation of case fatality ratio can also be biased downwards by overlooking the delay between symptoms onset to death. In this communication, using reported data from Instituto Nacional de Salud up to December 28, we estimate the case fatality rate for Covid-19 in Colombia and some of its regions and cities adjusting for delay from onset to death. We then apply the method proposed by Russell et al. [1], and use our corrected case fatality rate to estimate the percentage of Covid-19 cases reported in Colombia as 42.95% (95% confidence interval: 42.50-43.41), which corresponds to a total of 3661,621 estimated Covid-19 cases in the country.",Nicolás Parra; Vladimir Vargas-Calderón; Juan Sebastián Flórez; Leonel Ardila; Carlos Viviescas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249052,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249052,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
103,Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza under vaccination scenarios,"The interaction and possibly interference between viruses infecting a common host population is the problem addressed in this work. We model two viral diseases both of the SIRS type that have similar mechanism of transmission and for which a vaccine exists. The vaccine is characterized by its coverage, induced temporal immunity and efficacy. The population dynamics of both diseases considers infected individuals of each disease and hosts that are susceptible to one but have recovered from the other. We do not incorporate coinfection. We postulate two main transmission factors affecting the effective contact rates: i) that the virus with higher reproduction number can superinfect the one with lower reproduction number and ii) that there is some protection induced by vaccination against the weaker virus that reduces the probability of infection by the stronger virus. Our results indicate that coexistence of the viruses is possible in the long term. The time-dependent effective contact rate may induce either alternating outbreaks of each disease or synchronous outbreaks. We also found the existence of bi-stability triggered by a backward bifurcation, conducive to scenarios where, at the population level, vaccine application may promote persistence of both diseases provided the effective coverage and vaccine efficacy are low.",Manuel Adrian Acuna Zegarra; Mayra Nunez Lopez; Mario Santana Cibrian; Andreu Comas Garcia; Jorge X.

104,Cardiometabolic risks of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization using Mendelian Randomization,"IntroMany cardiometabolic conditions have demonstrated associative evidence with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. However, the observational designs of the studies in which these associations are observed preclude causal inferences of hospitalization risk. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an alternative risk estimation method more robust to these limitations that allows for causal inferences.

Methods & materialsWe applied four MR methods (MRMix, IMRP, IVW, MREgger) to publicly available GWAS summary statistics from European (COVID-19 GWAS n=2,956) and multi-ethnic populations (COVID-19 GWAS n=10,808) to better understand extant causal associations between Type II Diabetes (GWAS n=659,316), BMI (n=681,275), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure (n=757,601 for each) and COVID-19 hospitalization risk across populations.

ResultsAlthough no significant causal effect evidence was observed, our data suggested a trend of increasing hospitalization risk for Type II diabetes (IMRP OR, 95% CI: 1.67, 0.96-2.92) and pulse pressure (OR, 95% CI: 1.27, 0.97-1.66) in the multi-ethnic sample.

ConclusionsType II diabetes and Pulse pressure demonstrates a potential causal association with COVID-19 hospitalization risk, the proper treatment of which may work to reduce the risk of a severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization.

105,Lockdown Effects on Sars-CoV-2 Transmission - The evidence from Northern Jutland,"The exact impact of lockdowns and other NPIs on Sars-CoV-2 transmission remain a matter of debate as early models assumed 100% susceptible homogenously transmitting populations, an assumption known to overestimate counterfactual transmission, and since most real epidemiological data are subject to massive confounding variables. Here, we analyse the unique case-controlled epidemiological dataset arising from the selective lockdown of parts of Northern Denmark, but not others, as a consequence of the spread of mink-related mutations in November 2020. Our analysis shows that while infection levels decreased, they did so before lockdown was effective, and infection numbers also decreased in neighbour municipalities without mandates. Direct spill-over to neighbour municipalities or the simultaneous mass testing do not explain this. Instead, control of infection pockets possibly together with voluntary social behaviour was apparently effective before the mandate, explaining why the infection decline occurred before and in both the mandated and non-mandated areas. The data suggest that efficient infection surveillance and voluntary compliance make full lockdowns unnecessary at least in some circumstances.",Kasper Planeta Kepp; Christian Bjornskov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248936,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248936,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
106,Unsupervised Discovery of Risk Profiles on Negative and Positive COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients,"COVID-19 is a viral disease that affects people in different ways: Most people will develop mild symptoms; others will require hospitalization, and a few others will die. Hence identifying risk factors is vital to assist physicians in the treatment decision. The objective of this paper is to determine whether unsupervised analysis of risk factors of positive and negative COVID-19 subjects may be useful for the discovery of a small set of reliable and clinically relevant risk-profiles. We selected 13367 positive and 19958 negative hospitalized patients from the Mexican Open Registry. Registry patients were described by 13 risk factors, three different outcomes, and COVID-19 test results. Hence, the dataset could be described by 6144 different risk-profiles per age group. To discover the most common risk-profiles, we propose the use of unsupervised learning. The data was split into discovery (70%) and validation (30%) sets. The discovery set was analyzed using the partition around medoids (PAM) method and robust consensus clustering was used to estimate the stable set of risk-profiles. We validated the reliability of the PAM models by predicting the risk-profile of the validation set subjects. The clinical relevance of the risk-profiles was evaluated on the validation set by characterizing the prevalence of the three patient outcomes: pneumonia diagnosis, ICU, or death. The analysis discovered six positives and five negative COVID-19 risk-profiles with strong statistical differences among them. Henceforth PAM clustering with consensus mapping is a viable method for unsupervised risk-profile discovery among subjects with critical respiratory health issues.",Fahimeh Nezhadmoghadam; Jose Tamez-Pena,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248908,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248908,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

It was shown during the first wave that mobility restrictions reduce significantly infection transmission. Here we document the reverse relationship by showing, between the first two Covid-19 waves, a high positive correlation between the trends of SARS-Cov-2 transmission and mobility. These two trends oscillate simultaneously and increased mobility following lockdown relaxation has a significant positive relationship with increased transmission.

108,The Silent Pandemic COVID -19 in the Asymptomatic Population,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world there is a great need to understand the dynamics of spread. Currently the seroprevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 doubles every 3 months, this silent epidemic of new infections may be the main driving force behind the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Public health official quickly recognized that clinical cases were just the tip of the iceberg. In fact a great deal of the spread was being driven by the asymptomatically infected who continued to go out, socialize and go to work. While seropositivity is an insensitive marker for acute infection it does tell us about the prevalence COVID-19 in the population.

ObjectiveDescribe the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States over time.

MethodologyRepeated convenience samples from a commercial laboratory dedicated to the assessment of life insurance applicants were tested for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, in several time periods between May and December of 2020. US census data were used to estimate the population prevalence of seropositivity.

ResultsThe raw seroprevalence in the May-June, September, and December timeframes were 3.0%, 6.6% and 10.4%, respectively. Higher rates were noted in younger vs. older age groups. Total estimated seroprevalence in the US is estimated at 25.7 million cases.

109,Characterizing Two Outbreak Waves of COVID-19 in Spain Using Phenomenological Epidemic Modelling,"Since the first case reported of SARS-CoV-2 the end of December 2019 in China, the number of cases quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend, demonstrating that a global pandemic is possible. As of December 3, 2020, the total number of cases reported are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000 deaths affecting 218 countries and territories. In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered in a hard way, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, namely COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step phenomenological epidemic approach. First, we use a simple generalized growth model to fit the main parameters at the early epidemic phase; later, we apply our previous finding over a logistic growth model to that characterize both waves completely.

110,Antemortem vs. postmortem histopathological and ultrastructural findings in paired transbronchial biopsies and lung autopsy samples from three patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Multiple autopsy-based reports of COVID-19 lung pathology describe diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), organizing pneumonia (OP) and fibrotic change, but data on early pathological changes as well as during progression of the disease are rare.

Research questionComparison of histopathological and ultrastructural findings in paired transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) and autopsy material from three patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled 3 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Full clinical evaluation was performed including high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT). We took TBBs at different time points during the disease and autopsy tissue samples after the patients death.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR and/or FISH in all TBBs. Lung histology revealed pneumocyte hyperplasia and capillary congestion in one patient who died short after hospital admission with detectable virus in 1/2 autopsy samples from the lung. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2/2 autopsy samples from a patient with a fulminant course of the disease and very short latency between biopsy and autopsy, both showing widespread DAD. In a third patient with a prolonged course, i.e. five weeks of ICU treatment with ECMO, autopsy samples showed extensive interstitial fibrosis without detectable virus by RT-PCR and/or FISH.

InterpretationWe report the course of COVID-19 in paired TBB and autopsy samples from three patients at an early stage, in rapidly progressive and in a prolonged disease course. Our findings illustrate vascular, organizing and fibrotic patterns of COVID-19-induced lung injury and suggest an early spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the upper airways to the lung periphery with diminishing viral load during disease.",Daniel Gagiannis; Vincent G Umathum; Wilhelm Bloch; Conn Rother; Marcel Stahl; Hanno M Witte; Sonja Djudjaj; Peter Boor; Konrad Steinestel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248929,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248929,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
111,"Respiratory and non-respiratory manifestations in children admitted with COVID 19 in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil","IntroductionCOVID 19 is still a challenge in pediatrics due to variety of symptoms and different presentations

AimTo describe clinical, laboratorial and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric admitted in hospitals.

MethodsA retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted between March and November 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Clinical data about symptoms, laboratorial exams and treatments were analysed. Patients were evaluated according predominant (PRS) or non-predominant respiratory symptoms (non-PRS)

ResultsSixty-four patients were evaluated, being the median age 5.6 years. Forty-seven (73.4%) children were admitted with PRS and 17 (26.4%) with non-PRS. The main symptoms in the PRS group were fever in 74.5% of children and cough in 66%; and fever in 76.5% and edema/cavitary effusion in 29.4% in the non-PRS group. The median of C-reactive protein (in mg/dl) was 2.5 in the PRS group and 6.1 in the non-PRS group. Antibiotics were used in 85.1% of the PRS group and 94.1% of non-group. Comorbidity was present in 30/47 (63.8%) of PRS group and 8/17 (47.1%) of non-PRS group (p=0.22). Length of stay until 7 days in patients with comorbidity was present in 27/64 (42.1%) and more than 7 days in 11/64 (17.1%) (p= 0.2)

ConclusionNon-PRS represented more than one quarter of admitted patients. Fever was the main symptom detected, elevated CRP was frequent and antibiotics were commonly prescribed.

112,Strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in classroom settings: Combined impacts of ventilation and mask effective filtration efficiency,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be significant and global. As the global community learns more about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is strong evidence that a significant modality of transmission is via the long-range airborne route, referred to here as aerosol transmission. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of ventilation, mask effective filtration efficiency, and the combined effect of the two on the reduction of aerosol infection probability for COVID-19 in a classroom setting. The Wells-Riley equation is used to predict the conditional probability of infection for three distinct airborne exposure scenarios: (1) an infectious instructor exposing susceptible students; (2) an infectious student exposing other susceptible students; and (3) an infectious student exposing a susceptible instructor. Field measurements were performed in a classroom using a polydisperse neutralized salt (NaCl) aerosol, generated in a size range consistent with human-generated SARS-CoV-2 containing bioaerosols, as a safe surrogate. Measurements included time-resolved and size-resolved NaCl aerosol concentration distributions and size-resolved effective filtration efficiency of different masks with and without mask fitters. The measurements were used to validate assumptions and inputs for the Wells-Riley model. Aerosol dynamics and distribution measurements confirmed that the majority of the classroom space is uniform in aerosol concentration within a factor of 2 or better for distances > 2 m from the aerosol source. Mask effective filtration efficiency measurements show that most masks fit poorly with estimated leakage rates typically > 50%, resulting in significantly reduced effective filtration efficiency. However, effective filtration efficiencies approaching the mask material filtration efficiency were achievable using simple mask fitters. Wells-Riley model results for the different scenarios suggest that ventilation of the classroom alone is not able to achieve infection probabilities less than 0.01 (1%) for air exchanges rates up to 10 h-1 and an event duration of one hour. The use of moderate to high effective filtration efficiency masks by all individuals present, on the other hand, was able to significantly reduce infection probability and could achieve reductions in infection probability by 5x, 10x, or even >100x dependent on the mask used and use of a mask fitter. This enables conditional infection probabilities < 0.001 (0.1%) or even < 0.0001 (0.01%) to be reached with the use of masks and mask fitters alone. Finally, the results demonstrate that the reductions provided by ventilation and masks are synergistic and multiplicative. The results reinforce the use of properly donned masks to achieve reduced aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases transmitted via respiratory aerosol indoors and provide new motivation to further improve the effective filtration efficiency of common face coverings through improved design, and/or the use of mask fitters.",David A Rothamer; Scott T Sanders; Douglas Reindl; Timothy H Bertram,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249101,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249101,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
113,Tele-Rehabilitation for People with Visual Disabilities During COVID-19 Pandemic: Lesson Learned,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 outbreak poses a global crisis in health care delivery system, including habilitation and rehabilitation services. In the present study, we shared our experiences on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD) amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs.

MethodsFollowing the lockdown declared on March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received information that many VCS were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was set-up for tele-facilities. The intended services was explained while disseminating the mobile numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the qualitative information.

ResultsAs of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team, with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis.

114,One Shot Model For The Prediction of COVID-19 and Lesions Segmentation In Chest CT Scans Through The Affinity Among Lesion Mask Features,"We introduce a model that segments lesions and predicts COVID-19 from chest CT scans through the derivation of an affinity matrix between lesion masks. The novelty of the methodology is based on the computation of the affinity between the lesion masks features extracted from the image. First, a batch of vectorized lesion masks is constructed. Then, the model learns the parameters of the affinity matrix that captures the relationship between features in each vector. Finally, the affinity is expressed as a single vector of pre-defined length. Without any complicated data manipulation, class balancing tricks, and using only a fraction of the training data, we achieve a 91.74% COVID-19 sensitivity, 85.35% common pneumonia sensitivity, 97.26% true negative rate and 91.94% F1-score.

115,Effect of public health interventions during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Cyprus: a modelling study,"BackgroundCyprus addressed the first wave of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. The aims of this study were: a) to estimate epidemiological parameters of this wave including infection attack ratio, infection fatality ratio, and case ascertainment ratio, b) to assess the impact of public health interventions, and c) to examine what would have happened if those interventions had not been implemented.

MethodsA dynamic, stochastic, individual-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model was developed to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression in the population of the Republic of Cyprus. The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use.

ResultsBy May 8 2020th, the infection attack ratio was 0.31% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 0.15%, 0.54%), the infection fatality ratio was 0.71% (95% CrI: 0.44%, 1.61%), and the case ascertainment ratio was 33.2% (95% CrI: 19.7%, 68.7%). If Cyprus had not implemented any public health measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 14th. The interventions averted 715 (95% CrI: 339, 1235) deaths. If Cyprus had only increased ICU beds, without any social distancing measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 19th.

116,"Real-World Clinical Performance of the Abbott Panbio with Nasopharyngeal, Throat and Saliva Swabs Among Symptomatic Individuals with COVID-19","BACKGROUNDPoint of Care Testing (POCT) SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests, such as the Abbott Panbio, have great potential to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The Panbio is United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the first 7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset(s).

METHODSSymptomatic adults recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the community were recruited into the study. Paired nasopharyngeal (NP), throat, and saliva swabs were collected, with one paired swab tested immediately with the Panbio, and the other transported in universal transport media and tested using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated. Subsequently, individuals within 7 days of symptom onset who presented to community assessment centres for SARS-CoV-2 testing had Panbio testing completed and paired with RT-PCR results from parallel NP or throat swabs.

RESULTS145 individuals were included in the study. Collection of throat and saliva was stopped early due to poor performance (throat PPA 57.7%, n=61, and saliva PPA 2.6%, n=41). NP swab PPA was 87.7% [n=145, 95% confidence interval 81.0% - 92.7%]. There were 1,641 symptomatic individuals tested by Panbio in community assessment centres, with 268/1641 (16.3%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. There were 37 false negatives, corresponding to a PPA of 86.2% [81.5% - 90.1%].

117,"Implications in the quantitation of SARS-CoV2 copies in concurrent nasopharyngeal swabs, whole mouth fluid and respiratory droplets","ImportanceThe nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) is considered the ideal diagnostic specimen for Covid-19, while WMF is recently promoted due to collection simplicity and importance in disease transmission. There is limited knowledge on the relative viral load in these samples - NPS, whole mouth fluid (WMF) and respiratory droplets (RD; another important source in transmission), on how the loads vary with disease severity and on how much virus is shed.

ObjectiveTo quantify and compare SARS-CoV2 copies in the NPS, WMF and RD samples, and correlate with disease severity.

DesignCross sectional study.

SettingTertiary care multi-speciality hospital with limited resources in a low-to-middle income country.

ParticipantsEighty suspected COVID-19 patients were recruited from the COVID-19 out-patient clinic and hospital isolation wards.

InterventionConcurrent NPS, WMF and RD samples were collected from all the recruited patients and tested for SARS-CoV2 copies by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Main outcomes and measuresThe main outcome was COVID-19 measured by SARS-CoV2 quantitative RT-PCR in NPS samples. COVID-19 disease severity was determined according to NIH criteria. Virus shedding was defined as the presence of SARS-CoV2 copies in the WMF and RD samples.

ResultsSARS-CoV2 was detected in 55/80 (69%) of the NPS samples. Of these 55, WMF and RD samples were positive in 44 (80%) and 17 (31%), respectively. The concordance of WMF with NPS was 84% (p=0.02). SARS-CoV2 copy numbers were comparable in the NPS (median: 8.74x10^5) and WMF (median: 3.07x10^4), but lower in RD samples (median: 3.60x10^2). Patients with mild disease had higher copies in the NPS (median: 3.46x10^6), while patients with severe disease had higher copies in the WMF (median: 1.34x10^6) and RD samples (median: 4.29x10^4). The 25-75% interquartile range of NPS SARS-CoV2 copies was significantly higher in the WMF (p=0.0001) and RD (p=0.01) positive patients.

Conclusion and relevanceSARS-CoV2 copies are highest in NPS samples. WMF is a reliable surrogate sample for diagnosis. High copy numbers in the NPS imply initial virological phase and higher risk of virus shedding via WMF and RD.

119,"The Joint Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality: An Agent-Based Simulation","BackgroundVaccination against SAR-CoV-2 has the potential to significantly reduce transmission and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. This modeling study simulated the comparative and joint impact of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on total infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.

MethodsAn agent-based simulation model was employed to estimate incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths over 1.5 years for the State of North Carolina, a population of roughly 10.5 million. Vaccine efficacy of 50% and 90% and vaccine coverage of 25%, 50%, and 75% (at the end of a 6-month distribution period) were evaluated. Six vaccination scenarios were simulated with NPIs (i.e., reduced mobility, school closings, face mask usage) maintained and removed during the period of vaccine distribution.

ResultsIn the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy and 25% coverage), approximately 2.2 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred with NPIs removed and approximately 900,000 infections with NPIs maintained. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy and 75% coverage), there were 458,087 new infections with NPIs maintained and 535,019 with NPIs maintained. When NPIs were removed, 50% efficacy and 75% coverage reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than 90% efficacy and 25% coverage (absolute risk reduction 13% and 8%, respectively).

ConclusionSimulation results suggest that, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SAR-CoV-2 infection than compared to more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. Furthermore, premature lifting of NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Overall, our findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs to end the current pandemic.",Mehul D Patel; Erik Rosenstrom; Julie S Ivy; Maria E Mayorga; Pinar Keskinocak; Ross M Boyce; Kristen Hassmiller Lich; Raymond L Smith; Karl T Johnson; Julie L Swann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248888,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248888,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
120,"THE INFLUENCE OF HLA GENOTYPE ON SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, AND SEVERITY OF, COVID-19 INFECTION","BackgroundThe impact of COVID-19 varies markedly, not only between individual patients but also between different populations. We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation.

MethodsUsing next generation sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA genes of 147 white British patients with variable clinical outcomes. 49 of these patients were admitted to hospital with severe COVID infection. They had no significant pre-existing comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a group of 69 asymptomatic hospital workers who evidence of COVID exposure based on blood antibody testing. Allelic frequencies in both the severe and asymptomatic groups were compared to local and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n=13) or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n=16), we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the presence of specific HLA genes on symptomatology.

FindingsWe found a significant difference in the allelic frequency of HLA-DRB1*04:01 in the severe patient compared to the asymptomatic staff group (5.1% versus 16.7%, p=0.003 after adjustment for age and sex). There was a significantly lower frequency of the haplotype DQA1*01:01/DQB1*05:01/DRB1*01:01 in the asymptomatic group compared to the background population (p=0.007). Ordinal logistic regression modelling confirmed the significant influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID-19 observed in the cohorts.

InterpretationThis study provides evidence that patient age, sex, BMI and HLA genotype interact to determine the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSHLA genes are implicated in host resistance or susceptibility to a range of pathogens. No studies thus far have compared HLA allele frequencies in patients requiring hospital admission following COVID-19 exposure to a group of asymptomatic individuals.

Added value of this studyThe results indicate that the presence of HLA-DRB1*04:01 might confer protection from the development of respiratory failure following exposure to COVID. Individuals remaining asymptomatic following exposure to COVID are less likely to carry the haplotype DQA1*01:01/DQB1*05:01/DRB1*01:01 compared to the background population. This may indicate a host defence pathway not primarily dependent on an IgG response for clearance of infection. These findings conflict with larger genome wide association studies which compared HLA allelic frequencies of severely unwell patients with the background population.

121,Analysis of the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in Berlin towards an universal prognostic relationship,"The present work is a continuation and development of research on prediction and analysis of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The proposed model adequately describes the development of the coronavirus epidemic with insufficient adherence to quarantine and social distancing. The transition from the absolute number of infected persons to their relative number per inhabitant of a settlement makes it possible to obtain universal calculation ratios.

In performing the calculations, the choice of the date of the beginning of the epidemic is of great importance. Recommendations are given on how to determine the date of the beginning of the epidemic based on the analysis of statistical data on the spread of the epidemic. The coefficient of virus transmission rate k included in the calculated prognostic relation depends on the population size and the type of virus strain in the settlement in question. A simple ratio for calculating this coefficient as a function of population size is proposed.

Control calculations performed using only a single empirical coefficient showed high accuracy. The calculated curves for Germany, Berlin, and its districts agree well with the corresponding statistical data. The correlation coefficients between the corresponding curves reach values of 0.93 to 0.97. The further development of the model should thus go in the direction of identifying causal links between the intensity of the epidemic and the main factors affecting this process. Some of these factors are related to the characteristics of the populations behaviour and the infrastructure of cities. The increase in the incidence in areas with a large percentage of the population rooted in Islamic countries is one of the main factors determining the development of the epidemic in Berlin. In order to explain and clarify this conclusion, it is necessary to make further assumptions about the possible emergence of a new strain of coronavirus in Berlin and in Germany and, accordingly, about the possibility of new epidemic waves. A preliminary ratio for predicting the spread of the epidemic under conditions of simultaneous existence of both strains of coronavirus is given.

Simplicity of the proposed prognostic method and high accuracy of the results allow to recommend it as an effective tool for operative analysis of various measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19 epidemic including mass vaccination of population.",Denis Below; Jana Mairanowski; Felix Mairanowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249117,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249117,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

ExposureExamined potential risk factors included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes included COVID-19-related hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality, which were identified from the electronic health records from MM.

ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 53,853 patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at MM, with mean (SD) age of 44.8 (23.1), mean (SD) BMI of 29.1 (7.6), and 23,814 (44.2%) males. Among the 2,582 patients who tested positive, 719 (27.8%) were hospitalized, 377 (14.6%) were admitted to ICU, and 129 (5.0%) died. The overall COVID-positive hospitalization rate decreased from 41.5% in Q1 to 12.6% in Q3, and the overall ICU admission rate decreased from 24.5% to 5.3%. Black patients had significantly higher (unadjusted) overall hospitalization rate (265 [41.1%] vs 326 [23.2%]), ICU admission rate (139 [21.6%] vs 172 [12.2%]), and mortality rate (42 [6.5%] vs 56 [4.0%]) than White patients. Each quarter, the hospitalization rate remained higher for Black patients compared to White patients, but this difference was attenuated over time for the (unadjusted) odds ratios (Q1: OR=1.9, 95% CI [1.25, 2.90]; Q2: OR=1.42, 95% CI [1.02, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.36, 95% CI [0.67, 2.65]). Similar decreasing patterns were observed for ICU admission and mortality. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, the racial disparities in hospitalization between White and Black patients were not significant in each quarter of the year (Q1: OR=1.43, 95% CI [0.75, 2.71]; Q2: OR=1.25, 95% CI [0.79, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.76 95% CI [0.81, 3.85]), in contrast to what was observed in the full cohort (OR=1.85, 95% CI [1.39, 2.47]). Additionally, significant association of hospitalization with living in densely populated area was identified in the first quarter (OR= 664, 95% CI [20.4, 21600]), but such association disappeared in the second and third quarters (Q2: OR= 1.72 95% CI [0.22, 13.5]; Q3: OR=3.69, 95% CI [0.103, 132]). Underlying liver diseases were positively associated with hospitalization in White patients (OR=1.60, 95% CI [1.01, 2.55], P=.046), but not in Black patients (OR=0.49, 95% CI [0.23, 1.06], P=.072, Pint=.013). Similar results were obtained for the effect of liver diseases on ICU admission in White and Black patients (White: OR=1.75, 95% CI [1.01, 3.05], P=.047; Black: OR=0.46, 95% CI [0.17, 1.26], P=.130, Pint=.030).

Conclusions and RelevanceThese findings suggest that the COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality rates were decreasing over the course of the pandemic. Although racial disparities persisted, the magnitude of the differences in hospitalization and ICU admission rates diminished over time.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionsC_ST_ABSHow did the overall hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates change over the course of the pandemic and how did they vary by race?

FindingsIn this cohort study of 2,582 patients testing positive for COVID-19, the unadjusted hospitalization rate decreased from 50.5% in Q1 (March 10, 2020, to March 31, 2020) to 17.9% in Q3 (July 1, 2020, to September 2, 2020) for Black patients, and from 23.2% in Q1 to 13.8% in Q3 for White patients. After adjusting for age, sex, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidity conditions, the odds ratios of hospitalization between White and Black patients were not significant in each quarter of the year 2020. No significant associations between ICU admission and race/ethnic groups were identified in each quarter or the entire three quarters.

MeaningThese findings suggests an appreciable decline in hospitalization and ICU admission rates among COVID-19 positive patients. The hospitalization and ICU admission rates across race/ethnic groups became closer over time.",Youfei Yu; Tian Gu; Thomas S. Valley; Lars G.

123,Diagnostic performance and clinical implications of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing in Mexico using real-world nationwide COVID-19 registry data,"BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2 testing capacity is important to monitor epidemic dynamics. Given difficulties of large-scale RT-PCR implementation, rapid antigen tests (Rapid Ag-T) have been proposed as alternatives in settings such as Mexico.

OBJECTIVESTo evaluate diagnostic performance of Rapid Ag-T for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated clinical implications compared to RT-PCR testing in Mexico.

METHODSWe analyzed data from the COVID-19 registry of the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology up to December 31st, 2020 (n=3,374,165) and cases with both RT-PCR and Rapid Ag-T (n=18,446). We evaluated diagnostic performance using accuracy measures and assessed time-dependent changes in AUROC. We also explored test discordances as predictors of hospitalization, intubation, severe COVID-19 and mortality.

RESULTSRapid Ag-T is primarily used in Mexico City. Rapid Ag-T have low sensitivity 37.6% (95%CI 36.6-38.7), high specificity 95.4% (95%CI 95.1-95.8) and acceptable positive 86.1% (95%CI 85.0-86.6) and negative predictive values 67.2% (95%CI 66.2-69.2). Rapid Ag-T has optimal diagnostic performance up to days 7-10 after symptom, and its performance is modified by testing location, comorbidity, and age. RT-PCR(-) / Rapid Ag-T(+) cases had higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes and were older, RT-PCR(+)/ Rapid Ag-T(-) cases had slightly higher risk or adverse outcomes and [&ge;]7 days from symptom onset. Cases detected with rapid Ag-T were younger, without comorbidities, and milder COVID-19 course.

CONCLUSIONSRapid Ag-T could be used as an alternative to RT-PCR for large scale SARS-CoV-2 testing in Mexico. Interpretation of Rapid Ag-T results should be done with caution to minimize the risk associated with false negative results.",Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla; Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa; Luisa Fernández-Chirino; Enrique C.

124,Can Catastrophe Theory explain expansion and contagious of Covid-19?,"Since SARS-Cov-2 started spreading in China and turned into a pandemic disease called Covid-19, many articles about prediction with mathematical model have appeared in the literature. In addition to models in specialized journals, a significant amount of software was made available, presenting with dashboards spreading of the pandemic for each new. These models are solved by computer simulation of traditional exponential models as a representation of the growth of cases and deaths. Some more accurate models are based on existing variations of SIR model (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered). A third class of study is developed in spatial or probabilistic models as a way of forecasting the effect of Covid-19 around the world. Data on the number of positive cases in all countries, show that SARS-Cov-2 shows great resistance even after strategies of lockdown or social distancing. The purpose of this article is to show how the bifurcation theory, known as Catastrophe Theory, can help to understand why Covid-19 expansion rates change so much and even with low values for a longtime trigger contagion quickly and abruptly.

The Catastrophe Theory was conceived by the mathematician Rene Thom in the 60s with wide applications in works in the 70s. The outbreak of spruce budworm in Canada revealed a very interesting opportunity to test Catastrophe Theory whose explanation for the phenomenon was widely debated in the academic world. Inspired by the same mathematical approach to this phenomenon in Canada in the 1970s, we applied the Catastrophe Theory in the current Covid-19 pandemic. We observed that sudden outbreaks occur when the carrying capacity and the rate of expansion of the virus reach a region of bifurcation on the cusp surface. With actual Covid-19 data obtained from WHO, we fitted the dynamic model using the particle swarm technique and compared the results in the bifurcation plan with the Covid-19 outbreaks in different regions of the world. It is possible in many cases to observe the trajectory of the parameters between limit points in the bistable region and the consequent explosion of cases observed for each country assessed.",Marco A L Caetano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249133,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249133,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
125,"Survival analysis of all critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the main hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, 30 March to 12 June 2020: what interventions are proving effective?","OBJECTIVESTo determine risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the main public sector hospital in Somalia and identify interventions contributing to improved clinical outcome in a low-resource and fragile setting.

SETTINGMain public sector tertiary hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia.

PARTICIPANTSAll 131 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the main public tertiary hospital in Somalia between 30 March and 12 June 2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESWe extracted demographic and clinical data from hospital records of all 131 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital until their death or recovery. We used Kaplan-Meier statistics to estimate survival probabilities and the log-rank test to assess significant differences in survival between groups. We used the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate likelihood of death and assess the effect of risk factors on survival.

RESULTSOf the 131 patients, 52 (40%) died in the hospital and 79 (60%) survived to discharge. The factors independently associated with increased risk of in-hospital death were: age [&ge;] 60 years - survival probability on day 21 in patients < 60 years was 0.789 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.658-0.874) compared with 0.339 (95% CI: 0.205-0.478) in patients [&ge;] 60 years; cardiovascular disease (survival probability 0.478 (95% CI: 0.332-0.610) in patients with cardiovascular disease compared with 0.719 (95% CI: 0.601-0.807) in patients without cardiovascular disease); and non-invasive ventilation on admission - patients who were not ventilated were significantly more likely to survive than those who were (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONOur study, which includes the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to a single hospital in a sub-Saharan African country, confirms that underlying conditions and age are associated with increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. Our results show the advantage of medical oxygen over non-invasive ventilation in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms.",Mohamed M Ali; Mamunur Rahman Malik; Abdulrazaq Yusuf Ahmed; Ahmed Mohamed Bashir; Abdulmunim Mohamed; Abdulkadir Abdi; Majdouline Obtel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.20248966,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.20248966,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
126,Implementing Building-Level SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance on a University Campus,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a source of ongoing challenges and presents an increased risk of illness in group environments, including jails, long term care facilities, schools, and, of course, residential college campuses. Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the universitys fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with total resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.",Cynthia J Gibas; Kevin Lambirth; Neha Mittal; Md Ariful Islam Juel; Visva Bharati Barua; Lauren Roppolo Brazell; Keshawn Hinton; Jordan Lontai; Nicholas Stark; Isaiah Young; Cristine Quach; Morgan Russ; Jacob Kauer; Bridgette Nicolosi; Srinivas Akella; Wenwu Tang; Don Chen; Jessica Schlueter; Mariya Munir,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20248843,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20248843,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
127,"Stages of COVID-19 pandemic and paths to herd immunity by vaccination: dynamical model comparing Austria, Luxembourg and Sweden","BackgroundWorldwide more than 72 million people have been infected and 1.6 million died with SARS-CoV-2 by 15th December 2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions which decrease social interaction have been implemented to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to mitigate stress on healthcare systems and prevent deaths. The pandemic has been tackled with disparate strategies by distinct countries resulting in different epidemic dynamics. However, with vaccines now becoming available, the current urgent open question is how the interplay between vaccination strategies and social interaction will shape the pandemic in the next months.

MethodsTo address this question, we developed an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model including social interaction, undetected cases and the progression of patients trough hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) and death. We calibrated our model to data of Luxem-bourg, Austria and Sweden, until 15th December 2020. We incorporated the effect of vaccination to investigate under which conditions herd immunity would be achievable in 2021.

ResultsThe model reveals that Sweden has the highest fraction of undetected cases, Luxembourg displays the highest fraction of infected population, and all three countries are far from herd immunity as of December 2020. The model quantifies the level of social interactions, and allows to assess the level which would keep Reff (t) below 1. In December 2020, this level is around 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic for all the three countries. The model allows to estimate the vaccination rate needed for herd immunity and shows that 2700 vaccinations/day are needed in Luxembourg to reach it by mid of April and 45,000 for Austria and Sweden. The model estimates that vaccinating the whole countrys population within 1 year could lead to herd immunity by July in Luxembourg and by August in Austria and Sweden.

ConclusionThe model allows to shed light on the dynamics of the epidemics in different waves and countries. Our results emphasize that vaccination will help considerably but not immediately and therefore social measures will remain important for several months before they can be fully alleviated.",Francoise Kemp; Daniele Proverbio; Atte Aalto; Laurent Mombaerts; Aymeric Fouquier d Herouel; Andreas Husch; Christophe Ley; Jorge Goncalves; Alexander Skupin; Stefano Magni,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249088,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249088,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
128,Need of care in interpreting Google Trends-based COVID-19 infodemiological study results: potential risk of false-positivity,"ObjectiveGoogle Trends (GT) is being used as an epidemiological tool to study coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by identifying keywords in search trends that are predictive for the COVID-19 epidemiological burden. However, many of the earlier GT-based studies include potential statistical fallacies by measuring the correlation between non-stationary time sequences without adjusting for multiple comparisons or the confounding of media coverage, leading to concerns about the increased risk of obtaining false-positive results. In this study, we aimed to apply statistically more favorable methods to validate the earlier GT-based COVID-19 study results.

MethodsWe extracted the relative GT search volume for keywords associated with COVID-19 symptoms, and evaluated their Granger-causality to weekly COVID-19 positivity in eight English-speaking countries and Japan. In addition, the impact of media coverage on keywords with significant Granger-causality was further evaluated using Japanese regional data.

ResultsOur Granger causality-based approach largely decreased (by up to approximately one-third) the number of keywords identified as having a significant temporal relationship with the COVID-19 trend when compared to those identified by the Pearson correlation-based approach. ""Sense of smell"" and ""loss of smell"" were the most reliable GT keywords across all the evaluated countries; however, when adjusted with their media coverage, these keyword trends did not Granger-cause the COVID-19 positivity trends (in Japan).

ConclusionOur results suggest that some of the search keywords reported as candidate predictive measures in earlier GT-based COVID-19 studies may potentially be unreliable; therefore, caution is necessary when interpreting published GT-based study results.",Kenichiro Sato; Tatsuo Mano; Atsushi Iwata; Tatsushi Toda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249066,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249066,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
129,Divergences on expected pneumonia cases during the COVID-19 epidemic in Catalonia: A time-series analysis of primary care electronic health records covering about 6 million people.,"BackgroundPneumonia is one of the complications of COVID-19. Primary care electronic health records (EHR) have shown the utility as a surveillance system.

AimTo analyze the trends of pneumonia during two waves of COVID-19 pandemic in order to use it as a clinical surveillance system and an early indicator of severity.

MethodsTime series analysis of pneumonia cases, January 2014-December 2020. We collected pneumonia diagnoses from primary care EHR, covering >6 million people in Catalonia (Spain). We compared the trend of pneumonia in the season 2019-2020 with that in the previous years. We estimated the expected pneumonia cases with data from 2014 to 2018 using a time series regression adjusted by seasonality and influenza epidemics.

ResultsBetween 4 March and 5 May 2020, 11,704 excess pneumonia cases (95% CI: 9,909 to 13,498) were identified. We observed a second excess pneumonia period from 22 october to 15 november of 1,377 excess cases (95% CI: 665 to 2,089). In contrast, we observed two great periods with reductions of pneumonia cases in children, accounting for 131 days and 3,534 less pneumonia cases (95% CI: 1,005 to 6,064) from March to July; and 54 days and 1,960 less pneumonia cases (95% CI 917 to 3,002) from October to December.

This is may be partly because of the absence of a recognized treatment for the disease, however, the prevalence and nature differ from country to country which may influence human behavioural responses.

AimThis study aimed to investigated the beharioural response of the community towards self- medication practices during this COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.

MethodsA cross sectional household and online survey was conducted during the months of June-to- August. The study was conducted among adult between age 18 above in communities of western Uganda who consented to participate in the study. Study participants were selected using a convenience sampling technique and sampling was done by sending a structured online questionnaire via Google forms and a printed copies questionnaire made available to other participants that did not use the online questionnaire

ResultsThe percentage of respondents that know about self-medication is (97%) and those that practice self-medication are approximately (88%). 97% of respondents have heard about self-medication either through health workers, media, family members, friends and/or school while 3% said they have not heard about self-medication. The percentage of respondents who practiced self- medication during COVID-19 pandemic is 57% while those that did not is 43%. There is statistically difference in the number of those that practice self-medication and those that do not p < 0.005 at 95% confidence interval. Also there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of respondents that practice self-medication during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compare to the practice before the pandemic lockdown p < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval.

131,"Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 among healthcare workers in public health facilities, Eastern Ethiopia","On 13 March 2020, Ethiopia reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa. COVID-19 is likely to overwhelm an already fragile health-care delivery system and reduce the availability of services for endemic health concerns such as malaria and diarrheal diseases.

Cross sectional study was conducted on heath care workers in three public health facilities in Somali region to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19. T-test and ANOVA were used to analyze the relationship between the dependent, and independent variables. Spearmans correlation was used to assess the relationship between mean knowledge and attitude scores.

A vast majority of the participants were male (n = 293, 67.5%), with a mean age of 27.6 (SD: 5.3) years. The mean knowledge score was 13.7 (SD: 2.6) and the mean attitude score 10.5 (SD: 4.1). Only 45.2 % (n = 196) of the participants had a good attitude toward COVID-19. There was a negative correlation between knowledge scores, attitude scores (r=-0.295, P<0.001) and practice (r=-0.298, P<0.001).

132,Do school closures reduce community transmission of COVID-19? A systematic review of observational studies,"IntroductionSchool closures are associated with significant negative consequences and may exacerbate inequalities. They were implemented worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2 in the first half of 2020, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This review summarises the empirical evidence of their effect on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.

MethodsThe study protocol was registered on Prospero (ID:CRD42020213699). On 12 October 2020 we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database, ERIC, the British Education Index, and the Australian Education Index. We included empirical studies with quantitative estimates of the effect of school closures/reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. We excluded prospective modelling studies and intra-school transmission studies. We performed a narrative synthesis due to data heterogeneity.

ResultsWe identified 3,318 articles, of which ten were included, with data from 146 countries. All studies assessed school closures, and one additionally examined re-openings. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Three studies, including the two at lowest risk of bias, reported no impact of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission; whilst the other seven reported protective effects. Effect sizes ranged from no association to substantial and important reductions in community transmission.

DiscussionStudies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological interventions implemented close to school closures. Our results are consistent with school closures being ineffective to very effective. This variation may be attributable to differences in study design or real differences. With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing school closures.

Panel:  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA previous systematic review, published by some of us in April 2020, found good evidence that school closures are effective for the control of influenza, but limited evidence of effectiveness for coronavirus outbreaks. At the time there was no available empirial evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Added value of this studyThis study is the first systematic review of the empirical evidence from observational studies of the effect of school closures and reopenings on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We include 10 studies, covering 146 countries. There was significant heterogeneity between studies. Some studies reported large reductions in incidence and mortality associated with school closures, however, studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity, and studies at lower risk of bias reported no association.

133,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Health Care Workers in the United States,"BackgroundAcceptance of any COVID-19 vaccine is an important challenge to address and will play a major role in combating the pandemic. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are amongst the first group to receive vaccination, so it is important to consider their attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance.

MethodsWe conducted a cross sectional study to assess the attitude of HCWs toward COVID-19 vaccination. Data was collected between October 7th and November 9th, 2020. We received 4080 responses out of which 3479 were complete responses and were included in final analysis.

Results36% of respondents were willing to take the vaccine as soon as it became available while 56% were not sure or would wait to review more data. Vaccine acceptance increased with increasing age, education, and income level. Lower acceptance was noted in females (31%), Black (10%), Hispanic (30%) and conservative/republican (21%) HCWs, and those working in a rural setting (26%). In the multinomial regression model, direct medical care providers and those with heart disease and cancer had lower likelihood of waiting to review than accepting vaccines. Safety (69%), effectiveness (69%) and rapidity of development/approval (74%) were noted as most common concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine in our survey.

ConclusionAcceptance of COVID-19 vaccine is low, with the majority of healthcare workers choosing to wait to review more data before deciding. Overall attitude toward vaccination was positive but specific concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine are prevalent. Differences in vaccine acceptance were noted along lines of social determinants of health which should be addressed to avoid magnifying health disparities.",Rahul Shekhar; Abu Baker Sheikh; Shubhra Upadhyay; Mriganka Singh; Saket Kottewar; Hamza Mir; Eileen Barrett; Suman Pal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249184,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249184,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
134,Spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks in South Carolina: A time series forecasting analysis,"ImportancePopulation mobility is closely associated with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which could inform proactive non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina (SC) is one of the states which reopened early and then suffered from a sharp increase of COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility to predict daily new cases at both state- and county-levels in SC.

Design, setting, and participantsThis longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020 to describe their changes, examine their correlation, and forecast daily COVID-19 new cases in two-week window in SC and its top five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases. Poisson count time series model was employed to carry out the research goals.

Main outcome and measureThe main outcome was daily new case which was calculated by subtracting the cumulative confirmed cases of previous day from the total cases. Population mobility was assessed using the number of users with travel distance larger than 0.5 mile which was calculated based on their geotagged twitters.

ResultsPopulation mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence and those of the top five counties (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, Richland). At the state-level, final model with time window within the last 7-day had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3-, 7-, 14-days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9-, 14-, 28-, 20-, and 9-days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3% to 74.5%.

Conclusions and relevancePopulation mobility was positively associated with COVID-19 incidences at both state- and county-levels in SC. Using Twitter-based mobility data could provide acceptable prediction for COVID-19 daily new cases. Population mobility measured via social media platform could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and their negative influences.

Key pointsHow did population mobility impact and predict the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in South Carolina (SC)?

FindingsThis study leveraged disease surveillance data, Twitter-based mobility data, and Poisson time series model to investigate the relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 daily incidences at both state- and county-levels in SC. Population mobility was positively associated with the COVID-19 outbreaks and could provide an acceptable prediction of COVID-19 daily new cases within two-week window.

MeaningThese findings suggested that population mobility affects the COVID-19 transmission and using Twitter-based mobility data could provide acceptable prediction for further COVID-19 spread as well as inform proactive measures for disease control.",Chengbo Zeng; Jiajia Zhang; Zhenlong Li; Xiaowen Sun; Bankole Olatosi; Sharon Weissman; Xiaoming Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249119,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249119,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
135,Burden of predominant psychological reactions among the healthcare workers and general during COVID-19 pandemic phase: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"AimPresent systematic review and meta-analysis examined the burden of psychological reactions predominantly anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia during novel COVID-19 pandemic phase among the frontline healthcare, non-frontline healthcare and general.

MethodologyPubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS were searched for studies between Jan 1, 2020 to May 25, 2020. Brief protocol of the systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO database, (CRD42020186229).Any study that reported the burden of at least one of psychological reactions including anxiety or depression or stress or insomnia was eligible. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and results were synthesized using random effect meta-analysis.

ResultsOut of 52eligible studies, 43 reported anxiety, 43 reported depression, 20 reported stress and 11 reported insomnia. Overall prevalence for anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were 26.6%, 26.2%,26.2% and 34.4% respectively. Anxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients (43.3% and 51.75 respectively). Apart from COVID-19 patients, prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were found highest among the frontline healthcare (27.2%, 32.1%,55.6% and 34.4% respectively) as compared to general healthcare workers (26.9%, 15.7%, 7.0% and 34.0% respectively) and general population (25.9%, 25.9%,25.4% and 29.4% respectively).

ConclusionAnxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients. Apart from COVID-19 patients, the anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were more prevalent among frontline healthcare workers compared to general. Such increased prevalence is prompting towards the global mental health emergency. Therefore a call of urgent attention and pan-region effective mental-health intervention are required to mitigate these psychological reactions.",Bhaskar Thakur; Mona Pathak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249126,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249126,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
136,Brazilian model estimation for SARS-CoV-2 peak contagion (BMESPC): first and second wave,"With newer data for SARS-CoV-2 and entering the second wave of contagion required the improvement of the forecasting model, structuring its model to forecast the peak of the first and second contagion wave in Brazil. The Brazilian model estimation for SARS-CoV-2 peak contagion (BMESPC) was structured, capable of estimating the peak of contagion for SARS-CoV-2 in the first and second waves, as the main objective of this work. Using the BMESPC model, it was possible to estimate, with a certain reliability degree, the peak of contagion for the first and second waves in Brazil, with one day difference from the real to the forecast. While at the state level, the calculated confidence interval proved to be more accurate. In this way, it is possible to use BMESPC to forecast the peak of contagion for several regions, provided that the necessary structure and calibration are respected.",Guilherme Asai; Andre Kuroiva; Manuella Lucca Terra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.20248940,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.20248940,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
137,Humoral and cell-mediated response in colostrum after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"BackgroundColostrum provides an immune sharing between a mother and her infant. The transfer in colostrum of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the elicited cytokines may provide crucial protection to the infant. There is limited literature on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 present in colostrum.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and the associated cytokines in colostrum from women who tested positive for the virus.

Study DesignBetween March and September 2020 we obtained bilateral colostrum samples collected on spot cards within 48 hours of delivery from 15 new mothers who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five of these 15 COVID-19 positive women also provided bilateral liquid colostrum within 1-2 days of providing the spot card samples. Archived bilateral colostrum samples collected from 8 women during 2011-2013 were used as pre-COVID-19 controls. All samples were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an ELISA that measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM, and for concentrations of 10 inflammatory cytokines (IFN{gamma}, TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13) using a multiplex electrochemiluminescent sandwich assay.

ResultsBilateral colostrum samples from 73%, 73% and 33% of the 15 COVID-19 mothers exhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM reactivity to RBD respectively. Colostrum samples from two of the 8 pre-pandemic controls showed IgA and IgG reactivity to RBD. Additionally, COVID-19 mothers had significantly higher levels of 9 of the 10 inflammatory markers (all except IFN{gamma}) as compared to the pre-COVID-19 controls. Comparable results were obtained with both the spot card-eluates and liquid samples.

ConclusionsA strong humoral immune response is present in the colostrum of women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before delivering. High levels of 9 inflammatory markers were also present in the colostrum. The evolution and duration of the antibody response, as well as dynamics of the cytokine response, remain to be determined. Our results also indicate that future large-scale studies can be conducted with milk easily collected on paper spot cards.",Vignesh Narayanaswamy; Brian Pentecost; Dominique Alfandari; Emily Chin; Kathleen Minor; Alyssa Kastrinakis; Tanya Lieberman; Kathleen F Arcaro; Heidi Leftwich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20248715,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20248715,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
138,Nested pool testing strategy for the reliable identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2,"The progress of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires the design of cost-effective testing programs at large scale. To this end, pooling multiple samples can provide a solution. Defining a cost-effective strategy requires the establishment of an efficient deconvolution and re-testing procedure that eventually allows the identifcation of the carrier. Based on Dorfmans algorithm, we developed an adaptive nested strategy for which we have, for a given prevalence, simple analytic expressions of the optimal number of samples in the starting pool, of the number of partitioning steps (stages) in the optimal path, of the pool sizes in each of these stages and of the expected average number of tests needed to identify the infected individuals. In this paper we analyze the strategy in detail focusing on its practical implementation when there are restrictions that prevent the use of the optimum. More specifically, we analyze how to proceed when the infection prevalence is poorly known a priori or when the optimal requires starting with pool sizes that are too large for the reliable detection of an infected sample. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR assay, the gold standard RNA detection method, is a major concern in the case of SARS-CoV-2: it is estimated that half of the infected individuals give false negative results. Recently, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was shown to be 10 - 100 times more sensitive than RT-qPCR, making this technology suitable for pool testing. ddPCR has the added value of providing the direct quantification of the RNA content at the end of the test. In the paper we show how this feature can be used for verification purposes. The analyses and strategies presented here should be useful to those considering the adoption of a pooling approach for RNA detection, particularly, for the identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Author summaryThe progress of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires the design of cost-effective testing programs at large scale. Running tests on pooled samples can provide a solution if the tests sensitivity is high enough. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the current gold standard test, RT-qPCR, has shown some limitations that only allow the use of pools with relatively few samples. In this regard, Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been shown to be 10 - 100 times more sensitive than RT-qPCR, making it suitable for test pooling. In this paper we describe a nested pool testing method in which the properties that make it optimal are simple analytic functions of the infection prevalence. We discuss how to proceed in practical implementations of the strategy, particularly when there are constraints that prevent the use of the optimal. We also show how its nested nature can be combined with the direct RNA quantification that the ddPCR test provides to identify the presence of unviable samples in the pools and for self-consistency tests. The studies of this paper should be useful for those considering the adoption of test pooling for RNA detection.",Ines Armendariz; Pablo A Ferrari; Daniel Fraiman; Jose Mario Martinez; Hugo G Menzella; Silvina Ponce Dawson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249170,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249170,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
139,Evaluation of serological lateral flow assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed.

MethodsWe evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence.

ResultsCombined IgG+IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9% to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6% to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG+IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG+IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 g/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 g/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek.

ConclusionWe provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values.",Bianca A. Trombetta; Savannah E. Kandigian; Robert R.

140,Autoimmune anti-DNA antibodies predict disease severity in COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 can lead to severe disease and death, however the mechanisms of pathogenesis in these patients remain poorly understood. High levels of autoimmune antibodies have been observed frequently in COVID-19 patients but their specific contribution to disease severity and clinical manifestations remain unknown.

We performed a retrospective study of 115 COVID-19 hospitalized patients with different degrees of severity to analyze the generation of autoimmune antibodies to common antigens: a lysate of erythrocytes, the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and DNA.

High levels of IgG autoantibodies against erythrocyte lysates were observed in a large percentage (up to 41%) of patients. Anti-DNA antibodies determined upon hospital admission correlated strongly with later development of severe disease, showing a positive predictive value of 89.5% and accounting for 22% of total severe cases. Statistical analysis identified strong correlations between anti-DNA antibodies and markers of cell injury, coagulation, neutrophil levels and erythrocyte size.

141,SARS-CoV-2 induces a durable and antigen specific humoral immunity after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 infection,"Current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays generate discrepant results, and the longitudinal characteristics of antibodies targeting various antigens after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 are yet to be established. This longitudinal cohort study including 1972 healthcare workers, of which 386 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in the vast majority of participants, 98%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. These antibody levels did not differ from those found in 59 convalescent COVID-19 patients (p=0.7). Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 93% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 68% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers, and these four-month follow-up levels were substantially lower in healthcare workers than in convalescent COVID-19 patients (p=2*10-5). Our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.",Sebastian Havervall; August Jernbom Falk; Jonas Klingstrom; Henry Ng; Nina Greilert Norin; Lena Gabrielsson; Ann-Christine Salomonsson; Eva Isaksson; Ann-Sofie Rudberg; Cecilia Hellstrom; Eni Andersson; Jennie Olofsson; Lovisa Skoglund; Jamil Yousef; Elisa Pin; Wanda Christ; Mikaela Olausson; My Hedhammar; Hanna Tegel; Sara Mangsbo; Mia Phillipson; Anna Manberg; Sophia Hober; Peter Nilsson; Charlotte Thalin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249162,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249162,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
142,The Impact of the November 2020 English National Lockdown on COVID-19 case counts,"In the UK the epidemic of COVID-19 continues to pose a significant threat to public health. On the 14th October the English government introduced a tier system for control of the epidemic but just 3 weeks later a National lockdown across all areas of England was implemented. When English areas emerged from Lockdown many were placed in different tiers (most typically moved up at least one tier). However, the effectiveness of the tier system has been challenged by the emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 which appears to be much more infectious. In addition, from early November a trial mass testing service was being run in Liverpool. We used publicly available data of daily cases by local authority (local government areas) and estimated the reproductive rate (R value) of the epidemic based on 7-day case numbers compared with the previous 7-day period. There was a clear surge in infections from a few days before to several days after the lockdown was implemented. But this surge was almost exclusively associated with Tier 1 and Tier 2 authorities. In Tier 3 authorities where hospitality venues were only allowed to operate as restaurants there was no such surge. After this initial surge, cases declined in all three tiers with the R value dropping to a mean of about 0.7 independent of tier. London, The South East and East of England Regions saw rising infection rates in the last week or so of lockdown primarily in children of secondary school age. We could find no obvious benefit of the trial mass screening programme in Liverpool city. We conclude that in Tiers 1 and 2 much of the beneficial impact of the national lockdown was lost probably because of the leak of its likely implementation five days early leading to increased socialising in these areas before the start of lockdown. We further conclude that given that the new variant is estimated to have an R value of between 0.39 and 0.93 greater than previous variants, any lockdown as strict as the November one would be insufficient to reverse the increase in infections by itself. The value of city-wide mass testing to control the epidemic remains uncertain.",Paul R Hunter; Julii Suzanne Brainard; Alastair R Grant,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249169,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249169,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
143,How vaccination and contact isolation might interact to suppress transmission of Covid-19: a DCM study,"This report describes a dynamic causal model that could be used to address questions about the rollout and efficacy of vaccines in the United Kingdom. For example, is suppression of community transmission a realistic aspiration? And, if not, what kind of endemic equilibrium might be achieved? What percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated? And over what timescale? It focuses on the synergies among (i) vaccination, (ii) the supported isolation of contacts of confirmed cases and (iii) restrictions on contact rates (i.e., lockdown and social distancing). To model these mitigations, we used a dynamic causal model that embeds an epidemiological model into agent-based behavioural model. The model structure and parameters were optimised to best explain responses--to the first and subsequent waves--enabling predictions over the forthcoming year under counterfactual scenarios. Illustrative analyses suggest that the full potential of vaccination is realised by increasing the efficacy of contact tracing: for example, under idealised (best case) assumptions--of an effective vaccine and efficient isolation of infected pre-symptomatic cases-- suppression of community transmission would require 50% herd immunity by vaccinating 22% by the end of 2021; i.e., 15 million people or about 50,000 per day. With no change in the isolation of contacts, 36% would require vaccination, i.e., 25 million people. These figures should not be read as estimates of the actual number of people requiring vaccination; however, they illustrate the potential of this kind of model to quantify interactions among public health interventions. We anticipate using this model in a few months--to estimate the average effectiveness of vaccines when more data become available.",Karl J.

144,"What is the value of community oximetry monitoring in people with SARS-CoV-2? A prospective, open-label clinical study","BackgroundIn people with COVID-19, hypoxia at the time of admission is known to be related to mortality. Monitoring of oxygen saturations (SpO2) is therefore an increasingly common part of community-based care, with the aim of improving the identification of adults who are deteriorating. We set out to investigate whether rigid SpO2 triggers, or absolute change in SpO2, is more indicative of deterioration in COVID-19.

MethodsA prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study in a large UK general practice was conducted between May and November 2020. Participants recorded twice daily oximetry and symptom diary for 14 days after test-confirmed COVID-19. Primary outcomes were the proportion of people whose SpO2 dropped to [&le;] 94% and [&le;] 92%, the average maximum reduction in SpO2, and admission to hospital. We also investigated the relationship between MRC Dyspnoea scale, modified Roth score, and SpO2 through correlation analyses.

Results52 participants were recruited, following which 41 participants completed the study. The average age was 45.9 years with 63.4% identifying as female. The mean maximum reduction in SpO2 was 2.8%. The average time to maximum reduction in SpO2 was 6.4 days. Nine participants (22.0%) had a reduction in SpO2 to [&le;]94%. Three of these had a reduction in SpO2 to [&le;]92%, for which all three were admitted to hospital. Modified Roth score and SpO2 were weakly positively correlated (.31). MRC dyspnoea scale score and SpO2 were moderately negatively correlated (-.53).

ConclusionsA reduction in SpO2 to [&le;]92% was found to be highly predictive for admission to hospital. Modified Roth score or MRC dyspnoea scale scores should not be used as proxy measures for oximetry. This study contributes to the ongoing narrative around community-based oximetry and provides insight and recommendations for those currently engaging in or planning to roll out similar schemes.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis study is pragmatically designed to answer an important clinical question in primary care.
C_LIO_LIThis study focused on previously published values of SpO2 for triggering escalation of care and therefore provides answers based on current clinical practice.
C_LIO_LI11 of the 52 patients who were recruited into the study did not return their oximeter or oximetry diary at the end of the study period.
C_LIO_LIWe did not validate the accuracy or reliability of the oximetry / symptom diaries, as these were self-completed by the participants themselves.

AimsTo rapidly review recently-published literature on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsQuery of all quantitative research through the PubMed database on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic which utilized validated mental health instruments. 723 articles were screened and 87 articles were included.

ResultsNearly all included studies were cross-sectional, survey-based assessments of the prevalence of and risk factors for mental illness. Only one interventional study was identified. Prevalence of mental health outcomes varied widely: 7.0-97.3% anxiety, 10.6-62.1% depression, 2.2-93.8% stress, 3.8-56.6% post traumatic stress, 8.3-88.4% insomnia, and 21.8-46.3% burnout. Risk and protective factors were identified in personal and professional domains, including degree of COVID-19 exposure, adequacy of protective equipment, and perception of organizational support.

146,On the lag between deaths and infections in the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic,"One of the key issues in fighting the current pandemic, or the ones to come, is to obtain objective quantitative indicators of the effectiveness of the measures taken to contain the epidemic. The aim of this work is to point out that the lag between the daily number of infections and casualties provides one such indicator. For this we determined the lag during the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic for a series of countries using the data available at the server of the John Hopkins University using three different methods. Somewhat surprisingly, we find a lag varying substantially between countries, taking negative values (thus the maximum daily number of casulties preceding the maximum daily namber of new infections) in countries where no steps to contain the epidemic have been taken at the outset, with an average lag of 7 {+/-} 0.3 days. Our results can be useful to health authorities in a search for the best strategy to fight the epidemic.

Key MessagesO_LIThe lags between the maximum daily infections and casualties during the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic differ widely between countries.
C_LIO_LIThese lags are clear for some countries, but impossible to determine confidently for most.
C_LIO_LIIn some countries the day at which the maximal number of daily deaths is attained precedes the day of the maximal number of casualties, indicating a failure to protect the most vulnerable part of the population.

147,"Accuracy of the Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index for predicting short-term mortality among 1,307 Yale New Haven Hospital inpatients and 427,224 Medicare patients","BackgroundThe Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index incorporates age, sex, and pre-existing comorbidity diagnoses readily available in the electronic health record (EHR) to predict 30-day all-cause mortality in both inpatients and outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We examined the performance of the Index using data from Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and national Medicare data overall, over time, and within important patient subgroups.

Methods and findingsWith measures and weights previously derived and validated in a national Veterans Healthcare Administration (VA) sample, we evaluated the accuracy of the VACO Index for estimating inpatient (YNHH) and both inpatient and outpatient mortality (Medicare) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and comparisons of predicted versus observed mortality by decile (calibration plots). The VACO Index demonstrated similar discrimination and calibration in both settings, over time, and among important patient subgroups including women, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. In sensitivity analyses, we allowed component variables to be re-weighted in the validation datasets and found that weights were largely consistent with those determined in VA data. Supplementing the VACO Index with body mass index and race/ethnicity had no effect on discrimination.

ConclusionAmong COVID-19 positive individuals, the VACO Index accurately estimates risk of short-term mortality among a wide variety of patients. While it modestly over-estimates risk in recent intervals, the Index consistently identifies those at greatest relative risk.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 429 RT-PCR confirmed COVID- 19 patients who were on follow up from July to October 2020 and with complete clinical and laboratory data. Data was described using frequency tables. Robust Poisson regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 disease severity where adjusted relative risk (RR), P-value and 95% CI for RR were used to test significance and interpretation of results. Binary Logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of statistically significant association between the explanatory variables and COVID-19 disease outcome where adjusted odds ratio, P- value and 95% CI for adjusted odds ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results

ResultsAmong the 429 patients studied, 182 (42.4%) had Severe disease at admission and the rest 247 (57.6%) had Non-severe disease (15.6% mild and 42.0% moderate). Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive. Age group (ARR= 1.779, 95% CI= 1.405- 2.252, p-value < 0.0001), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (ARR= 4.769, 95% CI= 2.419 - 9.402 p-value <0.0001), Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (ARR= 1.358, 95% CI= 1.109- 1.662 p-value=0.003), Sodium (ARR= 1.321, 95% CI= 1.091- 1.600 p-value=0.004) and Potassium (ARR= 1.269, 95% CI= 1.059-1.521 p-value=0.010) were found to be significant predictors of COVID-19 disease severity.

The following factors were significantly associated with COVID-19 disease outcome; age group (AOR= 2.767, 95% CI= 1.099 - 6.067, p-value=0.031), white blood cell count (AOR= 4.253, 95% CI= 1.918 - 9.429, p-value=0.0001) and sodium level (AOR= 3.435, 95% CI= 1.439, 8.198, p-value=0.005).

ConclusionsThe laboratory markers of NLR of above three, raised SGOT and deranged sodium and potassium levels (both hypo- and hyper-states) were found to be significant predictors of developing severe COVID-19 disease. In addition, deranged values of white blood cell count and sodium levels were significantly associated with worse outcome of the disease. Therefore, assessing and monitoring these laboratory markers at the earliest stage of the disease could have a considerable impact in halting disease progression and death.",Tigist W.

149,Structure-function investigation of a new VUI-202012/01 SARS-CoV-2 variant,"The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) has accumulated multiple mutations during its global circulation. Recently, a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 (VUI 202012/01) had been identified leading to sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in South-East England. The strain has accumulated 23 mutations which have been linked to its immune evasion and higher transmission capabilities. Here, we have highlighted structural-function impact of crucial mutations occurring in spike (S), ORF8 and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Some of these mutations might confer higher fitness to SARS-CoV-2.

SummarySince initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city of central China, its causative agent; SARS-CoV-2 virus has claimed more than 1.7 million lives out of 77 million populations and still counting. As a result of global research efforts involving public-private-partnerships, more than 0.2 million complete genome sequences have been made available through Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Similar to previously characterized coronaviruses (CoVs), the positive-sense single-stranded RNA SARS-CoV-2 genome codes for ORF1ab non-structural proteins (nsp(s)) followed by ten or more structural/nsps [1, 2]. The structural proteins include crucial spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins. The S protein mediates initial contacts with human hosts while the E and M proteins function in viral assembly and budding. In recent reports on evolution of SARS-CoV-2, three lineage defining non-synonymous mutations; namely D614G in S protein (Clade G), G251V in ORF3a (Clade V) and L84S in ORF 8 (Clade S) were observed [2-4]. The latest pioneering works by Plante et al and Hou et al have shown that compared to ancestral strain, the ubiquitous D614G variant (clade G) of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits efficient replication in upper respiratory tract epithelial cells and transmission, thereby conferring higher fitness [5, 6]. As per latest WHO reports on COVID-19, a new strain referred as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01) had been identified as a part of virological and epidemiological analysis, due to sudden rise in COVID-19 detected cases in South-East England [7]. Preliminary reports from UK suggested higher transmissibility (increase by 40-70%) of this strain, escalating Ro (basic reproduction number) of virus to 1.5-1.7 [7, 8]. This apparent fast spreading variant inculcates 23 mutations; 13 non-synonymous, 6 synonymous and 4 amino acid deletions [7]. In the current scenario, where immunization programs have already commenced in nations highly affected by COVID-19, advent of this new strain variant has raised concerns worldwide on its possible role in disease severity and antibody responses. The mutations also could also have significant impact on diagnostic assays owing to S gene target failures.",Jasdeep Singh; Nasreen Z Ehtesham; Syed Asad Rahman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.425028,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.425028,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,False
150,Spike protein disulfide disruption as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2,"The coronaviral pandemic is exerting a tremendously detrimental impact on global health, quality of life and the world economy, emphasizing the need for effective medications for current and future coronaviral outbreaks as a complementary approach to vaccines. The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39{degrees}C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37{degrees}C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high {micro}M - low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability. Our research demonstrates the clear potential for medications that disrupt Spike disulfides as broad-spectrum anticoronaviral agents and as a first-line defense against current and future outbreaks.",Andrey M.

151,The ancient cardioprotective mechanisms of ACE2 bestow SARS-CoV-2 with a wide host range,"SARS-CoV-2 infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously anticipated, suggesting there may be additional unknown hosts wherein the virus can evolve and potentially circumvent effective vaccines. We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2. This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis) conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2. Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination, explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19 and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

152,Glycan reactive anti-HIV-1 antibodies bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein but do not block viral entry,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a focal point for vaccine immunogen and therapeutic antibody design, and also serves as a critical antigen in the evaluation of immune responses to COVID-19. A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via Fc{gamma}RII receptor engagement. Nevertheless, ELISA and other immunoreactivity experiments demonstrate these antibodies are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike in a glycan-dependent manner. These results contribute to the growing literature surrounding SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivity, as we demonstrate the ability for cross-reactive antibodies to interfere in immunoassays.",Dhiraj Mannar; Karoline Leopold; Sriram Subramaniam,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.425141,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.425141,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,False
153,Comprehensive mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that affect recognition by polyclonal human serum antibodies,"The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent serum antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spikes receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of serum neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal serum antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but there is substantial variation in the impact of mutations both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBDs receptor binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some sera is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in emerging viral lineages in South Africa and Brazil. Going forward, these serum escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",Allison J Greaney; Andrea N Loes; Katharine HD Crawford; Tyler N Starr; Keara D Malone; Helen Y Chu; Jesse D Bloom,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.425021,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.425021,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,False
154,SARS-CoV-2 Fusion Peptide has a Greater Membrane Perturbating Effect than SARS-CoV with Highly Specific Dependence on Ca2+,"Coronaviruses are a major infectious disease threat, and include the zoonotic-origin human pathogens SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (SARS-2, SARS-1, and MERS). Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2 cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue difference, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.",Alex Liqi Lai; Jack H Freed,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425297,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425297,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,False
155,"The SARS-CoV-2 antibody landscape is lower in magnitude for structural proteins, diversified for accessory proteins and stable long-term in children","BackgroundChildren are less clinically affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults with the majority of cases being mild or asymptomatic and the differences in infection outcomes are poorly understood. The kinetics, magnitude and landscape of the antibody response may impact the clinical severity and serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of the antibody landscape in children and adults is needed.

MethodsWe tested 254 plasma from 122 children with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Hong Kong up to 206 days post symptom onset, including 146 longitudinal samples from 58 children. Adult COVID-19 patients and pre-pandemic controls were included for comparison. We assessed antibodies to a 14-wide panel of SARS-CoV-2 structural and accessory proteins by Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS).

FindingsChildren have lower levels of Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies than adults, and their cumulative humoral response is more expanded to accessory proteins (NSP1 and Open Reading Frames (ORFs)). Sensitive serology using the three N, ORF3b, ORF8 antibodies can discriminate COVID-19 in children. Principal component analysis revealed distinct serological signatures in children and the highest contribution to variance were responses to non-structural proteins ORF3b, NSP1, ORF7a and ORF8. Longitudinal sampling revealed maintenance or increase of antibodies for at least 6 months, except for ORF7b antibodies which showed decline. It was interesting to note that children have higher antibody responses towards known IFN antagonists: ORF3b, ORF6 and ORF7a.

We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo.4,5 Several candidate compounds, Avoralstat, PCI-27483, Antipain, and Soybean-Trypsin-Inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays. Avoralstat, a clinically tested Kallikrein-related B1 inhibitor,6 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human airway epithelial cells.

157,The impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns accounting for antibody-dependent enhancement,"BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines.

Methods and findingsWe introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and - importantly - some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications.

We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75% 80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions.

ConclusionsWith the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next years flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.",Nessma Adil M.

159,Paired heavy and light chain signatures contribute to potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in public antibody responses,"Understanding protective mechanisms of antibody recognition can inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We discovered a new antibody, 910-30, that targets the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor binding site as a member of a public antibody response encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 genes. We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients. These data reveal key structural and functional neutralization features in the IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibody class to accelerate antibody-based medical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.

160,The functions of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and infection-enhancing antibodies in vitro and in mice and nonhuman primates,"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) protect against COVID-19, making them a focus of vaccine design. A safety concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, we isolated potent NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or a history of SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies demonstrated function-specific modes of antibody binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated Fc receptor-{gamma} (Fc{gamma}R)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated Fc{gamma}R-independent in vitro infection enhancement. However, both in vitro neutralizing and infection-enhancing RBD or infection-enhancing NTD antibodies protected from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in non-human primates and mice. One of 30 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had lung pathology and bronchoalveolar lavage cytokine evidence suggestive of enhanced disease.

161,Sequencing of Sars-CoV-2 genome using different Nanopore chemistries,"Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a rapid and cost-efficient tool for diagnostic and epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compared results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in timine and adenine homopolymeric regions than R9, at expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions.

The LSK had a larger yield than RBK, and provided longer reads than RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99% vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome.

The results from this study suggest that the LSK used on a R9 flow cell could maximize the yield and accuracy of the consensus sequence when used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.

162,Comprehensive analysis of the host-virus interactome of SARS-CoV-2,"Host-virus protein-protein interaction is the key component of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lifecycle. We conducted a comprehensive interactome study between the virus and host cells using tandem affinity purification and proximity labeling strategies and identified 437 human proteins as the high-confidence interacting proteins. Functional characterization and further validation of these interactions elucidated how distinct SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins participate in its lifecycle, and discovered potential drug targets to the treatment of COVID-19. The interactomes of two key SARS-CoV-2 encoded viral proteins, NSP1 and N protein, were compared with the interactomes of their counterparts in other human coronaviruses. These comparisons not only revealed common host pathways these viruses manipulate for their survival, but also showed divergent protein-protein interactions that may explain differences in disease pathology.

163,Unbuttoning the impact of N501Y mutant RBD on viral entry mechanism: A computational insight,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a serious global threat. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for this pandemic has imposed a severe burden on the medical settings. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an important structural protein playing a key role in the viral entry. This protein is responsible for the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process. The recent reports of the appearance and spread of new SARS-CoV-2 strain has raised alarms. It was reported that this new variant containing the prominent active site mutation in the RBD (N501Y) was rapidly spreading within the population. The reported N501Y mutation within the spikes essential part, known as the  receptor-binding domain has raised several questions. Here in this study we have tried to explore the effect of N501Y mutation within the spike protein using several in silico approaches",Tanuj Sharma; Mohammad Hassan Baig; Moniba Rahim; Jae-June Dong; Jae-Yong Cho,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424906,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424906,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,False
164,Rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on copper touch surfaces determined using a cell culture infectivity assay,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in China in 2019 and has transmitted rapidly around the world, currently responsible for 83 million reported cases and over 1.8 million deaths. The mode of transmission is believed principally to be airborne exposure to respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients but there is also a risk of the droplets contaminating fomites such as touch surfaces including door handles, stair rails etc, leading to hand pick up and transfer to eyes, nose and mouth. We have previously shown that human coronavirus 229E survives for more than 5 days on inanimate surfaces and another laboratory reproduced this for SARS-CoV-2 this year. However, we showed rapid inactivation of Hu-CoV-229E within 10 minutes on different copper surfaces while the other laboratory indicated this took 4 hours for SARS-CoV-2. So why the difference? We have repeated our work with SARS-CoV-2 and can confirm that this coronavirus can be inactivated on copper surfaces in as little as 1 minute. We discuss why the 4 hour result may be technically flawed.",C William Keevil; Catherine A Bryant; Sandra A Wilks,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.424974,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.424974,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,False
165,Alveolar type II cells harbouring SARS-CoV-2 show senescence with a proinflammatory phenotype,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory system can evolve to a multi-system disease. Excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines, known as a  cytokine storm are associated with high mortality rates especially in the elderly and in patients with age-related morbidities. Senescent cells, characterized by secretion of such cytokines (Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype - SASP), are known to occur in this context as well as upon a variety of stressogenic insults. Applying both: i) a novel ""in house"" antibody against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ii) a unique senescence detecting methodology, we identified for the first time in lung tissue from COVID-19 patients alveolar cells acquiring senescent features harboring also SARS-CoV-2.

166,Public Search Interests related to COVID-19: Insights from Google Search Trends in Bangladesh,"ObjectivePublic response monitoring is critical to reducing COVID-19 infections and developing effective public health strategies. This study explored Google search trends to understand public responses to COVID-19 concerns in Bangladesh.

MethodsWe used country-level Google search trends data to examine the association between Google search terms related to COVID-19 deaths, face masks, and COVID-19 vaccines and the actual and one-week lagged actual COVID-19 death counts from February 2, 2020, to December 19, 2020, in Bangladesh. Results: Search terms related to COVID-19 deaths, face masks, and COVID-19 vaccines increased and peaked during March and April, but then began declining gradually after June 2020. The mean relative search volume for face masks (35 points) was higher than for death information (8 points) and vaccines (16 points) throughout the study period, and searching for masks peaked (100 points) during the third week of March. Search interests for death information and face masks were negatively correlated with the actual and one-week lagged actual COVID-19 death counts.

167,Determinants of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19; a prospective cohort study from Pakistan,"A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Indus Hospital Karachi, Pakistan between March and June 2020 to describe the determinants of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 186 adult patients were enrolled and all-cause mortality was found to be 36% (67/186). Those who died were older and more likely to be males (p<0.05). Temperature and respiratory rate were higher among non-survivors while Oxygen saturation was lower (p<0.05). Serum CRP, D-dimer and IL-6 were higher while SpO2 was lower on admission among non-survivors (p<0.05). Non-survivors had higher SOFA and CURB-65 scores while thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and severe ARDS was more prevalent among them (p<0.05). Use of non-invasive ventilation in emergency room, ICU admission and invasive ventilation were associated with mortality in our cohort (p<0.05). Length of hospital stay and days of intubation were longer in non-survivors (p<0.05). Use of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, tocilizumab, antibiotics, IVIG or anticoagulation showed no mortality benefit (p>0.05). Multivariable logistic regression showed that age > 60 years, oxygen saturation <93% on admission, pro-calcitonin > 2 ng/ml, unit rise in temperature and SOFA score, ICU admission and sepsis during hospital stay were associated with higher odds of mortality. Larger prospective studies are needed to further strengthen these findings.

168,Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions: when can the UK relax about COVID-19?,"The announcement of efficacious vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 has been met with worldwide acclaim and relief. Many countries already have detailed plans for vaccine targeting based on minimising severe illness, death and healthcare burdens. Normally, relatively simple relationships between epidemiological parameters, vaccine efficacy and vaccine uptake predict the success of any immunisation programme. However, the dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is made more complex by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection and the potential relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines. In this study we use an age-structured mathematical model, matched to a range of epidemiological data, to consider the interaction between the UK vaccination programme and future relaxation (or removal) of NPIs. Our predictions highlight the population-level risks of early relaxation leading to a pronounced wave of infections, and the individual-level risk relative to vaccine status. While the novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for this outbreak, this is highly contingent on the transmission blocking action of the vaccine and the population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored as vaccine programmes are rolled out in the UK and other countries.",Sam Moore; Edward M Hill; Michael Tildesley; Louise M Dyson; Matt J Keeling,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20248896,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20248896,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
169,Quantitative plasma proteomics of survivor and non-survivor COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital unravels potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets,"The development of new approaches that allow early assessment of which cases of COVID-19 will likely become critical and the discovery of new therapeutic targets are urgent demands. In this cohort study, we performed proteomic and laboratorial profiling of plasma from 163 patients admitted to Bauru State Hospital (Bauru, SP, Brazil) between May 4th and July 4th, 2020, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab samples. Plasma samples were collected upon admission for routine laboratory analyses and shotgun quantitative label-free proteomics. Based on the course of the disease, the patients were further divided into 3 groups: a) mild symptoms, discharged without admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (n=76); b) severe symptoms, discharged after admission to an ICU (n=56); c) critical, died after admission to an ICU (n=31). White cells and neutrophils were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. Lymphocytes were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild ones and platelets were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Ferritin, TGO, urea and creatinine were significantly higher in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Albumin, CPK, LDH and D-dimer were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. PCR was significantly higher in severe patients compared to mild ones. Proteomic analysis revealed marked changes between the groups in plasma proteins related to complement activation, blood coagulation, antimicrobial humoral response, acute inflammatory response, and endopeptidase inhibitor activity. Higher levels of IREB2, GELS, POLR3D, PON1 and ULBP6 upon admission to hospital were found in patients with mild symptoms, while higher levels of Gal-10 were found in critical and severe patients. This needs to be validated in further studies.

170,Development of a saliva-optimized RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2,"Conventional reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technology has struggled to fulfill the unprecedented need for diagnostic testing created by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Complexity and cost hinder access to testing, and long turnaround-time decreases its utility. To ameliorate these issues, we focus on saliva and introduce several advances to colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology; RT-LAMP offers a minimal equipment alternative to RT-qPCR. First, we validated the use of the novel dye LAMPShade Violet (LSV), which improves the visual clarity and contrast of the colorimetric readout. Second, we compared different inactivation conditions on infectivity and RNA yield from saliva. Third, we developed a ten-minute RNA purification protocol from saliva.

All sequences were publicly available on the National Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI) platform. Using specific methodologies for paired FST, AMOVA, mismatch, demographic-spatial expansion, molecular diversity and for the time of evolutionary divergence, it was possible to notice that only 79 sites remained conserved and that the high number of polymorphisms found helped to establish a clear pattern of genetic non-structuring, based on the time of divergence between the groups.

173,A renewal equation model to assess roles andlimitations of contact tracing for diseaseoutbreak control,"We propose a deterministic model capturing essential features of contact tracing as part of public health non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate an outbreak of an infectious disease. By incorporating a mechanistic formulation of the processes at the individual level, we obtain an integral equation (delayed in calendar time and advanced in time since infection) for the probability that an infected individual is detected and isolated at any point in time. This is then coupled with a renewal equation for the total incidence to form a closed system describing the transmission dynamics involving contact tracing. We define and calculate basic and effective reproduction numbers in terms of pathogen characteristics and contact tracing implementation constraints. When applied to the case of SARS-CoV-2, our results show that only combinations of diagnosis of symptomatic infections and contact tracing that are almost perfect in terms of speed or coverage can attain control, unless additional measures to reduce overall community transmission are in place. Under constraints on the testing or tracing capacity, the interruption of contact tracing may be irreversible and, depending on the overall growth rate and prevalence of the disease, may lead to outbreaks even in cases when the epidemic was initially under control.",Francesca Scarabel; Lorenzo Pellis; Nicholas H Ogden; Jianhong Wu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20232934,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20232934,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
174,Perception and awareness of COVID-19 among health science students and staff of Kuwait University: An online cross-sectional study,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented. Health science students are the future frontliners to fight pandemics. Awareness and perception toward COVID-19 among health science students and staff at Kuwait University was assessed.

MethodsBetween June and July 2020, an online questionnaire was distributed to all students and staff at HCS. The questionnaire was divided into six sections: socio-demography, risk and awareness, preparedness and prevention, source of information, policies, and social stigma.

ResultsA total of 592 students and 162 staff completed the questionnaire. The prevalence of self-reported chronic condition among students and staff was 14.0% and 19.1%, respectively. Moreover, self-reported COVID-19 prevalence among students and staff was 2.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Interestingly, 54% of students and 38.3% of staff reported that they knew someone within their immediate social environment who have been/are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among students, 92.4% wore face mask in indoor places (outside of their home) often/all the time compared to wearing it outdoors (69.3%); whereas, for staff, it was more common to wear it outdoor than in indoor places (75.9% vs. 81.5%). Both students and staff showed greatest deal of trust was in official government press release and consultation with healthcare workers.

Willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine was indicated by 50% of students strongly agreed and an additional 25.8% agreed to taking it. Interest vaccine uptake was lower among staff (28.4% and 34.6% strongly agreed or agreed, respectively).

175,Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"BackgroundVaccination is crucial to address the COVID-19 pandemic but vaccine hesitancy could undermine control efforts. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK population, identify which population subgroups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and report stated reasons for vaccine hesitancy.

MethodsNationally representative survey data from 12,035 participants were collected from 24th November to 1st December 2020 for wave 6 of the  Understanding Society COVID-19 web survey. Participants were asked how likely or unlikely they would be to have a vaccine if offered and their main reason for hesitancy. Cross-sectional analysis assessed prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and logistic regression models conducted.

FindingsOverall intention to be vaccinated was high (82% likely/very likely). Vaccine hesitancy was higher in women (21.0% vs 14.7%), younger age groups (26.5% in 16-24 year olds vs 4.5% in 75+) and less educated (18.6% no qualifications vs 13.2% degree qualified). Vaccine hesitancy was particularly high in Black (71.8%), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (42.3%), Mixed (32.4%) and non-UK/Irish White (26.4%) ethnic groups. Fully adjusted models showed gender, education and ethnicity were independently associated with vaccine hesitancy. Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy were 12.96 (95% CI:7.34, 22.89) in the Black/Black British and 2.31 (95% CI:1.55, 3.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups (compared to White British/Irish ethnicity) and 3.24 (95%CI:1.93, 5.45) for people with no qualifications compared to degree educated. The main reason for hesitancy was fears over unknown future effects.

InterpretationOlder people at greatest COVID-19 mortality risk expressed the greatest willingness to be vaccinated but Black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups had greater vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine programmes should prioritise measures to improve uptake in specific minority ethnic groups.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Embase and Medline up to November 16, 2020, using key words ""vaccine hesitancy"" and ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"". Vaccine hesitancy is complex but also context specific. Previous research about vaccine hesitancy relates to existing adult and childhood vaccines, with limited evidence currently available on willingness to be vaccinated for newly available COVID-19 vaccines. Existing vaccination programmes often have lower uptake among more socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Uptake of vaccines has often varied across ethnic groups, but patterns have often varied across different vaccine programmes.

Added value of this studyOur study describes the sub-groups of the UK population who are more likely to be hesitant about a COVID-19 vaccine and examines possible explanations for this. We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 survey element of the UKs largest household panel study. We asked specifically about vaccine hesitancy in relation to a COVID-19 vaccine at a time when initial results of vaccine trials were being reported in the media. We found willingness to be vaccinated is generally high across the UK population but marked differences exist across population subgroups. Willingness to be vaccinated was greater in older age groups and in men. However, some minority ethnic groups, particularly Black/Black British and Pakistani/Bangladeshi, had high levels of vaccine hesitancy but this was not seen across all minority ethnic groups. People with lower education levels were also more likely to be vaccine hesitant.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe current evidence base on vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 is rapidly emerging but remains limited. Polling data has also found relatively high levels of willingness to take up a COVID-19 vaccine and suggested greater risks of vaccine hesitancy among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people. Our study suggests that the risk of vaccine hesitancy differs across minority ethnic groups considerably, with Black ethnic groups particularly likely to be vaccine hesitant within the UK. Some White minority ethnic groups are also more likely to be vaccine hesitant than White British/Irish people.

Premorbid comorbidities and clinical status, severity of COVID-19 disease, complications during and after hospitalization were recorded.

ResultsAt 6-month follow-up after hospitalisation due to COVID-19 disease, patients displayed a wide array of neurological symptoms, being fatigue (34%), memory/attention (31%), and sleep disorders (30%) the most frequent. Subjects reporting neurological symptoms were affected by more severe respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection parameters during hospitalisation. At neurological examination, 37.4% of patients exhibited neurological abnormalities, being cognitive deficits (17.5%), hyposmia (15.7%) and postural tremor (13.8%) the most common.

178,Simulating the impacts of interregional mobility restriction on the spatial spread of COVID-19 in Japan,"This study develops a spatial Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model that analyzes the effect of interregional mobility on the spatial spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Japan. National and local governments have requested that residents refrain from traveling between 47 prefectures during the state of emergency. However, the extent to which restricting the interregional mobility prevents infection expansion has not been elucidated. Our spatial SEIR model describes the spatial spread pattern of COVID-19 when people commute to a prefecture where they work or study during the daytime and return to their residential prefecture at night. We assume that people are exposed to infection risk during their daytime activities. According to our simulation results, interregional mobility restriction can prevent geographical expansion of the infection. However, in prefectures with many infectious individuals, residents are exposed to higher infection risk when their mobility is restricted. Our simulation results also show that interregional mobility restriction plays a limited role in reducing the national total number of infected individuals.",Keisuke Kondo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248926,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248926,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
179,The Ugandan Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Model: A Data Driven Approach to Estimate Risk,"ObjectivesThe first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified on March 21, 2020, in Uganda. The number of cases increased to 8,287 by September 30, 2020. By May throughout June, most of the cases were predominantly imported cases of truck drivers from neighbouring countries. Uganda responded with various restrictions and interventions including lockdown, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and use of face masks in public, to control the growth rate of the outbreak. By end of September 2020, Uganda had transitioned into community transmissions and most of the reported cases were locals contacts and alerts. This study assessed risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda, and presents estimates of the reproduction ratio in real time. An optimal control analysis was performed to determine how long the current mitigation measures such as controlling the exposure in communities, rapid detection, confirmation and contact tracing, partial lockdown of the vulnerable groups and control at the porous boarders, could be implemented and at what cost.

MethodsThe daily confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda were extracted from publicly available sources. Using the data, relative risks for age, gender, and geographical location were determined. Four approaches were used to forecast SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda namely linear exponential, nonlinear exponential, logistic and a deterministic model. The discrete logistic model and the next generation matrix method were used to estimate the effective reproduction number.

ResultsResults showed that women were at a higher risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 than the men, and the population attributable risk of SARS-CoV-2 to women was 42.22%. Most of the women affected by SARS-CoV-2 were likely contacts of cargo truck drivers at the boarders, where high infection rates were reported. Although most deaths in Uganda were in the age group of 60-69, the highest case fatality rate per 1000 was attributable the age group of 80-89, followed by 70-79. Geographically, Amuru had the highest relative risk compared to the national risk to SARS-CoV-2. For the case of mitigation scenarios, washing hands with 70% com pliance and regular hand washing of 6 times a day, was the most effective and sustainable to reduce SARS- CoV-2 exposure. This was followed by public wearing of face masks if at least 60% of the population complied, and physical distancing by 60% of the population. If schools, bars and churches were opened without compliance, i.e., no distancing, no handwashing and no public wearing of face masks, to mitigation measures, the highest incidence was observed, leading to a big replacement number. If mitigation measures are not followed by the population, then there will be high incidences and prevalence of the virus in the population.",Betty K Nannyonga; Henry Kyobe Bosa; Yonas Tegegn Wodermariam; Pontiano Kaleebu; John Ssenkusu; Tom Lutalo; Willford Kirungi; Fredrick Edward Makumbi; Vincent Aloysius Ssembatya; Henry G Mwebesa; Diana Atwine; Jane Ruth Aceng; Rhoda K Wanyenze,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248922,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
180,The evaluation of a newly developed antigen test (QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag) for SARS-CoV-2: A prospective observational study in Japan,"IntroductionSeveral antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed worldwide, but their clinical utility has not been well established. In this study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag, a newly developed antigen test in Japan.

MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated.

ResultsA total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confident interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) >30). In symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%).

ConclusionQuickNavi-COVID19 Ag showed high specificity and sufficient sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

182,"Covid-19, Lockdowns and Motor Vehicle Collisions: Empirical Evidence from Greece","Reduced mobility during Covid-19 lockdowns means fewer vehicles at risk of collision, but also an opportunity to speed on empty streets. Other collision risk factors that have changed during the pandemic include alcohol consumption, sleeping patterns, distraction, unemployment and economic uncertainty. Evidence on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on motor vehicle collisions is scarce, as such statistics are often released with a delay. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first lockdown on motor vehicle collisions and associated injuries and deaths in Greece. Using monthly data at the regional unit level, I provide descriptive evidence and subsequently follow a difference-in-difference econometric approach, comparing trends in 2020 to those of the previous five years while controlling for unemployment and petrol prices. I found a steep decline in collisions, injuries and deaths compared to what would have been otherwise expected. In March and April 2020, there were about 1,226 fewer collisions, 72 fewer deaths, 40 fewer serious injuries and 1,426 fewer minor injuries compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic.",Sotiris Vandoros,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.20248883,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.20248883,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
183,"Non-medical COVID-19-related personal impact in medical ecological perspective: A global multileveled, mixed method study","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread public health measures to reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While much research and focus surrounds COVID-19 vaccine development, testing, and supportive management, little is known about the determinants of non-medical, personal impact of COVID-19 prevention policies. We aimed to understand determinants of non-medical COVID-19 impact and to account for its multileveled, intersectional nature of associations.

MethodsThis cross-sectional, multi-level, convergent mixed-methods study assessed a range of beliefs, practices, and experiences relating to COVID-19. We recruited a global sample (n=7,411) using both Facebook and Amazon mTURK platforms. We constructed a novel data-driven non-medical COVID-19 Impact Score and four subcomponents (""Personal Action,"" ""Supply-related,"" ""Cancellations,"" and ""Livelihood"" impacts). We used generalized estimating equation models with identity link functions to determine concomitant association of individual, household, and country-level variables on the impact scores. We also classified 20,015 qualitative excerpts from 6859 respondents using an 80-code codebook.

ResultsTotal and component impact scores varied significantly by region with Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean observing the highest impact scores. Multilevel modeling indicated that individual-level sociocultural variables accounted for much of this variation with COVID-related worry, knowledge, struggles in accessing food and supplies, and worsening mental health most strongly associated with non-medical impact. Family responsibilities, personal COVID medical experience, and health locus of control - in addition to country-level variables reflecting social and health challenge - were also significantly and independently associated with non-medical impact.

DiscussionNon-medical personal impact of COVID-19 affects most people internationally, largely in response to shutdowns, implementing prevention requirements, and through economic consequences. In the context where most of the worlds population does not have direct medical experience with COVID-19, this phenomena of non-medical impact is profound, and likely impacts sustainability of public health interventions aimed at containing COVID-19.",Timothy De Ver Dye; Brooke Levandowski; Shazia Siddiqi; Jose G.

184,MVA Vector Vaccines Inhibit SARS CoV-2 Replication in Upper and Lower Respiratory Tracts of Transgenic Mice and Prevent Lethal Disease,"Replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a licensed smallpox vaccine and numerous clinical studies investigating recombinant MVAs (rMVAs) as vectors for prevention of other infectious diseases have been completed or are in progress. Two rMVA COVID-19 vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported. Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs. A low amount of virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of subgenomic mRNA in turbinates on day 2 only indicated that replication was abortive in immunized animals.

SignificanceVaccines are required to control COVID-19 during the pandemic and possibly afterwards. Recombinant nucleic acids, proteins and virus vectors that stimulate immune responses to the CoV-2 S protein have provided protection in experimental animal or human clinical trials, though questions remain regarding their ability to prevent spread and the duration of immunity. The present study focuses on replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which has been shown to be a safe, immunogenic and stable smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector for other infectious diseases and cancer. In a transgenic mouse model, one or two injections of recombinant MVAs that express modified forms of S inhibited CoV-2 replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and prevented severe disease.",Ruikang Liu; Jeffrey L Americo; Catherine A Cotter; Patricia L Earl; Noam Erez; Chen Peng; Bernard Moss,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424878,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424878,2021-01-01,2021-01-01,,False
185,The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 is associated with increased interaction force between Spike-ACE2 caused by the viral N501Y mutation,"The Spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the viral particles binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells. Therefore, Spike-ACE2 interaction is a crucial determining factor for viral infectivity. A new phylogenetic group of SARS-CoV-2 (lineage B.1.1.7) has been recently identified in the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium dataset, which features an amino acid substitution in the Spike RBD (N501Y mutation). Infections with the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 have been overgrowing in recent weeks in the United Kingdom, indicating an even greater spread capacity than that seen with previous strains of the novel coronavirus. We hypothesized that this rapid spreading/infectivity of the B.1.1.7 lineage might be due to changes in the interaction force between the mutant Spike RBD and ACE2. This study employed in silico methods involving mutagenesis (N501Y mutation) and interface analysis focusing on the Spike RDB-ACE2 interaction. The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutant (lineage B.1.1.7) establishes a more significant number of interactions relating to the mutant residue Y501 (Spike RDB) with residues Y41 and K353 (ACE2). This finding shows that the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is associated with the interaction force between the Spike RBD Y501 mutant residue with the ACE2 receptor, which in this strain is increased.",Jadson C Santos; Geraldo A Passos,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424708,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424708,2021-01-01,2021-01-01,,False
186,SARS-CoV-2 positivity in asymptomatic-screened dental patients,"Enhanced community surveillance is a key pillar of the public health response to COVID-19. Asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood. Disruption of dental services continues with significantly reduced capacity. Ongoing precautions include pre- and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centres across Scotland invited asymptomatic screened patients over 5-years-old to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardised VTM-containing testkits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/e-mail with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. Over a 13-week period (from 3August to 31October2020) n=4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these n=22 (0.5%; 95%CI 0.5%, 0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing Infection Prevention Control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as healthcare team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues.

187,Factors influencing intention to adhere to precautionary behavior in times of COVID- 19 pandemic in Sudan: an application of the Health Belief Model,"BackgroundCorona virus disease (covid-19) is an emerging highly infectious disease caused by novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). Several public health and social protective measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 were introduced. However, these measures are unfortunately neglected or deliberately ignored by some individuals.

ObjectiveTo identify the factors influencing intention to adhere to precautionary measures againstCOVID-19 in Sudan.

Methods and DesignCross sectional online based survey using virtual convenience sampling technique.

Variables MeasuredPerceived threat of corona virus (perceived severity and perceived susceptibility), perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and intention to adhere to precautionary behavior towards COVID-19

ResultsThe significant predictors of intention to adhere to the precautionary behavior against COVID-19 were: gender ({beta} =3.34, P <0.001), self-efficacy ({beta}= 0.476, P<0.001), perceived benefits ({beta}= 0.349, P<0.001) and perceived severity ({beta}= 0.113, P=0.005). These factors explained 43% of the variance in participants intention to adhere to the protective measures. Participants who were female, confident in their ability to adhere to the protective measures when available, believing in the benefits of the protective measures against COVID-19 and perceiving that the disease could have serious consequences were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures.

188,Meta-analysis of virus-induced host gene expression reveals unique signatures of immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2,"The clinical outcome of COVID-19 has an extreme age, genetic and comorbidity bias that is thought to be driven by an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global health has resulted in multiple studies generating a variety of large gene expression datasets in a relatively short period of time. In order to better understand the immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, we carried out a meta-analysis of these transcriptomics data available in the published literature. Datasets included both those available from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines in vitro and those from patient samples. We focused our analysis on the identification of viral perturbed host functions as captured by co-expressed gene module analysis. Transcriptomics data from lung biopsies and nasopharyngeal samples, as opposed to those available from other clinical samples and infected cell lines, provided key signatures on the role of the hosts immune response on COVID-19 pathogenesis. For example, severity of infection and patients age are linked to the absence of stimulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, a known critical immediate line of defense against RNA viral infections that triggers type-I interferon responses. In addition, co-expression analysis of age-stratified transcriptional data provided evidence that signatures of key immune response pathways are perturbed in older COVID-19 patients. In particular, dysregulation of antigen-presenting components, down-regulation of cell cycle mechanisms and signatures of hyper-enriched monocytes were strongly correlated with the age of older individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our meta-analysis highlights the ability of transcriptomics and gene-module analysis of aggregated datasets to aid our improved understanding of the host-specific disease mechanisms underpinning COVID-19.",Srikeerthana Kuchi; Quan Gu; Massimo Palmarini; Sam J Wilson; David L Robertson,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424739,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424739,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,False

Here, we systematically explored the transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) for therapeutic targeting using approved drugs. We integrated a resource of TF-cytokine gene interactions with single-cell RNA-seq expression data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells of COVID-19 patients. We found 581 significantly correlated interactions, between 95 TFs and 16 cytokines upregulated in the COVID-19 patients, that may contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. Among these, we identified 19 TFs that are targets of FDA approved drugs. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs and 25 drug combinations on inflammatory cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which revealed two drugs that inhibited cytokine production and numerous combinations that show synergistic efficacy in downregulating cytokine production.

190,Pharmacophore-based peptide biologics neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S1 and deter S1-ACE2 interaction in vitro,"Effective therapeutics and stable vaccine are the urgent need of the day to combat COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a pivotal role in cell-entry and host immune response, thus regarded as potential drug- and vaccine-target. As the virus utilizes the S1 domain of spike to initiate cell-attachment and S2 domain for membrane fusion, several attempts have been made to design viral-receptor and viral-fusion blockers. Here, by deploying interactive structure-based design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptide-biologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro. CSNP4 possibly enhance the mAb-based S1 neutralization by limiting the spontaneous movement of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas CSNP2 allowed RBD-mAb binding without any steric hindrance. Taken together, we suggest that CSNP2 and CSNP4 are potent and stable candidate peptides that can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike and possibly pose the virus to host immune surveillance.",Hyun Goo Woo; Masaud Shah; Sung Ung Moon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424801,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424801,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,False

The world urgently needs a cost-effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine, antiviral and therapeutic drugs to control the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we engineered the Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike protein (S) variants (Receptor binding domain, RBD and S1 domain) of SARS-CoV-2 genes and produced in Nicotiana benthamiana plant. The purification yields were at least 20 mg of pure protein/kg of plant biomass for each target protein. The S protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 showed specific binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The purified plant produced N and S variants were recognized by N and S protein specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies demonstrating specific reactivity of mAb to plant produced N and S protein variants. In addition, IgG responses of plant produced N and S antigens elicited significantly high titers of antibody in mice. This is the first report demonstrating production of functional active S1 domain and Nucleocapsid protein of SARC-CoV-2 in plants. In addition, in this study, for the first time, we report the co-expression of RBD with N protein to produce a cocktail antigen of SARS-CoV-2, which elicited high-titer antibodies compared to RBD or N proteins.

The pandemic has led to the closure of enterprises and schools in many countries, resulting in serious disruption of the global economy and social activities. Remdesivir is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19, but the WHO declared that Remdesivir is almost ineffective against COVID-19. The research and development of vaccines has made great progress, but it will take at least several months for safe and effective vaccines to be widely used clinically. Clinical studies revealed that some Traditional Chinese Medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Capsule and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water, exhibited excellent therapeutic effect on COVID-19. However, until now, there is still no cure for COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find medicines that can effectively fight against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, JIE BEN No. 10 (JB10), a fermentation broth produced by Yi traditional medicine fermentation technology, was explored for its anti-coronavirus activity. The in vitro data showed that JB10 could significantly suppresses the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 769.1 times dilution and a selection index of 42.68. Further studies indicated that JB10 had significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The analysis of active components suggested that JB10 contained a large amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD), flavones, polyphenols, crude polysaccharide, etc. which may explain the anti-coronavirus activity, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

With limited therapeutic options, the identification of safe and effective therapeutics is urgently needed. The repurposing of known clinical compounds holds the potential for rapid identification of drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2. Here we utilized a library of FDA-approved and well-studied preclinical and clinical compounds to screen for antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in human pulmonary epithelial cells. We identified 13 compounds that exhibit potent antiviral activity across multiple orthogonal assays. Hits include known antivirals, compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, and compounds targeting host pathways such as kinases and proteases critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We identified seven compounds not previously reported to have activity against SARS-CoV-2, including B02, a human RAD51 inhibitor. We further demonstrated that B02 exhibits synergy with remdesivir, the only antiviral approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, highlighting the potential for combination therapy.

Our ability to understand the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells within the lung, and of protective or dysfunctional immune responses to the virus, is critical to effectively treat these patients. Currently, our understanding of cell-cell interactions across different disease states, and how such interactions may drive pathogenic outcomes, is incomplete. Here, we developed a generalizable workflow for identifying cells that are differentially interacting across COVID-19 patients with distinct disease outcomes and use it to examine five public single-cell RNA-seq datasets with a total of 85 individual samples. By characterizing the cell-cell interaction patterns across epithelial and immune cells in lung tissues for patients with varying disease severity, we illustrate diverse communication patterns across individuals, and discover heterogeneous communication patterns among moderate and severe patients. We further illustrate patterns derived from cell-cell interactions are potential signatures for discriminating between moderate and severe patients.",Yingxin Lin; Lipin Loo; Andy Tran; Cesar Moreno; Daniel Hesselson; Greg G Neely; Jean Yee Hwa Yang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424641,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424641,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,False
195,"Process Development and Scale-up Optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain-Based Vaccine Candidate, RBD219-N1C1","A SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 (RBD219-N1C1) recombinant protein antigen formulated on Alhydrogel(R) has recently been shown to elicit a robust neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in mice. The antigen has been produced under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and is now in clinical testing. Here, we report on process development and scale-up optimization for upstream fermentation and downstream purification of the antigen. This includes production at the 1 and 5 L scale in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, and the comparison of three different chromatographic purification methods. This culminated in the selection of a process to produce RBD219-N1C1 with a yield of >400 mg per liter of fermentation with >92% purity and >39% target product recovery after purification. In addition, we show the results from analytical studies, including SEC-HPLC, DLS, and an ACE2 receptor binding assay that were performed to characterize the purified proteins to select the best purification process. Finally, we propose an optimized upstream fermentation and downstream purification process that generates quality RBD219-N1C1 protein antigen and is fully scalable at a low cost.",Jungsoon Lee; Zhuyun Liu; Wen-Hsiang Chen; Junfei Wei; Rakhi Kundu; Rakesh Adhikari; Joanne Altieri Rivera; Portia M Gillespie; Ulrich Strych; Bin Zhan; Peter J Hotez; Maria Elena Bottazzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424829,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424829,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,False
196,Development of a Multivariable Model for COVID-19 Risk Stratification Based on Gradient Boosting Decision Trees,"ImportancePopulation stratification of the adult population in Ontario, Canada by their risk of COVID-19 complications can support rapid pandemic response, resource allocation, and decision making.

ObjectiveTo develop and validate a multivariable model to predict risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 severity from routinely collected health records of the entire adult population of Ontario, Canada.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study included 36,323 adult patients (age [&ge;] 18 years) from the province of Ontario, Canada, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between February 2 and October 5, 2020, and followed up through November 5, 2020. Patients living in long-term care facilities were excluded from the analysis.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was estimated via Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, and risk factor importance was examined via Shapley values.

ResultsThe study cohort included 36,323 patients with majority female sex (18,895 [52.02%]) and median (IQR) age of 45 (31-58) years. The cohort had a hospitalization rate of 7.11% (2,583 hospitalizations) with median (IQR) time to hospitalization of 1 (0-5) days, and a mortality rate of 2.49% (906 deaths) with median (IQR) time to death of 12 (6-27) days. In contrast to patients who were not hospitalized, those who were hospitalized had a higher median age (64 years vs 43 years, p-value < 0.001), majority male (56.25% vs 47.35%, p-value<0.001), and had a higher median [IQR] number of comorbidities (3 [2-6] vs 1 [0-3], p-value<0.001). Patients were randomly split into development (n=29,058, 80%) and held-out validation (n=7,265, 20%) cohorts. The final Gradient Boosting model was built using the XGBoost algorithm and achieved high discrimination (development cohort: mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the five folds of 0.852; held-out validation cohort: 0.8475) as well as excellent calibration (R2=0.998, slope=1.01, intercept=-0.01). The patients who scored at the top 10% in the validation cohort captured 47.41% of the actual hospitalizations, whereas those scored at the top 30% captured 80.56%. Patients in the held-out validation cohort (n=7,265) with a score of at least 0.5 (n=2,149, 29.58%) had a 20.29% hospitalization rate (positive predictive value 20.29%) compared with 2.2% hospitalization rate for those with a score less than 0.5 (n=5,116, 70.42%; negative predictive value 97.8%). Aside from age, gender and number of comorbidities, the features that most contribute to model predictions were: history of abnormal blood levels of creatinine, neutrophils and leukocytes, geography and chronic kidney disease.

ConclusionsA risk stratification model has been developed and validated using unique, de-identified, and linked routinely collected health administrative data available in Ontario, Canada. The final XGBoost model showed a high discrimination rate, with the potential utility to stratify patients at risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. This model demonstrates that routinely collected health system data can be successfully leveraged as a proxy for the potential risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Specifically, past laboratory results and demographic factors provide a strong signal for identifying patients who are susceptible to complications. The model can support population risk stratification that informs patients protection most at risk for severe COVID-19 complications.",Jahir M Gutierrez; Maksims Volkovs; Tomi Poutanen; Tristan Watson; Laura Rosella,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248783,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248783,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
197,Unraveling COVID-19-related hospital costs: The impact of clinical and demographic conditions,"IntroductionAlthough patients clinical conditions were previously shown to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and outcomes, their impact on hospital costs is not known. The economic evaluation of COVID-19 admissions allows the assessment of hospital costs associated with the treatment of these patients, including the main cost components and costs driven by demographic and clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs and their association with clinical conditions.

MethodsProspective observational cohort study of the hospitalization costs of patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 30 and June 30, 2020, who were followed until discharge, death, or external transfer, using micro-costing methodology. The study was carried out in the Central Institute of the Hospital das Clinicas, affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which is the largest hospital complex in Latin America and was designated to exclusively admit COVID-19 patients during the pandemic response.

ResultsThe average cost of the 3,254 admissions (51.7% of which involved intensive care unit (ICU) stays) was US$12,637.42. Overhead cost was the main cost component, followed by daily fixed costs and drugs. Sex, age and underlying hypertension (US$14,746.77), diabetes (US$15,002.12), obesity (US$18,941.55), cancer (US$10,315.06), chronic renal failure (US$15,377.84), and rheumatic (US$17,764.61), hematologic (US$15,908.25) and neurologic diseases (US$15,257.95) were significantly associated with higher costs. Age >69 years, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19, comorbidities, the use of mechanical ventilation, dialysis, or surgery, and poor outcomes remained significantly associated with higher costs after model adjustment.

ConclusionKnowledge of COVID-19-associated hospital costs and their impact across different populations can aid in the development of a generalizable and comprehensive approach to hospital preparedness, decision-making and planning for future risk management. Determining the disease-associated costs is the first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs.

SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs?

FindingsIn this prospective cohort that was carried out in a single reference quaternary center designated for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, more than three thousand patients were included, and their costs of hospitalization were found to be directly related to the age and comorbidities. The costs were more than 50% higher in older patients, 10-24% higher in patients with comorbidities, and 24-200% higher when additional therapeutic procedures were required.

One of the main questions in the human mind is whether the COVID-19 epidemic will happen again. Therefore, a criterion must be set for the occurrence or non-occurrence of the disease. With the Retarded SEIRS model and this criterion, we can predict whether the Covid-19 will re-emerge. So far, a large number of researches that have been presented in scientific groups or communities have been based on the SIR or SEIR model. But we assume that each recovered individual is immune to the disease for a limited time, and then will be susceptible again.

199,S gene dropout patterns in SARS-CoV-2 tests suggest spread of the H69del/V70del mutation in the US.,"Recently, multiple novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of amino acids H69 and V70 in the virus S gene. This includes strain B.1.1.7 / SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and travel restrictions leaving the UK. Here, we analyze 2 million RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at Helix to identify the rate of S gene dropout, which has been recently shown to occur in tests from individuals infected with strains of SARS-CoV-2 that carry the H69del/V70del mutation. We observe a rise in S gene dropout in the US starting in early October, with 0.25% of our daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting this pattern during the first week. The rate of positive samples with S gene dropout has grown slowly over time, with last week exhibiting the highest level yet, at 0.5%. Focusing on the 14 states for which we have sufficient sample size to assess the frequency of this rare event (n>1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples), we see a recent expansion in the Eastern part of the US, concentrated in MA, OH, and FL. However, we cannot say from these data whether the S gene dropout samples we observe here represent the B.1.1.7. strain. Only with an expansion of genomic surveillance sequencing in the US will we know for certain the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 strain in the US.",Nicole L Washington; Simon White; Kelly m Schiabor Barrett; Elizabeth T Cirulli; Alexandre Bolze; James T Lu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248814,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248814,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
200,Smoking and SARS-CoV-2 Impair Dendritic Cells and Regulate DC-SIGN Expression in Tissues,"The current spreading novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and pathogenic. In this study, we screened the gene expression of three SARS-CoV-2 host receptors (ACE2, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) and DC status in bulk and single cell transcriptomic datasets of upper airway, lung or blood of smokers, non-smokers and COVID-19 patients. We found smoking increased DC-SIGN gene expression and inhibited DC maturation and its ability of T cell stimulation. In COVID-19, DC-SIGN gene expression was interestingly decreased in lung DCs but increased in blood DCs. Strikingly, DCs shifted from cDCs to pDCs in COVID-19, but the shift was trapped in an immature stage (CD22+ or ANXA1+ DC) with MHCII downregulation in severe cases. This observation indicates that DCs in severe cases stimulate innate immune responses but fail to specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides insights into smoking effect on COVID-19 risk and the profound modulation of DC function in severe COVID-19.

201,The interplay between subcritical fluctuations and import: understanding COVID-19 epidemiology dynamics,"The effective reproduction ratio r(t) parameter of an epidemic, defined as the average number of secondary infected cases per infectious case in a population in the current state, including both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts, controls the transition between a sub-critical threshold regime (r(t) < 1) and a supercritical threshold regime r(t) > 1). While in sub-critical regimes, an index infected case will cause an outbreak that will die out sooner or later, with large fluctuations observed when approaching the epidemic threshold, the supercritical regimes leads to an exponential growths of infection.

The super- or sub-critical regime of an outbreak is often not distinguished when close to the epidemic threshold, but its behaviour is of major importance to understand the course of an epidemic and public health management of disease control. In a sub-critical parameter regime undetected infection, here called ""imported case"" or import, i.e. a susceptible individual becoming infected from outside the study area e.g., can either spark recurrent isolated outbreaks or keep the ongoing levels of infection, but cannot cause an exponential growths of infection. However, when the community transmission becomes super-critical, any index case or few ""imported cases"" will lead the epidemic to an exponential growths of infections, hence being distinguished from the sub-critical dynamics by a critical epidemic threshold in which large fluctuations occur in stochastic versions of the considered processes.

As a continuation of the COVID-19 Basque Modeling Task Force (BMTF), we now investigate the role of critical fluctuations and import in basic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological models on disease spreading dynamics. Without loss of generality, these simple models can be treated analytically and, when considering the mean field approximation of more complex underlying stochastic and eventually spatially extended or generalized network processes, results can be applied to more complex models used to describe the COVID-19 epidemics. In this paper, we explore possible features of the course of an epidemic, showing that the sub-critical regime can explain the dynamic behaviour of COVID-19 spreading in the Basque Country, with this theory supported by real data.",Nico Stollenwerk; Joseba Bidaurrazaga; Javier Mar; Irati Eguiguren; Nicole Cusimano; Maira Aguiar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248840,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248840,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
202,"Contact Tracing of COVID-19 in Karnataka, India: Superspreading and Determinants of Infectiousness and Symptomaticity","Brief AbstractWe analysed SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and contact tracing data from Karnataka, India up to 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of infectiousness and the tendency for superspreading (overdispersion), and evaluated potential determinants of infectiousness and symptomaticity in COVID-19 cases. Among 956 cases confirmed to be forward-traced, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases, suggesting significant heterogeneity in individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in underlying number of contacts. Secondary attack rate was 3.6% among 16715 close contacts. Transmission was higher when index case was aged >18 years, or was symptomatic (adjusted risk ratio, aRR 3.63), or was lab-confirmed [&ge;]4 days after symptom onset (aRR 3.01). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. This could potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are suggested to confirm this. Mean serial interval was 5.4 days. Adding backward contact tracing and targeting control measures to curb super-spreading may be prudent. Due to low symptomaticity and infectivity, interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing transmission.

Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSIndia has experienced the second largest outbreak of COVID-19 globally, yet there is a paucity of studies analysing contact tracing data in the region. Such studies can elucidate essential transmission metrics which can help optimize disease control policies.

MethodsWe analysed contact tracing data collected under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of disease transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We evaluated the effect of age and other factors on the risk of transmitting the infection, probability of asymptomatic infection, and mortality due to COVID-19.

FindingsUp to 21 July, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of [&ge;]8 secondary cases. R and k were most reliably estimated at R 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91) and k 0.12 (0.11-0.15) for confirmed traced cases (n=956); and R 0.91 (0.72-1.15) and k 0.22 (0.17-0.27) from the three largest clusters (n=394). Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6% (3.4-3.9) and symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.04-4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19-44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07-0.66] for 0-5 years and 0.47 [0.32-0.68] for 6-18 years). Infectors who were confirmed [&ge;]4 days after symptom onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11-4.31]). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 (3.29-20.24) times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 (4.4-6.4) days with a Weibull distribution. Overall case fatality rate was 2.5% (2.4-2.7) which increased with age.

ConclusionWe found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised, retrospective contact tracing should be considered, and contact tracing performance metrics should be utilised. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented. Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. There is some evidence that symptomatic cases produce secondary cases that are more likely to be symptomatic themselves which may potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Global efforts of genomic surveillance of the virus give chance to track the spread of the pandemic. Global emergence of some viral mutations called attention and various studies have been suggested about increased infectivity of the virus. Herein, we sequenced viral genomes isolated from 184 patients in Istanbul and analyzed clinical metadata for the investigation of any viral mutation which affects the disease course of the host. We did not detect any viral mutations affecting the disease outcome in our cohort. Besides, we observed intra-host mutations in 76% of the isolates. Insertion/deletion and stop-gain mutations are also significantly less common among intra-host variants compared to consensus viral genome mutations.

204,Will Proton Pump Inhibitors Lead to a Higher Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Progression to Severe Disease? A Meta-analysis,"BackgroundPrevious researches on the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) use and the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 have generated inconsistent findings. Therefore, this Meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the outcome in patients who take PPIs.

MethodsWe carried out a systematic search to identify potential studies until November 2020. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses and tests for publication bias were also performed.

ResultsEight articles with more than 268,683 subjects were included. PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95%CI = 0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11). While it can add risk of severe disease (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.20-1.99, P<0.001;) and secondary infection (OR=4.33, 95% CI=2.57-7.29). No publication bias was detected.

ConclusionsPPI use is not associated with increased risk infection and may not change the mortality risk of COVID-19, but appeared to be associated with increased risk of progression to severe disease and secondary infection.

DesignRetrospective cohort study

Participants and settingStaff working at a single tertiary referral hospital who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 January 2020 and 25 November 2020.

Main outcome measuresSource of COVID-19 infection.

ResultsOf 45 staff who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 19 were determined to be acquired at Austin Health. Fifteen (15/19; 79% [95% CI: 54-94%]) of these were identified through contact tracing and testing following exposures to other infected staff and were presumed to be staff-staff transmission, including 10 healthcare workers (HCWs) linked to a single ward that cared for COVID-19 patients. Investigation of the outbreak identified the staff tearoom as the likely location for transmission, with subsequent reduction in HCW infections and resolution of the outbreak following implementation of enhanced control measures in tearoom facilities. No HCW contacts (0/204; 0% [95% CI: 0-2%]) developed COVID-19 infection following exposure to unrecognised patients with COVID-19.

206,Acceptable Performance of the Abbott ID NOW Among Symptomatic Individuals with Confirmed COVID-19,"INTRODUCTIONPoint of care diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, such as the ID NOW, have great potential to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The ID NOW is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the first 7 days of symptom onset for COVID-19 if tested within 1 hour of specimen collection. However, clinical data on the performance of the ID NOW is limited, with many studies deviating from the manufacturers instructions and/or having small sample size.

METHODSAdults with COVID-19 in the community or hospital were recruited into the study. Paired throat swabs were collected, with one throat swab transported immediately in an empty sterile tube to the laboratory for ID NOW testing, and the other transported in universal transport media and tested by an in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay targeting the E-gene. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated.

RESULTS133 individuals were included in the study. 129 samples were positive on either the ID NOW and/or RT-PCR. Assuming any positive result on either assay represents a true positive, PPA of the ID NOW compared to RT-PCR with 95% confidence intervals was 89.1% [82.0% - 94.1%] and 91.6% [85.1% - 95.9%], respectively. When analyzing individuals with symptoms [&le;] 7 days and who had the ID NOW performed within an hour, ID NOW PPA increased to 98.2%.

207,Longitudinal variability in mortality predicts Covid-19 deaths,"Within Europe, death rates due to covid-19 vary greatly, with some countries being hardly hit while others to date are almost unaffected. It would be of interest to pinpoint the factors that determine a countrys susceptibility to a pandemic such as covid-19.

Here we present data demonstrating that mortality due to covid-19 in a given country could have been largely predicted even before the pandemic hit Europe, simply by looking at longitudinal variability of all-cause mortality rates in the years preceding the current outbreak. The variability in death rates during the influenza seasons of 2015-2019 correlate to excess mortality caused by covid-19 in 2020 (R2=0.48, p<0.0001). In contrast, we found no correlation between such excess mortality and age, population density, degree of urbanization, latitude, GNP, governmental health spendings or rates of influenza vaccinations.

These data may be of some relevance when discussing the effectiveness of acute measures in order to limit the spread of the disease and ultimately deaths. They suggest that in some European countries there is an intrinsic susceptibility to fatal respiratory viral disease including covid-19; a susceptibility that was evident long before the arrival of the current pandemic.",Jon O Lundberg; Hugo Zeberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248853,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248853,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
208,Paired SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutations Observed During Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 Viral Transfer from Humans to Minks and Back to Humans,"A mutation analysis of a collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes around the world via sequence, date, geographic location, and species has revealed a large number of variants from the initial reference sequence in Wuhan. It also reveals that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have infected mink populations in the Netherlands, Denmark, United States, and Canada. In these animals, a small set of mutations often in combination, in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) has apparently transferred back into humans. The viral genomic mutations in minks observed in the Netherlands and Denmark show the potential for new mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD to be introduced into humans by zoonotic transfer. Our data suggests that close attention to viral transfer from humans to farm animals and pets will be required to prevent build-up of a viral reservoir for future zoonotic transfer.",Reid Rubsamen; Scott Burkholz; Suman Pokhrel; Benjamin R Kraemer; Daria Mochly-Rosen; Richard T Carback III; Tom Hodge; Paul Harris; Serban Ciotlos; Lu Wang; CV Herst,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424003,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424003,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
209,Deep mining of early antibody response in COVID-19 patients yields potent neutralisers and reveals high level of convergence,"Passive immunisation using monoclonal antibodies will play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Until now, the majority of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery efforts have relied on screening B cells of patients in the convalescent phase. Here, we describe deep-mining of the antibody repertoires of hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a combination of phage display technology and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing to isolate neutralising antibodies and gain insights into the early antibody response. This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded potent neutralising antibodies with distinct mechanisms of action, including the identification of a novel non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody that is not expected to be affected by any of the major viral variants reported. The study highlighted the presence of potent neutralising antibodies with near germline sequences within both the IgG and IgM pools at early stages of infection. Furthermore, we highlight a highly convergent antibody response with the same sequences occurring both within this study group and also within the responses described in previously published anti-SARS-CoV-2 studies.",Georgia Bullen; Jacob D Galson; Pedro Villar; Lien Moreels; Line Ledsgaard; Giada Mattiuzzo; Gareth Hall; Emma M Bentley; Edward W Masters; David Tang; Sophie Millett; Danielle Tongue; Richard Brown; Ioannis Diamantopoulos; Kothai Parthiban; Claire Tebbutt; Rachael Leah; Krishna Chaitanya; Deividas Pazeraitis; Sachin B Surade; Omodele Ashiru; Lucia Crippa; Richard Cowan; Matthew W Bowler; Jamie I Campbell; Wing-Yiu Jason Lee; Mark D Carr; David Matthews; Paul Pfeffer; Simon E Hufton; Kovilen Sawmynaden; Jane Osbourn; John McCafferty; Aneesh Karatt-Vellatt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424711,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424711,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
210,Defective NETs Clearance contributes to sustained FXII Activation in COVID-19-associated Pulmonary Thrombo-Inflammation,"Coagulopathy and inflammation are hallmarks of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with increased mortality. The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Here, we report a role of the NETs/ Factor XII (FXII) axis for initiating procoagulant and proinflammatory reactions in COVID-19.

Proteomic analysis revealed enrichment of FXII in postmortem lung tissue from COVID-19 patients. Immunofluorescence analysis of COVID-19 lung tissue showed that FXII is activated in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vessel walls and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces. In particular, activated FXII (FXIIa) colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue, indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially caused by impaired NETs clearance via extracellular DNases. In contrast, addition of DNase I improved NETs clearance and reduced FXII activation in vitro. We propose that targeting both, FXIIa and the FXII activator NETs, is therapeutically effective in mitigating thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19.",Maike Frye; Hanna Englert; Chandini Rangaswamy; Carsten Deppermann; Jan-Peter Sperhake; Christoph Krisp; Danny Schreier; Emma Gordon; Sandra Konrath; Munif Haddad; Giordano Pula; Reiner Mailer; Hartmut Schlueter; Florian Langer; Klaus Pueschel; Kosta Panousis; Evi Stavrou; Coen Maas; Thomas Renne,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424644,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424644,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
211,Host Specific SARS-CoV-2 Mutations: Insertion of the Phenylalanine in the NSP6 Linked to the United Kingdome and Premature Termination of the ORF-8 Associated with the European and the United States of America Derived Samples.,"The coronavirus belongs to the order Nidovirales, which is known for the longest RNA genome virus. The polymerase enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 has proofreading functions, but still, the RNA viruses have a higher mutation rate than DNA viruses. The mutations in the viral genome provide a replication advantage in any population/geographical location and that may have profound consequences in the outcome and pathogenesis, diagnosis and patient management of the viral infection. In the present study, we have analysed full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, derived from symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients from all six continents to investigate the common mutations globally. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating independently, we identified total 313 mutations and some (21 mutations) of them are prevailing over time irrespective of geographical location. Another important finding, we are reporting here is, the mutation rate of the virus varies in different geographical locations suggesting the virus is adapting different strategies in the infected populations, having different genetic backgrounds across the globe. We have identified 11085TTT insertion (insertion of the Phenylalanine in NSP6 at position 38) mutation, which is mainly linked to the UK derived SARS-CoV-2 samples, we have also discovered non-sense mutation in ORF-8 after 17 amino acid is linked to the European and the USA derived SARS-CoV-2 samples.",Mohammad Khalid; Yousef Al-ebini; David Murphy; Maryam Shoai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424530,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424530,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False

SARSCoV-2 has infected more than 64 million people worldwide, claimed over 1.4 million lives and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, cross-reacting with eight {beta}-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting {beta}-coronaviruses, and broadly inhibiting entry of pseudotyped viruses from two coronavirus lineages. Cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography characterization reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery and indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with {beta}-coronaviruses from three lineages along with proof-of-concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination.

213,SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved s2m element dimerizes via a kissing complex and interacts with host miRNA-1307-3p,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle. The causative agent of the disease, SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival. Contained within the untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are believed to function in RNA replication, viral protein translation, and discontinuous transcription. While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the 3 UTR is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families. In this study, we demonstrate that the s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host cellular miRNA-1307-3p. Taken together, our results highlight the potential significance of the dimer structures formed by the s2m element in key biological processes and implicate the motif as a possible therapeutic drug target for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.",Joshua A.

Thus, to contain and study this variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is necessary to develop a specific molecular test to uniquely identify it. Using a completely automated pipeline involving deep learning techniques, we designed a primer set which is specific to SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 with >99% accuracy, starting from 8,923 sequences from GISAID. The resulting primer set is in the region of the synonymous mutation C16176T in the ORF1ab gene, using the canonical sequence of the variant B.1.1.7 as a reference. Further in-silico testing shows that the primer sets sequences do not appear in different viruses, using 20,571 virus samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), nor in other coronaviruses, using 487 samples from National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). In conclusion, the presented primer set can be exploited as part of a multiplexed approach in the initial diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, or used as a second step of diagnosis in cases already positive to Covid-19, to identify individuals carrying the B.1.1.7 variant.",Alejandro Lopez-Rincon; Carmina Perez-Romero; Alberto Tonda; Lucero Mendoza-Maldonado; Eric Claassen; Johan Garssen; Aletta D.

In this study, we focused on the human host cell transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which plays an important role in the viral life cycle by cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. TMPRSS2 is an attractive target and has received significant attention for the development of drugs against SARS and MERS. Starting with comparative structural modeling and binding model analysis, we developed an efficient pharmacophore-based approach and applied in a large-scale in silico database screening for small molecule inhibitors against TMPRSS2. A number of novel inhibitors were identified, providing starting points for further development of drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.",Xin Hu; Jonathan H Shrimp; Hui Guo; Alexey V.

216,LinearSampling: Linear-Time Stochastic Sampling of RNA Secondary Structure with Applications to SARS-CoV-2,"Many RNAs fold into multiple structures at equilibrium. The classical stochastic sampling algorithm can sample secondary structures according to their probabilities in the Boltzmann ensemble, and is widely used, e.g., for accessibility prediction. However, the current sampling algorithm, consisting of a bottom-up partition function phase followed by a top-down sampling phase, suffers from three limitations: (a) the formulation and implementation of the sampling phase are unnecessarily complicated; (b) much redundant work is repeatedly performed in the sampling phase; (c) the partition function runtime scales cubically with the sequence length. These issues prevent it from being used for full-length viral genomes such as SARS-CoV-2. To address these problems, we first present a hypergraph framework under which the sampling algorithm can be greatly simplified. We then present three sampling algorithms under this framework of which two eliminate redundant work in the sampling phase. Finally, we present LinearSampling, an end-to-end linear-time sampling algorithm that is orders of magnitude faster than the standard algorithm. For instance, LinearSampling is 111 x faster (48s vs. 1.5h) than Vienna RNAsubopt on the longest sequence in the RNAcentral dataset that RNAsubopt can run (15,780 nt). More importantly, LinearSampling is the first sampling algorithm to scale to the full genome of SARS-CoV-2, taking only 96 seconds on its reference sequence (29,903 nt). It finds 23 regions of 15 nt with high accessibilities, which can be potentially used for COVID-19 diagnostics and drug design.

217,Environmental Dependence of the Structure of the C-terminal Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Envelope Protein,"The SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E) is involved in a broad spectrum of functions in the cycle of the virus, including assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. To enable these activities, E is likely to be capable of changing its conformation depending on environmental cues. To investigate this issue, here we characterised the structural properties of the C-terminal domain of E (E-CTD), which has been reported to interact with host cell membranes. We first studied the conformation of the E-CTD in solution, finding characteristic features of a disordered protein. By contrast, in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles and micelles, which mimic cell membranes, the E-CTD was observed to become structured. The E-CTD was also found to display conformational changes with osmolytes. Furthermore, prolonged incubation of the E-CTD under physiological conditions resulted in amyloid-like fibril formation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the E-CTD can change its conformation depending on its environment, ranging from a disordered state, to a membrane-bound folded state, and an amyloid state. Our results thus provide insight into the structural basis of the role of E in the viral infection process.

219,SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 induces neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic. In addition to respiratory complications as a result of SARS-CoV-2 illness, accumulating evidence suggests that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with the disease caused by the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and iNOS/NO. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 increased protein expressions of phospho-p65 and phospho-I{kappa}B, as well as enhancing DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-{kappa}B. Pro-inflammatory effects of the glycoprotein effects were reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 M). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 in BV-2 microglia increased the protein expression of NLRP3, as well as caspase-1 activity. However, pre-treatment with CRID3 (1 M) or BAY11-7082 (1 M) resulted in the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1. It was also observed that CRID3 attenuated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increase in IL-1{beta} production. Increased protein expression of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike glycoprotein S1, and was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that promotion of neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein is mediated through activation of NF-{kappa}B, NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 MAPK. These results are significant because of their relevance to our understanding of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",Olumayokun A Olajide; Victoria U Iwuanyanwu; Oyinkansola D Adegbola,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424619,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424619,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
220,Landscapes and dynamic diversifications of B-cell receptor repertoires in COVID-19 patients,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Great international efforts have been put into the development of prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. However, the knowledge about the B cell immune response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of immunoglobin heavy chain (IGH) repertoire in COVID-19 patients. By using next-generation sequencing technology, we examined the temporal changes in the landscape of the patients immunological status, and found dramatic changes in the IGH within the patients immune system after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Although different patients have distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, by employing clonotype overlap, lineage expansion and clonotype network analyses, we observed a higher clonotype overlap and substantial lineage expansion of B cell clones during 2-3 weeks of illness, which is of great importance to B-cell immune responses. Meanwhile, for preferences of V gene usage during SARS-CoV-2 infection, IGHV3-74 and IGHV4-34 and IGHV4-39 in COVID-19 patients were more abundant than that of healthy controls.

This peptide corresponds to the sequence 24-42 of the ACE2 1 domain, which is the binding site for the S1 protein. The on-rate and off-rate of S1-ACE2 complex formation were measured in the presence of various peptide concentrations using Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). The formation of the S1-ACE2 complex was inhibited when the S1 protein was preincubated with the peptide, however, no significant inhibitory effect was observed in the absence of preincubation. Dissociation kinetics revealed that the peptide remained bound to the S1-ACE2 complex and stabilized this complex. Computational mapping of the S1 protein surface for peptide binding revealed two additional sites, located at some distance from the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1.

222,Structural dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot reveal topologically distinct conformers,"The RNA pseudoknot that stimulates -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a possible drug target. To understand how this 3-stemmed pseudoknot responds to the mechanical tension applied by ribosomes during translation, which is thought to play a key role during frame-shifting, we probed its structural dynamics under tension using optical tweezers. Unfolding curves revealed that the frameshift signal formed multiple different structures: at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformers with different unfolding forces and energy barriers, as well as alternative stem-loop structures. Refolding curves showed that stem 1 formed first in the pseudoknotted conformers, followed by stem 3 and then stem 2. By extending the handle holding the RNA to occlude the 5' end of stem 1, the proportion of the different pseudoknot conformers could be altered systematically, consistent with structures observed in cryo-EM images and computational simulations that had distinct topologies: the 5' end of the RNA threaded through the 3-helix junction to form a ring-knot, or unthreaded as in more standard H-type pseudoknots.

223,Lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enables analysis of neutralizing activity in COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread around the globe, effective vaccination protocols are under deployment. Alternatively, the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy relies on the transfer of the immunoglobulin repertoire of a donor that has recovered from the disease as a means of passive vaccination. While the lack of an effective antiviral treatment inadvertently increases the interest in CP products, initial clinical evaluation on COVID-19 patients revealed that critical factors determining the outcome of CP therapy need to be defined clearly if clinical efficacy is to be expected. Measurement of neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 using wildtype virus presents a reliable functional assay but the availability of suitable BSL3 facilities for virus culture restricts its applicability. Instead, the use of pseudovirus particles containing elements from the SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely applied to determine the activity of CP or other neutralizing agents such as monoclonal antibodies.

In this study, we present our approach to optimize GFP-encoding lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Membrane proteins for use in neutralization assays. Our results show the feasibility of pseudovirus production using a C-terminal truncated Spike protein which is greatly enhanced by the incorporation of the D614G mutation. Moreover, we report that the use of Sodium Butyrate during lentiviral vector production dramatically increases pseudovirus titers. Analysis of CP neutralizing activity against particles pseudotyped with wildtype or D614G mutant Spike protein in the presence or absence the M protein revealed differential activity in CP samples that did not necessarily correlate with the amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Our results indicate that the extent of neutralizing activity in CP samples depends on the quality rather than the quantity of the humoral immune responses and varies greatly between donors. Functional screening of neutralizing activity using pseudovirus-based neutralization assays must be accepted as a critical tool for choosing CP donors if clinical efficacy is to be maximized.",Cevriye Pamukcu; Elif Celik; Ebru Zeynep Ergun; Zeynep Sena Karahan; Gozde Turkoz; Merkaya Aras; Canan Eren; Uluhan Sili; Huseyin Bilginer; Ilke Suder; Baris Can Mandaci; Baran Dingiloglu; Ozge Tatli; Gizem Dinler Doganay; Safa Baris; Nesrin Ozoren; Tolga Sutlu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424590,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424590,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
224,An Ultrasensitive Biosensor for Quantifying the Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and Its Receptor ACE2 in Cells and in vitro,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading and mutating with increasing speed worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a simple, sensitive, and high-throughput (HTP) assay to quantify virus-host interaction in order to quickly evaluate infectious ability of mutant virus and develop or validate virus-inhibiting drugs. Here we have developed an ultrasensitive bioluminescent biosensor to evaluate virus-cell interaction by quantifying the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) both in living cells and in vitro. We have successfully used this novel biosensor to analyze SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants, and evaluated candidate small molecules (SMs), antibodies, and peptides that may block RBD:ACE2 interaction. This simple, rapid and HTP biosensor tool will significantly expedite detection of viral mutants and anti-COVID-19 drug discovery processes.",Lidong Liu; Yee Wah So; Yutian Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424698,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424698,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
225,Maori and Pacific People in New Zealand have higher risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19,"AimsWe aim to quantify differences in clinical outcomes from COVID-19 infection by ethnicity with a focus on risk of hospitalisation.

MethodsWe used data on age, ethnicity, deprivation index, pre-existing health conditions, and clinical outcomes on 1,829 COVID-19 cases reported in New Zealand. We used a logistic regression model to calculate odds ratios for the risk of hospitalisation by ethnicity. We also consider length of hospital stay and risk of fatality.

ResultsM[a]ori have 2.5 times greater odds of hospitalisation than non-M[a]ori, non-Pacific people, after controlling for age and pre-existing conditions. Similarly, Pacific people have 3 times greater odds.

ConclusionsStructural inequities and systemic racism in the healthcare system mean that M[a]ori and Pacific communities face a much greater health burden from COVID-19. Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions are also at greater risk.

226,Can age-distribution be an indicator of the goodness of COVID-19 testing?,"It has been evident that the faster, more accurate, and more comprehensive testing can help policymakers assess the real impact of COVID-19 and help them with when and how strict the mitigation policies should be. Nevertheless, the exact number of infected ones could not be measured due to the lack of comprehensive testing. In this paper, first of all, we will investigate the relation of transmission of COVID-19 with age by observing timed data in multiple countries. Then, we compare the COVID-19 CFR with the age-demography data. and as a result, we have proposed a method for estimating a lower bound for the number of positive cases by using the reported data on the oldest age group and the regions population age-distributions. The proposed estimation method improved the expected similarity between the age-distribution of positive cases and regions populations. Thus, using the publicly accessible data for several developed countries, we show how the improvement of testing over the course of several months has made it clear for the community that different age groups are equally prone to becoming COVID positive. The result shows that the age demography of COVID-19 gets similar to the age-demography of the population, together with the reduction of CFR over time. In addition, countries with less CFR have more similar COVID-19s age-distribution, which is caused by more comprehensive testing, than ones who have higher CFR. This leads us to a better estimation for positive cases in different testing strategies. Having knowledge of this fact helps policymakers enforce more effective policies for controlling the spread of the virus.",Amirhoshang Hoseinpour Dehkordi; Reza Nemati; Pouya Tavousi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248690,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248690,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,True
227,MHC-II constrains the natural neutralizing antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBM in humans,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies develop within two weeks of infection, but wane relatively rapidly post-infection, raising concerns about whether antibody responses will provide protection upon re-exposure. Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.

228,Emerging SARS-CoV-2 diversity revealed by rapid whole genome sequence typing.,"BackgroundDiscrete classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral genotypes can identify emerging strains and detect geographic spread, viral diversity, and transmission events.

MethodsWe developed a tool (GNUVID) that integrates whole genome multilocus sequence typing and a supervised machine learning random forest-based classifier. We used GNUVID to assign sequence type (ST) profiles to each of 69,686 SARS-CoV-2 complete, high-quality genomes available from GISAID as of October 20th 2020. STs were then clustered into clonal complexes (CCs), and then used to train a machine learning classifier. We used this tool to detect potential introduction and exportation events, and to estimate effective viral diversity across locations and over time in 16 US states.

ResultsGNUVID is a scalable tool for viral genotype classification (available at https://github.com/ahmedmagds/GNUVID) that can be used to quickly process tens of thousands of genomes. Our genotyping ST/CC analysis uncovered dynamic local changes in ST/CC prevalence and diversity with multiple replacement events in different states. We detected an average of 20.6 putative introductions and 7.5 exportations for each state. Effective viral diversity dropped in all states as shelter-in-place travel-restrictions went into effect and increased as restrictions were lifted. Interestingly, our analysis showed correlation between effective diversity and the date that state-wide mask mandates were imposed.

ConclusionsOur classification tool uncovered multiple introduction and exportation events, as well as waves of expansion and replacement of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in different states. Combined with future genomic sampling the GNUVID system could be used to track circulating viral diversity and identify emerging clones and hotspots.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424582,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424582,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
229,Losartan promotes cell survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be associated with mortality and high morbidity worldwide. There is an extensive effort to control infection and disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study addressed the hypothesis that angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, Losartan, may restrict pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2 by decreasing viral-induced cytopathological changes by blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), thus reducing the affinity of the virus for ACE2, and inhibiting papain-like protease of the virus.

MethodLosartan inhibitory effect on deubiquitination and deISGylation properties of papain-like protease was investigated using a fluorescence method and gel shift analysis determining its inhibitory effects.

The inhibitory effect of Losartan on SARS-CoV-2 cell replication was investigated both when losartan was added to the cell culture 1 hour before (pre-infection group) and 1 hour after (post-infection group) SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells.

ResultsLosartan treatment of Vero E6 cells prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication by 80% and 70% respectively. Losartan was not a strong deubiquitinase and deISGylase inhibitor of PLpro.

ConclusionLosartan added pre- and post-infection to the Vero E6 cell culture significantly prevents cell destruction and replication by SARS-CoV2. Losartan has low side-effects, is readily available, and can be produced at high levels globally, all features of a promising drug in treatment of COVID-19 if validated by clinical trials.",Reza Nejat; Ahmad Shahir Sadr; Brendan T.

230,Human neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 require intact Fc effector functions and monocytes for optimal therapeutic protection,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although passively delivered neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show promise in clinical trials, their mechanism of action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we define correlates of protection of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes for therapeutic efficacy. Thus, potently neutralizing mAbs require Fc effector functions for maximal therapeutic benefit during therapy to modulate protective immune responses and mitigate lung disease.",Emma S.

231,SARS-CoV-2 escape in vitro from a highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"To investigate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the immune population, we co-incubated authentic virus with a highly neutralizing plasma from a COVID-19 convalescent patient. The plasma fully neutralized the virus for 7 passages, but after 45 days, the deletion of F140 in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) N3 loop led to partial breakthrough. At day 73, an E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) occurred, followed at day 80 by an insertion in the NTD N5 loop containing a new glycan sequon, which generated a variant completely resistant to plasma neutralization. Computational modeling predicts that the deletion and insertion in loops N3 and N5 prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies. The recent emergence in the United Kingdom and South Africa of natural variants with similar changes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to escape an effective immune response and that vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants should be developed.

232,SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and transmission efficiency is increased for airborne but not fomite exposure in Syrian hamsters,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by contact, fomite, and airborne transmission. The relative contribution of different transmission routes remains subject to debate. Here, we show Syrian hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through intranasal, aerosol and fomite exposure. Different routes of exposure presented with distinct disease manifestations. Intranasal and aerosol inoculation caused more severe respiratory pathology, higher virus loads and increased weight loss. Fomite exposure led to milder disease manifestation characterized by an anti-inflammatory immune state and delayed shedding pattern. Whereas the overall magnitude of respiratory virus shedding was not linked to disease severity, the onset of shedding was. Early shedding was linked to an increase in disease severity. Airborne transmission was more efficient than fomite transmission and dependent on the direction of the airflow. Carefully characterized of SARS-CoV-2 transmission models will be crucial to assess potential changes in transmission and pathogenic potential in the light of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",Julia R Port; Claude Kwe Yinda; Irene Offei Owusu; Myndi Holbrook; Robert J Fischer; Trenton J Bushmaker; Victoria A Avanzato; Jonathan E Schulz; Neeltje van Doremalen; Chad Clancy; Vincent Munster,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424565,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424565,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
233,SPINT2 controls SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and is associated to disease severity,"COVID-19 outbreak is the biggest threat to human health in recent history. Currently, there are over 1.5 million related deaths and 75 million people infected around the world (as of 22/12/2020). The identification of virulence factors which determine disease susceptibility and severity in different cell types remains an essential challenge. The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. SPINT2 is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between SPINT2/TMPRSS2 and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that SPINT2 negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after SPINT2 knockdown. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases.",Carlos Ramirez; Ashwini Kumar Sharma; Carmon Kee; Leonie Thomas; Steeve Boulant; Carl Herrmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424029,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424029,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
234,Analysis and Forecasting of Global of RT-PCR Primers for SARS-CoV-2,"Rapid tests for active SARS-CoV-2 infections rely on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR uses reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA (primer and probe) targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The technology makes rapid and specific identification of the virus possible based on sequence homology of nucleic acid sequence and is much faster than than tissue culture or animal cell models. However the technique can lose sensitivity over time as the virus evolves and the target sequences diverge from the selective primer sequences. As we rely on existing RT-PCR primers to track and manage the spread of the Coronavirus as public life re-opens, it is imperative to understand how SARS-CoV-2 mutations, over time and geographically, diverge from existing primers used today. In this study, we analyze the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 primers in use today by measuring the number of mismatches between primer sequence and genome targets over time and spatially. We find that there is a growing number of mismatches, an increase by 2% per month, as well as a high specificity of virus based on geographic location.",Gowri Nayar; Ed Seabolt; Mark Kunitomi; Akshay Agarwal; Kristen L.

235,Rapid inactivation in vitro of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva by black tea and green tea,"Saliva plays major roles in human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Recently we reported that black, green and oolong tea significantly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 1 min. Theaflavin-3,3-di-gallate (TFDG), theasinensin A (TSA) and (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were involved in the anti-viral activities. Here we examined how long period is required for the compounds to inactivate the virus. We also assessed whether tea inactivates SARS-CoV-2 diluted in human saliva. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with 500 M TFDG or TSA for 10 sec reduced the virus titer to undetectable levels (less than 1/1,000). Black and green tea decreased virus titer to less than 1/100 within 10 sec even in saliva. These findings suggest a possibility that intake of, or gargling with, tea may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in saliva in infected individuals, which may eventually attenuate spread of COVID-19 within a population, although clinical studies are required to test this hypothesis by determining the intensity and duration of the anti-viral effect of tea in saliva in humans.",Eriko Ohgitani; Masaharu Shin-Ya; Masaki Ichitani; Makoto Kobayashi; Takanobu Takihara; Masaya Kawamoto; Hitoshi Kinugasa; Osam Mazda,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424533,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.424533,2020-12-28,2020-12-28,,False
236,Quantifying the online news media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, mask wearing and social distancing have been the primary measures to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is strong population wide adherence which needs to be facilitated by information on the current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. Here we address the issue of communication on the pandemic by offering data and analysis of online news media coverage of COVID-19.

MethodsWe collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available at http://sciride.org). Using topic detection we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage pandemic received in 2020. Sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 articles to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations.

FindingsWe find that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-speaking sources reveals that the overall COVID-19 coverage cannot be simply classified as negative due to the disease subject matter, suggesting a wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-speaking articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear or crisis.

InterpretationThe goal of pandemic public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and maximize the impact of any governmental policy. Our results suggest an information overload in COVID-19 reporting that could risk obscuring effective policy communication.

237,S-variant SARS-CoV-2 is associated with significantly higher viral loads in samples tested by ThermoFisher TaqPath RT-PCR,"Birmingham University Turnkey laboratory is part of the Lighthouse network responsible for testing clinical samples under the UK government  Test & Trace scheme. Samples are analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples using the Thermofisher TaqPath RT-QPCR test, which is designed to co-amplify sections of three SARS-CoV-2 viral genes.

Since more recent information became available regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (S-VoC), which can show a suboptimal profile in RT-QPCR tests such as the ThermoFisher TaqPath used at the majority of Lighthouse laboratories, we analysed recently published data for trends and significance of the S-gene  dropout variant.

Results showed that:

O_LIthe population of S-gene dropout samples had significantly lower median Ct values of ORF and N-gene targets compared to samples where S-gene was detected
C_LIO_LIon a population basis, S-gene dropout samples clustered around very low Ct values for ORF and N targets
C_LIO_LIlinked Ct values for individual samples showed that a low Ct for ORF and N were clearly associated with an S-dropout characteristic
C_LIO_LIwhen conservatively inferring relative viral load from Ct values, approximately 35% of S-dropout samples had high viral loads between 10 and 10,000-fold greater than 1 x 106, compared to 10% of S-positive samples.

238,Salivary SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection: a prospective cohort study,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 quick testing and reporting are now considered relevant for the containment of new pandemic waves. Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful. We compared the diagnostic performance of salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care (POC) immunochromatographic assays, with that of molecular testing.

Methods234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.

ResultsThe overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the first week from symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing between positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC=0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva had an overall good accuracy (ROC-AUC=0.805, 95%CI:0.740-0.870), reaching the optimal value within 7 days from symptom onset (Sensitivity: 72%; Specificity: 97%). POC antigen in saliva had a very limited sensitivity (13%), performing better in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively), depending on viral loads.

ConclusionsSelf-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection not only by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, for which the highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved in the first week from symptom onset. Saliva is not suitable for POC, although the accuracy of these tests appears satisfactory for NPS with high viral load.",Daniela Basso; Ada Aita; Andrea Padoan; Chiara Cosma; Filippo Navaglia; Stefania Moz; Nicole Contran; Carlo-Federico Zambon; Anna Maria Cattelan; Mario Plebani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248825,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248825,2020-12-27,2020-12-27,,True

However, the role of nasal bacteria in the induction of the virus-specific adaptive immunity is less clear. Here we demonstrate that while intranasal administration of influenza virus hemagglutinin vaccine alone was insufficient to induce the vaccine-specific antibody responses, disruption of nasal bacteria by lysozyme or addition of culturable oral bacteria from a healthy human volunteer rescued inability of the nasal bacteria to generate antibody responses to intranasally administered the split-virus vaccine. Myd88-depdnent signaling in the hematopoietic compartment was required for adjuvant activity of intranasally administered oral bacteria. In addition, we found that the oral bacteria-combined intranasal vaccine induced protective antibody response to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, the virus sequencing data in minks were analysed and compared to those of human-virus. Although the mink-virus maintained the characteristics of human-virus, some variants rapidly mutated, adapting to minks. Some mink-derived variants infected humans, which accounted for 40% of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases in the Netherlands. These variants appear to be less lethal and infective compared to those in humans. Variants that have mutated further among minks were not found in humans.

241,The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein recognition by the human 14-3-3 proteins,"The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) controls viral genome packaging and contains numerous phosphorylation sites located within unstructured regions. Phosphorylated SARS-CoV N was shown to bind to the host 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm. Proteomic data indicate that seven human 14-3-3 proteins are highly abundant in human tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, collectively reaching ~1.8% of all proteins in the lungs, ~1.4% in the gastrointestinal system, ~2.3% in the nervous system. Although the association between 14-3-3 and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins can represent one of the key host-pathogen interactions, its mechanism and the specific critical phosphosites were unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N protein (pN) dimers, reconstituted via bacterial co-expression with protein kinase A, directly associate, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with the dimeric 14-3-3 protein hub, but not with its monomeric mutant. We demonstrate that pN is recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with various efficiencies and determine the apparent KD to selected isoforms in a low micromolar range. Serial truncations pinpointed a critical phosphorylation site to Ser197, located within the SR-rich region of N. The tight 14-3-3/pN association suggests it could regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N, while hijacking cellular pathways by 14-3-3 sequestration. As such, the assembly may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.",Kristina V Tugaeva; Dorothy E. D. P. Hawkins; Jake L. R.

242,The neutralization effect of Montelukast on SARS-CoV-2 is shown by multiscale in silico simulations and combined in vitro studies,"Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 M concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.",Serdar Durdagi; Timucin Avsar; Muge Didem Orhan; Muge Serhatli; Bertan Koray Balcioglu; Hasan Umit Ozturk; Alisan Kayabolen; Yuksel Cetin; Seyma Aydinlik; Tugba Bagci-Onder; Saban Tekin; Hasan Demirci; Mustafa Guzel; Atilla Akdemir; Seyma Calis; Lalehan Oktay; Ilayda Tolu; Yasar Enes Butun; Ece Erdemoglu; Alpsu Olkan; Nurettin Tokay; Seyma Isik; Aysenur Ozcan; Elif Acar; Sehriban Buyukkilic; Yesim Yumak,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424423,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424423,2020-12-27,2020-12-27,,False
243,"Genomic characterization of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","In this study, we report the sequencing of 180 new viral genomes obtained from different municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro from April to December 2020. We identified a novel lineage of SARS-CoV-2, originated from B.1.1.28, distinguished by five single-nucleotide variants (SNVs): C100U, C28253U, G28628U, G28975U, and C29754U. The SNV G23012A (E484K), in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein, was widely spread across the samples. This mutation was previously associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This novel lineage emerged in late July being first detected by us in late October and still mainly restricted to the capital of the state. However, as observed for other strains it can be rapidly spread in the state. The significant increase in the frequency of this lineage raises concerns about public health management and continuous need for genomic surveillance during the second wave of infections.

From January 11 - April 22, 2020, Public Health Ontario conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing of 86,942 specimens collected from 80,354 individuals, primarily using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods. We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple same-day and multi-day collected specimens. Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 Ct lower (SE=0.5, p<0.001). Same-day specimens showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median Ct of multi-day specimens increased over time. Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 Ct (SE=0.5, p<0.001) lower than asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases.

245,Mechanical ventilation affects respiratory microbiome of COVID-19 patients and its interactions with the host,"Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence suggests that the microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n=58) and lower (n=35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We found that time in the intensive care unit and the type of oxygen support explained the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, dwarfing (non-significant) effects from viral load, disease severity, and immune status. Specifically, mechanical ventilation was linked to altered community structure, lower species- and higher strain-level diversity, and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients identified increased oral microbiota compared to controls. These oral microbiota were found physically associated with proinflammatory immune cells, which showed higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.",Verónica Lloréns-Rico; Ann C.

246,Changes in inflammatory and immune drivers in response to immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19,"As the global community strives to discover effective therapies for COVID-19, immunomodulatory strategies have emerged as a leading contender to combat the cytokine storm and improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe disease. Systemic corticosteroids and selective cytokine inhibitory agents have been utilized both as empiric therapies and in clinical trials. While multiple randomized, placebo controlled trials have now demonstrated that corticosteroids improve survival in patients with COVID-19,1, 2 IL-6 inhibition, which gained significant early interest based on observational studies, has not demonstrated reliable efficacy in randomized, placebo controlled trials.3, 4 To better understand the mechanistic basis of immunomodulatory therapies being implemented for treatment of COVID-19, we assessed longitudinal biochemical changes in response to such approaches in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We demonstrate broad suppression of multiple immunomodulatory factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 in patients who received corticosteroids, but no such response was seen in patients who either received tocilizumab or no immunomodulatory therapy.

247,"Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during 9-months of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden","Structured abstractO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSAs Sweden did not enforce social lockdown in response to the pandemic, it is critical to establish seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy, active adults - here represented by blood donors and pregnant women. Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the countrys most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of population seropositivity in response to natural infection.

DesignIn this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n=2,100) and pregnant women (n=2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three intervals) between 14th March and 11th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large cohort of historical controls (n=595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807.

SettingHealthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through the Karolinska University Hospital.

ParticipantsNone of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the samples.

ResultsBlood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened (n=56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response.

ConclusionsIn agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2.

General abstractPublic health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world. In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n=4,100) were sampled at random between 14th March-11th December 2020. All individuals (n=200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results were compared with those from historical controls (n=595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9 months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the end of 2020.",Xaquin C Dopico; Sandra Muschiol; Murray Christian; Leo Hanke; Daniel J Sheward; Nastasiya F Grinberg; Gordana Bogdanovic; Gerald Mcinerney; Tobias Allander; Chris Wallace; Ben Murrell; Jan Albert; Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248821,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248821,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
248,MHC Haplotyping of SARS-CoV-2 patients: HLA subtypes are not associated with the presence and severity of Covid-19 in the Israeli population,"HLA haplotypes were found to be associated with increased risk for viral infections or disease severity in various diseases, including SARS. Several genetic variants are associated with Covid-19 severity. However, no clear association between HLA and Covid-19 incidence or severity has been reported. We conducted a large scale HLA analysis of Israeli individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Overall, 72,912 individuals with known HLA haplotypes were included in the study, of whom 6,413 (8.8%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. a Total of 20,937 subjects were of Ashkenazi origin (at least 2/4 grandparents). One hundred eighty-one patients (2.8% of the infected) were hospitalized due to the disease. None of the 66 most common HLA loci (within the five HLA subgroups; A, B, C, DQB1, DRB1) was found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization. Similarly, no association was detected in the Ashkenazi Jewish subset. Moreover, no association was found between heterozygosity in any of the HLA loci and either infection or hospitalization.

249,Does COVID-19 Testing Create More Cases? An Empirical Evidence on the Importance of Mass Testing During a Pandemic,"The importance of testing and surveillance of an infectious disease cannot be underestimated. The testing is the first step to detect an infectious disease, and mass testing can slow or mitigate the spread of an infectious disease. Despite overwhelming evidence and the importance of testing discussed in the literature, there have been claims that ""more COVID-19 testing creates more cases"". Therefore, there is a need to study whether massive testing is the reason for detecting more positive COVID-19 cases. In this research, we used a dataset from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and empirically showed that by increasing the COVID-19 testing in the U.S., the spread of the COVID-19 decreased significantly. Our results indicate a negative relationship between the number of positive cases and the number of tests performed in the past months. The large-scale testing may have helped identify positive and asymptomatic cases early in the course of illness, which enabled individuals to isolate themselves, thus reducing the chances of spreading the diseases and slowing the spread of the pandemic.",Ali Ahmed,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248740,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248740,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
250,Oral clarithromycin in COVID-19 of moderate severity: the ACHIEVE open-label trial using concurrent matched comparators,"BackgroundClarithromycin clinical efficacy has not been described in COVID-19.

Research questionIs oral clarithromycin beneficial for treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19?

Study and methodsAn open-label non-randomized trial in 90 patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity was conducted at four study sites in Greece between May and October 2020. Ninety participants with respiratory tract infections received clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours for 7 days; another 90 standard-of-care (SOC) propensity score-matched concurrent controls received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine. The composite primary endpoint was defined for patients with upper respiratory tract infection as: (a) no need for hospital re-admission or (b) lack of progression into lower respiratory tract infection and, for patients with lower respiratory tract infection, as at least 50% decrease of the score of respiratory symptoms at the end-of-treatment (EOT) without progression into severe respiratory failure (SRF). The incidence SRF at the test-of-cure (TOC) on day 14 was a secondary endpoint. For clarithromycin-treated patients, viral load of SARS-CoV-2, biomarkers, the function of mononuclear cells, and safety were assessed; biomarkers were also measured in SOC comparators.

ResultsThe primary endpoint was attained in 86.7% of patients treated with clarithromycin (95% CIs 78.1-92.2%) and 73.3% of concurrent SOC comparators (95%CIs; 63.4-81.4%). The odds ratio for the primary endpoint with clarithromycin treatment in univariate analysis was 2.36 (95%CIs 1.09-5.08; P: 0.039). Results were confirmed after multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 3.30; 95% CI 1.10-9.87; P: 0.033). At the TOC visit, the incidence of SRF was 12.2% (n = 11 ; 95%CIs 6.9-20.6%) among patients treated with clarithromycin (odds ratio for SRF 0.38; 95%CIs 0.17-0.84) versus 26.7% (n= 24; 95%CIs 18.6-36.6%) among concurrent SOC comparators (P: 0.023). Clarithromycin use was associated with decreases in circulating levels of C-reactive protein, of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and of interleukin (IL)-6; by an increase of the ratio of Th1 to Th2 mononuclear responses; and by suppression of SARS-CoV-2 relative viral load. No safety concerns were reported. Patients starting clarithromycin with the first five days from symptoms onset achieved better responses.

InterpretationClarithromycin treatment is associated with early clinical improvement in patients with moderate COVID-19. Modulation of the Th1/Th2 responses is proposed as the mechanism of action.

251,Association between Use of Qingfei Paidu Tang and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A national retrospective registry study,"BackgroundQingfei Paidu Tang (QPT), a formula of traditional Chinese medicine, which was suggested to be able to ease symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been recommended by clinical guidelines and widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, whether it decreases mortality remains unknown.

PurposeWe aimed to explore the association between QPT use and in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

Study designA retrospective study based on a real-world database was conducted.

MethodsWe identified patients consecutively hospitalized with COVID-19 in 15 hospitals from a national retrospective registry in China, from January through May 2020. Data on patients characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from the electronic medical records. The association of QPT use with mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models based on propensity score analysis.

ResultsOf the 8939 patients included, 28.7% received QPT. The crude mortality was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8% to 1.7%) among the patients receiving QPT and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3% to 5.3%) among those not receiving QPT. After adjustment for patient characteristics and concomitant treatments, QPT use was associated with a relative reduction of 50% in in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66 P <0.001). This association was consistent across subgroups by sex and age. Meanwhile, the incidence of acute liver injury (8.9% [95% CI, 7.8% to 10.1%]vs. 9.9% [95% CI, 9.2% to 10.7%]; odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.81% to 1.14%], P =0.658) and acute kidney injury (1.6% [95% CI, 1.2% to 2.2%] vs. 3.0% [95% CI, 2.6% to 3.5%]; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17], P =0.318) was comparable between patients receiving QPT and those not receiving QPT. The major study limitations included that the study was an observational study based on real-world data rather than a randomized control trial, and the quality of data could be affected by the accuracy and completeness of medical records.

253,Prognostic and predictive biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab in a randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundRetrospective observational studies suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, D-dimer, and platelets are associated with disease progression, treatment outcomes, or both, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We explored these candidate prognostic and predictive biomarkers with efficacy outcomes after treatment with tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody using data from the COVACTA trial for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

MethodsCandidate biomarkers were measured in 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 142 patients in the placebo arm. Efficacy outcomes assessed were clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharge; 7, death), mortality, time to hospital discharge, and mechanical ventilation (if not receiving it at randomisation) through day 28. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers were evaluated continuously with proportional odds, binomial or Fine-Gray models, and additional sensitivity analyses.

FindingsModelling in the placebo arm showed all candidate biomarkers except LDH and D-dimer were strongly prognostic for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical status, and time to hospital discharge. Modelling in the tocilizumab arm showed a predictive value of ferritin for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality (predictive interaction p=0.03), mechanical ventilation (predictive interaction p=0.01), and clinical status (predictive interaction p=0.02) compared with placebo.

InterpretationMultiple biomarkers prognostic for clinical outcomes were confirmed in COVACTA. Ferritin was identified as a predictive biomarker for the effects of tocilizumab in the COVACTA patient population; high ferritin levels were associated with better clinical outcomes for tocilizumab compared with placebo at day 28.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Evidence before this studyThe efficacy and safety of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in the treatment of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia was investigated in COVACTA, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint of improved clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death) at day 28 was not met in this trial. Among the secondary endpoints, no difference in mortality at day 28 was observed, but time to hospital discharge was shorter in the tocilizumab group. Subgroup analysis suggested there might be a treatment benefit in patients grouped according to their ordinal scale category at baseline.

We searched PubMed on September 14, 2020, using the terms ""tocilizumab AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus) AND biomarker"" with no language or date restrictions. The search retrieved 18 articles, four of which identified laboratory measures as potential biomarkers in patients who received tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. The biomarkers reported in these studies include interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, liver transaminases, lymphocytes, platelets, and D-dimer. However, these previous studies were single-centre, retrospective, observational studies. Larger, prospective, controlled trials are needed to investigate potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers to assess the outcomes and response to treatments for COVID-19.

Added value of this studyThis exploratory analysis of data from COVACTA demonstrated interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, neutrophils (percentage and absolute count), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocytes (percentage and absolute count), monocytes (percentage), and platelets as strong prognostic biomarkers in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. More important, ferritin showed predictive value for tocilizumab treatment effects on day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation (among the subgroup of patients not receiving mechanical ventilation at randomisation), and clinical status compared with placebo.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn patients with elevated levels of ferritin at baseline, tocilizumab decreased the probability of death, mechanical ventilation, and worsening clinical status at day 28 compared with placebo, suggesting that ferritin might be useful as a predictive biomarker of efficacy outcomes for tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.",Jennifer Tom; Min Bao; Larry Tsai; Aditi Qamra; David Summers; Montserrat Carrasco-Triguero; Jacqueline McBride; Carrie M Rosenberger; Celia J F Lin; William Stubbings; Kevin G Blyth; Jordi Carratala; Bruno Francois; Thomas Benfield; Derrick Haslem; Paolo Bonfanti; Cor H van der Leest; Nidhi Rohatgi; Lothar Wiese; Charles Edouard Luyt; Farrah Kheradmand; Ivan O Rosas; Fang Cai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20247379,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20247379,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
254,Characteristic spatial scales of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics: lessons from mass rapid antigen testing in Slovakia,"Mass antigen testing in Slovakia conducted in October and November 2020 is a source of important data. We perform its statistical analysis and study epidemic geographical patterns. We observe exponentially distributed test positivity and exponential trends in its geographical distribution, and its approximately 10 km spatial characteristic correlation length. A small correlation between positivity in two consecutive testing rounds appeared on the municipalities level but it significantly increased on the counties level. Recent 7-day PCR tests incidence per capita served as a good proxy for antigen test positivity.

255,Support and follow-up needs of patients discharged from Intensive Care after severe COVID-19: a mixed-methods study of the views of UK general practitioners and intensive care staff during the pandemic's first wave,"BackgroundAfter discharge from an intensive care unit(ICU), over 50% of patients face significant physical, mental and cognitive problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large cohort of these patients who will need follow-up services that can address their support needs.

ObjectivesTo identify follow-up services planned for COVID-19 patients discharged from ICU, and to explore the views of ICU staff and General Practitioners(GPs) regarding these patients future needs and care coordination.

DesignSequential mixed-methods UK study. We explored usual follow-up practice after ICU discharge and changes in follow-up during the pandemic through a survey of ICU staff, and GP awareness of follow-up and support needs of patients discharged from ICU through a survey of GPs. Through these surveys, we identified participants for semi-structured interviews with both groups.

ResultsWe obtained 170 survey responses and conducted 23 interviews. Over 60% of GPs were unaware of the follow-up services generally provided by their local hospitals, and whether or not these were functioning during the pandemic. Eighty percent of ICUs reported some form of follow-up services, with 25% of these suspending provision during the peak of the pandemic, and over half modifying their provision (usually to provide the service remotely). Complex funding streams, poor communication between primary and secondary care, and lack of clarity about who was responsible for referrals and follow-up were the most common problems identified. Discharge documentation was described as poor and lacking key information. Both groups mentioned difficulties accessing services in the community.

ConclusionsThe pandemic has highlighted long-standing issues of continuity of care and complex funding streams for post-ICU follow-up care. The large cohort of ICU patients admitted due to COVID-19 highlights the need for improved follow-up services and communication between specialists and GPs, not only for COVID-19 patients, but for all those discharged from ICU.

Our analysis suggests that a number of genetic variants associated with immune escape have emerged in global populations.,Bani Jolly; Mercy Rophina; Afra Shamnath; Mohamed Imran; Rahul C Bhoyar; Mohit Kumar Divakar; Pallavali Roja Rani; Gyan Ranjan; Paras Sehgal; Pulala Chandrasekhar; S Afsar; J Vijaya Lakshmi; A Surekha; Sridhar Sivasubbu; Vinod Scaria,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424332,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424332,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
257,Differential Dynamic Behavior of Prefusion Spike Proteins of SARS Coronaviruses 1 and 2,"Within the last two decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) have caused two major outbreaks. For reasons yet to be fully understood the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been significantly more widespread than the 2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-1, despite striking similarities between the two viruses. One of the most variable genes differentiating SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is the S gene that encodes the spike glycoprotein. This protein mediates a crucial step in the infection, i.e., host cell recognition and viral entry, which starts with binding to the host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for both viruses. Recent structural and functional studies have shed light on the differential binding behavior of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. In particular, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies show that ACE2 binding is preceded by a large-scale conformational change in the spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain (RBD) to its binding partner. Unfortunately, these studies do not provide detailed information on the dynamics of this activation process. Here, we have used an extensive set of unbiased and biased microsecond-timescale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomains in explicit solvent to determine the differential behavior of spike protein activation in the two viruses. Our results based on nearly 50 microseconds of equilibrium and nonequilibrium MD simulations indicate that the active form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is considerably more stable than the active SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Unlike the active SARS-CoV-2 spike, the active SARS-CoV-1 spike spontaneously undergoes a large-scale conformational transition to a pseudo-inactive state, which occurs in part due to interactions between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD that are absent in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Steered MD (SMD) simulations indicate that the energy barriers between active and inactive states are comparatively lower for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the greater propensity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to remain in the active conformation contributes to the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1. These results strongly suggest that the differential binding behavior of the active SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins is not merely due to differences in their RBDs as other domains of the spike protein such as the NTD could play a crucial role in the effective binding process, which involves the prebinding activation. Therefore, our hypothesis predicts that mutations in regions such as the NTD, which is not directly involved in binding, may lead to a change in the effective binding behavior of the coronavirus.",Vivek Govind Kumar; Dylan S Ogden; Ugochi Isu; Adithya Polasa; James Losey; Mahmoud Moradi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.424008,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.424008,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
258,Influence of HLA class II polymorphism on predicted cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 at the population and individual level,"Development of effective adaptive immune responses after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is predicated on recognition of viral peptides, presented in the context of HLA class II molecules, by CD4+ T-cells. We capitalised on extensive high resolution HLA data deposited in the National Marrow Donor Program registry to obtain detailed information on human HLA haplotype frequencies of twenty five human populations and used a bioinformatics approach to investigate the role of HLA polymorphism on SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity at the population and at the individual level. Within populations, we identify wide inter-individual variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity against structural, non-structural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to expressed HLA genotype. However, we find similar potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity at the population level, across all ethnic groups examined, suggesting that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after COVID-19 among different race and ethnic groups. We predict robust immune reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the basis for the majority of current vaccination efforts, both at the population and individual level, despite significant variation in Spike-derived peptide presentation by individual HLA genotypes. Finally, we provide comprehensive maps of SARS-CoV-2 proteome immunogenicity accounting for population coverage in major ethnic groups. Our findings provide important insight on the potential role of HLA polymorphism on development of protective immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination and a firm basis for further experimental studies in this field.",Hannah Charlotte Copley; Loren Gragert; Andrew R Leach; Vasilis Kosmoliaptsis,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424326,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424326,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
259,"TCR meta-clonotypes for biomarker discovery with tcrdist3: quantification of public, HLA-restricted TCR biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection","As the mechanistic basis of adaptive cellular antigen recognition, T cell receptors (TCRs) encode clinically valuable information that reflects prior antigen exposure and potential future response. However, despite advances in deep repertoire sequencing, enormous TCR diversity complicates the use of TCR clonotypes as clinical biomarkers. We propose a new framework that leverages antigen-enriched repertoires to form meta-clonotypes - groups of biochemically similar TCRs - that can be used to robustly quantify functionally similar TCRs in bulk repertoires. We apply the framework to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1,915 public TCR meta-clonotypes from the 18 SARS-CoV-2 antigen-enriched repertoires with the strongest evidence of HLA-restriction. Applied to independent cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact amino acid matches, and 44% (845/1915) were significantly enriched among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting HLA allele, demonstrating the potential utility of meta-clonotypes as antigen-specific features for biomarker development. To enable further applications, we developed an open-source software package, tcrdist3, that implements this framework and facilitates workflows for distance-based TCR repertoire analysis.",Koshlan Mayer-Blackwell; Philip Harlan Bradley; Andrew Fiore-Gartland,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424260,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424260,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
260,Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 can be accelerated by a mutation in the nsp14 gene,"Nucleotide substitution rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is relatively low compared to the other RNA viruses because coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 encode non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) that is an error-correcting exonuclease protein. In this study, to understand genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic, we examined mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 which could inhibit its error-correcting function. First, to obtain functionally important sites of nsp14, we examined 62 representative coronaviruses belonging to alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and unclassified coronaviruses. As a result, 99 out of 527 amino acid sites of nsp14 were evolutionarily conserved. We then examined nsp14 sequences obtained from 28,082 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified 6 amino acid changes in nsp14 mutants that were not detected in the 62 representative coronaviruses. We examined genome substitution rates of these mutants and found that an nsp14 mutant with a proline to leucine change at position 203 (P203L) showed a higher substitution rate (35.9 substitutions/year) than SARS-CoV-2 possessing wild-type nsp14 (19.8 substitutions/year). We confirmed that the substitution rate of the P203L is significantly higher than those of other variants containing mutations in structural proteins. Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing P203L mutation of nsp14 is limited (26), these mutants appeared at least 10 times independently in the current pandemic. These results indicated that the molecular function of nsp14 is important for survival of various coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and that some mutations such as P203L of nsp14 inhibiting its error-correcting function are removed rapidly due to their deleterious effects.",Kosuke Takada; Mahoko Takahashi Ueda; Tokiko Watanabe; So Nakagawa,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424231,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424231,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False

Here, we present Free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations for the interactions of the spike S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) with both the ACE2 receptor and an antibody derived from COVID-19 patients. Our results shown that the S1 RBD-ACE2 interactions were significantly increased whereas those with the STE90-C11 antibody dramatically decreased; about over 100 times. The K417N mutation had much more pronounced effect and in a combination with N501Y fully abolished the antibody effect.

The main virus induced pathology was in the lung parenchyma and not in the airways. Most coagulation events occurred in the intra-alveolar and not in the intra-vascular space and the few thrombi were mainly composed of aggregated thrombocytes. The dominant inflammatory response was the massive accumulation of CD163+ macrophages and the disappearance of T killer, NK and B-cells. The virus was replicating in the pneumocytes and macrophages but not in bronchial epithelium, endothel, pericytes or stromal cells. The lung consolidations were produced by a massive regenerative response, stromal and epithelial proliferation and neovascularization.

263,Let the DOCTOR Decide Whom to Test: Adaptive Testing Strategies to Tackle the COVID-19 Pandemic,"A robust testing program is necessary for containing the spread of COVID-19 infections before a vaccine becomes available. However, due to an acute shortage of testing kits (especially in low-resource developing countries), designing an optimal testing program/strategy is a challenging problem to solve. Prior literature on testing strategies suffers from two major limitations: (i) it does not account for the trade-off between testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and (ii) it primarily focuses on static testing strategies, which leads to significant shortcomings in the testing programs effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations by making five novel contributions. (i) We formally define the optimal testing problem and propose the DOCTOR POMDP model to tackle it. (ii) We solve the DOCTOR POMDP using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search based algorithm. (iii) We provide a rigorous experimental analysis of DOCTORs testing strategies against static baselines - our results show that when applied to the city of Santiago in Panama, DOCTORs strategies result in [~]40% fewer COVID-19 infections (over one month) as compared to state-of-the-art static baselines. (iv) In addition, we analyze DOCTORs testing policy to derive insights about the reasons behind the optimality of DOCTORs testing policy. (v) Finally, we characterize conditions (of the real world) under which DOCTORs optimization would be of most benefit to government policy makers, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area.

Mutations on the S-RBD may alter its affinity to cell receptor and affect the potency of vaccines and antibodies. Here we used an in-silico approach to predict how mutations on RBD affect its binding affinity to hACE2 (human angiotensin-converting enzyme2). The effect of all single point mutations on the interface was predicted. SPR assay result shows that 6 out of 9 selected mutations can strengthen binding affinity.

266,Extensive High-Order Complexes within SARS-CoV-2 Proteome Revealed by Compartmentalization-Aided Interaction Screening,"Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genome in nature, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes sophisticated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), mainly composed of a network of nonstructural proteins and nucleocapsid protein, to establish efficient infection. Here, we developed an innovative interaction screening strategy based on phase separation in cellulo, namely compartmentalization of protein-protein interactions in cells (CoPIC). Utilizing CoPIC screening, we mapped the interaction network among RTC-related viral proteins. We identified a total of 47 binary interactions among 14 proteins governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses. Further exploration via CoPIC led to the discovery of extensive ternary complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order complexes. Taken together, our results present an efficient, and robust interaction screening strategy, and indicate the existence of a complex interaction network among RTC-related factors, thus opening up new opportunities to understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and develop therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.",Weifan Xu; Gaofeng Pei; Hongrui Liu; Jing Wang; Pilong Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424422,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.424422,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,False
267,A New State-Space Epidemiological Model for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Non-Medical Interventions- A Study on COVID-19 in California and Florida,"In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of infecteds are expected to remain undetected, and hence, are not quarantined. This, in turn, defeats the whole purpose of non-medical containment measures, like quarantine, lockdown, travel ban, physical distancing etc., by keeping the average reproduction rate above 1. To stress upon the importance of extensive random testing for breaking the chains of transmissions, we have formulated a detailed framework for carrying out cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of extensive random testing in comparison to targeted testing (the existing testing policy followed by most countries). This framework can be easily extended for CEA of any other non-medical or even medical interventions for containing epidemics.

We have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered-deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure.

268,Surveillance of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in school children and point-prevalence during a time of high community transmission in Switzerland,"BackgroundSwitzerland had one of the highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Europe during the second wave. Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place. However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes.

Methods14 out of the randomly selected sample of the Ciao Corona cohort study participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections of school children attending primary and secondary school. A buccal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days.

ResultsOut of 1299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least 1 of 2 testings. None of the teachers but 1 child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2% (95% CI 0.0% to 1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7 (0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in a new buccal sample taken 2 hours to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. 35% of children and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing.

ConclusionIn a setting of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures in place (e.g., clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the low point prevalence even in a setting of very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for symptomatic children and school personnel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools.

270,Financial Hardship and Social Assistance as Determinants of Mental Health and Food and Housing Insecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundWhile social assistance through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided expanded UI benefits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic until July 2020, it is unclear whether social assistance was in subsequent months sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb adverse sequelae of financial hardship. Among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic, this study explored the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance.

MethodsUsing multivariable logistic regression and pooled repeated cross-sectional individual-level data on working-aged adults from nationally-representative surveys administered from September to November 2020, this study investigated the relationships between financial hardship and depressive and anxiety symptoms, food insufficiency, and, among housing renters, the likelihood of being evicted, controlling for the receipt of social assistance and other demographic and socioeconomic factors.

ResultsExperiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship) was linked to approximately 3-4 times higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms and a likely eviction, and a 15 times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted a 6-fold higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms, a 24-fold higher odds of a likely eviction, and a more than 50-fold higher odds of food insufficiency (all P values <.001).

ConclusionsEven after accounting for receipt of social assistance, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety or depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship, and more than offset any corresponding benefits from social assistance.

In order to maximise vaccine uptake it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain populations and places.

ObjectiveTo understand peoples Covid-19 beliefs, their interactions with health (mis)information during Covid-19 and attitudes towards a Covid-19 vaccine.

Design and participantsIn-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted.

ResultsParticipants spoke about a wide range of emotive misinformation they had encountered regarding Covid-19, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine.

ConclusionsCovid-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localised and empathetic response to counter misinformation.

Patient or public contributionA rapid community and stakeholder engagement process was undertaken to identify Covid-19 related priority topics important to both Bradford citizens and local decision makers.",Bridget Lockyer; Shahid Islam; Aamnah Rahman; Josie Dickerson; Kate Pickett; Trevor Sheldon; John Wright; Rosemary McEachan; Laura Sheard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248259,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248259,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
272,"Mental health, personality and lifetime psychedelic use during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences represent a major challenge to the mental health and well-being of the general population. Some groups may be more vulnerable than others, depending on factors such as preexisting conditions, personality, and past life experiences. Building on previous work on the potential long-term benefits of psychedelics, we hypothesized that lifetime use of these drugs could be linked to better mental health indicators in the context of the ongoing pandemic.

MethodsTwo anonymous online surveys were conducted between April 2020 and June 2020, including questions about lifetime experience with psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs, and psychometric scales designed to measure personality traits, anxiety, negative and positive affect, well-being and resilience. Principal component analysis was applied to divide the sample into groups of subjects based on their drug use reports.

Results5618 participants (29.15 {+/-} 0.12 years, 71.97% female) completed both surveys and met the inclusion criteria, with 32.43% of the final sample reporting at least one use of a psychedelic drug. Lifetime psychedelic use was linked to increased openness and decreased conscientiousness, and with higher scores of positive affect. The reported number of past psychedelic experiences predicted higher scores of the secondary personality trait beta factor, which has been interpreted as a measure of plasticity. No significant associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and indicators of impaired mental health were observed.

ConclusionWe did not find evidence of an association between lifetime use of psychedelics and poor mental health indicators. Conversely, experience with psychedelic drugs was linked to increased positive affect and to personality traits that favor resilience and stability in the light of the ongoing crisis. Future studies should be conducted to investigate these results from a causal perspective.",Federico Cavanna; Carla Pallavicini; Virginia Milano; Juan Cuiule; Rocco Di Tella; Pablo González; Enzo Tagliazucchi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248519,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248519,2020-12-26,2020-12-26,,True
273,Characterizing Long COVID in an International Cohort: 7 Months of Symptoms and Their Impact,"ObjectiveTo characterize the symptom profile and time course in patients with Long COVID, along with the impact on daily life, work, and return to baseline health.

DesignInternational web-based survey of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020.

SettingSurvey distribution via online COVID-19 support groups and social media

Participants3,762 respondents from 56 countries completed the survey. 1166 (33.7%) were 40-49 years old, 937 (27.1%) were 50-59 years old, and 905 (26.1%) were 30-39 years old. 2961 (78.9%) were women, 718 (19.1%) were men, and 63 (1.7%) were nonbinary. 8.4% reported being hospitalized. 27% reported receiving a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. 96% reported symptoms beyond 90 days.

ResultsPrevalence of 205 symptoms in 10 organ systems was estimated in this cohort, with 66 symptoms traced over seven months. Respondents experienced symptoms in an average of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 9.04 to 9.13) organ systems. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were: fatigue (77.7%, 74.9% to 80.3%), post-exertional malaise (72.2%, 69.3% to 75.0%), and cognitive dysfunction (55.4%, 52.4% to 58.8%). These three symptoms were also the three most commonly reported overall. In those who recovered in less than 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at week 2 (11.4, 9.4 to 13.6), and in those who did not recover in 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at month 2 (17.2, 16.5 to 17.8). Respondents with symptoms over 6 months experienced an average of 13.8 (12.7 to 14.9) symptoms in month 7. 85.9% (84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 45.2% (42.9% to 47.2%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 22.3% (20.5% to 24.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.

ConclusionsPatients with Long COVID report prolonged multisystem involvement and significant disability. Most had not returned to previous levels of work by 6 months.

274,Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England,"A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures.

275,SARS-CoV-2 infecting the inner ear results in potential hearing damage at the early stage or prognosis of COVID-19 in rodents,"ObjectivesIn order to find out the association between the sensorineural hearing loss and COVID-19, we detected the expression ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mouse the hamster.

DesignUsing the public data from NCBI and GISAID, we assessed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the transcriptomic, DNA, and protein levels of ACE2 in the brain, inner ear, and muscle from the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and mouse (Mus musculus).

ResultsWe identified ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressed at different level in the inner ear and brain at DNA and transcriptomic levels of both mouse and the hamster. The protein expression shows a similar pattern of the brain and inner ear, while the expression of ACE2 from the inner ear was relatively higher than it from the muscle.

276,Patterns of within-host genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2,"Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing transmission chains has become a major public health focus for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1,181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within and between host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.",Gerry Tonkin-Hill; Inigo Martincorena; Roberto Amato; Andrew R J Lawson; Moritz Gerstung; Ian Johnston; David K Jackson; Naomi R Park; Stefanie V Lensing; Michael A Quail; Sónia Gonçalves; Cristina Ariani; Michael Spencer Chapman; William L Hamilton; Luke W Meredith; Grant Hall; Aminu S Jahun; Yasmin Chaudhry; Myra Hosmillo; Malte L Pinckert; Iliana Georgana; Anna Yakovleva; Laura G Caller; Sarah L Caddy; Theresa Feltwell; Fahad A Khokhar; Charlotte J Houldcroft; Martin D Curran; Surendra Parmar; - The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium; Alex Alderton; Rachel Nelson; Ewan Harrison; John Sillitoe; Stephen D Bentley; Jeffrey C Barrett; M.

277,A SARS-CoV-2 spike binding DNA aptamer that inhibits pseudovirus infection in vitro by an RBD independent mechanism,"The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2-S) binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2-S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2-S and does not block the interaction of CoV2-S with ACE2. Notwithstanding, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS-CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.",Anton Schmitz; Anna Weber; Mehtap Bayin; Stefan Breuers; Michael Famulok; Gunter Mayer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424171,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424171,2020-12-25,2020-12-25,,False

There is an urgent need for novel antiviral drugs for therapeutic or prophylactic application. Cathepsin L is a key host cysteine protease utilized by coronaviruses for cell entry and is recognized as a promising drug target. The marine natural product, gallinamide A and several synthetic analogues, were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin L activity with IC50 values in the picomolar range. Lead molecules possessed selectivity over cathepsin B and other related human cathepsin proteases and did not exhibit inhibitory activity against viral proteases Mpro and PLpro.

279,Detection and molecular characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed mink (Neovision vision) in Poland,"SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of COVID-19 disease and has been spreading worldwide since December 2019. The virus has been shown to infect different animal species under experimental conditions. Also, minks have been found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in fur farms in Europe and the USA. Here we investigated 91 individual minks from a farm located in Northern Poland. Using RT-PCR, antigen detection and NGS, we confirmed 15 animals positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result was verified by sequencing of full viral genomes, confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection in Polish mink. Country-scale monitoring conducted by veterinary inspection so far has not detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on other mink farms. Taking into consideration that Poland has a high level of positive diagnostic tests among its population, there is a high risk that more Polish mink farms become a source for SARS-CoV-2. Findings reported here and from other fur producing countries urge the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in animals bred in Polish fur farms.",Lukasz Rabalski; Maciej Kosinski; Teemu Smura; Kirsi Aaltonen; Ravi Kant; Tarja Sironen; Boguslaw Szewczyk; Maciej Grzybek,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.422670,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.422670,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,False

281,Real-time monitoring epidemic trends and key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 evolution by an automated tool,"With the global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to monitor the variation, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations of SARS-CoV-2 over time effectively, which is of great significance to the development of new vaccines, the update of therapeutic drugs, and the improvement of detection reagents. The AutoVEM tool developed in the present study could complete all mutations detections, haplotypes classification, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations analysis for 131,576 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in 18 hours on a 1 core CPU and 2G internal storage computer. Through haplotype subgroup epidemic trends analysis of 131,576 genome sequences, the great significance of the previous 4 specific sites (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) was further revealed, and 6 new mutation sites of highly linked (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) were discovered for the first time that might be related to the infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. In brief, we proposed an integrative method and developed an efficient automated tool to monitor haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and screen out the key mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time for the first time, and all data could be updated quickly to track the prevalence of previous key mutations and new key mutations because of high efficiency of the tool.

282,Cell-type apoptosis in lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has inspired renewed interest in understanding the fundamental pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following infection because fatal COVID-19 cases are commonly linked to respiratory failure due to ARDS. The pathologic alteration known as diffuse alveolar damage in endothelial and epithelial cells is a critical feature of acute lung injury in ARDS. However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRAS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown.

In the present study, we examined apoptosis in post-mortem lung sections from COVID-19 patients and lung tissues from a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a cell-type manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and T cells. Multiple-target immunofluorescence (IF) assays and western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (i.e., BEAS2B cells) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infection of co-cultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECs/BEAS2B cells, but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus. Post-exposure treatment of the co-culture of Vero cells and HUVECs with an EPAC1-specific activator ameliorated apoptosis in HUVECs. These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Yakun Liu; Tania M. Garron; Qing Chang; Zhengchen Su; Changcheng Zhou; Eric C.

283,Berberine and obatoclax inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human nasal epithelial cells in vitro,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in late 2019 and has infected an estimated 10% of the global population in less than a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells.

284,Exploring epitope and functional diversity of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies using AI-based methods,"Since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemics, an unprecedented research effort has been conducted to analyze the antibody responses in patients, and many trials based on passive immunotherapy -- notably monoclonal antibodies -- are ongoing. Twenty-one antibodies have entered clinical trials, 6 having reached phase 2/3, phase 3 or having received emergency authorization. These represent only the tip of the iceberg, since many more antibodies have been discovered and represent opportunities either for diagnosis purposes or as drug candidates. The main problem facing laboratories willing to develop such antibodies is the huge task of analyzing them and choosing the best candidate for exhaustive experimental validation. In this work we show how artificial intelligence-based methods can help in analyzing large sets of antibodies in order to determine in a few hours the best candidates in few hours. The MAbCluster method, which only requires knowledge of the amino acid sequences of the antibodies, allows to group the antibodies having the same epitope, considering only their amino acid sequences and their 3D structures (actual or predicted), and to infer some of their functional properties. We then use MAbTope to predict the epitopes for all antibodies for which they are not already known. This allows an exhaustive comparison of the available epitopes, but also gives a synthetic view of the possible combinations. Finally, we show how these results can be used to predict which antibodies might be affected by the different mutations arising in the circulating strains of the virus, such as the N501Y mutation that has started to spread in Great-Britain.",Christophe Dumet; Yann Jullian; Astrid Musnier; Philippe Rivière; Nicolas Poirier; Hervé Watier; Thomas Bourquard; Anne Poupon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424199,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424199,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,False

In Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung injury by SARS-CoV-2 and impaired immune response can provide a favorable environment for microorganism growth and colonization in hospitalized individuals. Recent studies suggest that secondary bacterial pneumonia is a risk factor associated with COVID-19. In Brazil, knowledge about microbiota present in COVID-19 patients is incipient. This work describes the microbiota of 21 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units from two Brazilian centers. We identified respiratory, nosocomial and bacterial pathogens as prevalent microorganisms. Other bacterial opportunistic and commensal species are also represented. Virulence factors of these pathogenic species, metabolic pathways used to evade and modulate immunological processes and the interconnection between bacterial presence and virulence in COVID-19 progression are discussed.

288,"Real-world clinical performance of commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in suspected COVID-19: A systematic meta-analysis of available data as per November 20, 2020","BackgroundImmunochromatographic rapid antigen tests (RATs) emerged onto the COVID-19 pandemic testing landscape to aid in the rapid diagnosis of people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RATs are particularly useful where RT-PCR is not immediately available and symptoms suggestive of a high viral load and infectiousness are assumed. Several lateral flow immunoassays have been authorized for use under EUA and/or the CE mark, presenting varying overall clinical performance data generated by the manufacturer or by independent investigators. To compare the real-world clinical performance of commercially available rapid chromatographic immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of published data.

MethodsWe searched the MEDLINE(R), Embase, BIOSIS and Derwent Drug File (ProQuest)for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR assays. Only studies on lateral flow assays not needing a separate reader for retrieving the result were included, if data were available on viral load, patients symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used. For better data comparability, recalculation of the studies single performance data confidence intervals using the exact Clopper-Pearson method was applied.

ResultsWe could include 19 studies (ten peer-reviewed) presenting detailed clinical performance data on 11,209 samples with 2449 RT-PCR-positives out of study prevalence rates between 1.9-100 % and between 50- 100% symptomatic samples. Four studies directly compared two to three different RATs and 15 studies compared one RAT to RT-PCR. Overall specificity ranged, with one test outlier, between 92.4% (87.4- 95.9) and 100% (99.7-100), and overall clinical sensitivity varied between 28.9% (16.4-44.3) and 98.3% (91.1-99.7), depending on assay, population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold [&le;]25) showed a considerable heterogeneity among the assays ranging from 66.7% to 100%.

ConclusionOnly two RATs offered sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data supporting use for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic or high-viral-load patient populations. Reliable positive predictive values require testing of symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals only in case of a high pre-test probability. If RATs are used for screening of asymptomatic cases in low-prevalence scenarios, a lower positive predictive value of the result has to be considered.",Johannes Hayer; Dusanka Kasapic; Claudia Silke Zemmrich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248614,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248614,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
289,Predicting the Evolution of COVID-19 Mortality Risk: a Recurrent Neural Network Approach,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe propagation of COVID-19 in Spain prompted the declaration of the state of alarm on March 14, 2020. On 2 December 2020, the infection had been confirmed in 1,665,775 patients and caused 45,784 deaths. This unprecedented health crisis challenged the ingenuity of all professionals involved. Decision support systems in clinical care and health services management were identified as crucial in the fight against the pandemic.

MethodsThis study applies Deep Learning techniques for mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients. Two datasets with clinical information (medication, laboratory tests, vital signs etc.) of 2,307 and 3,870 COVID-19 infected patients admitted to two Spanish hospital chains were used. Firstly, we built a sequence of temporal events gathering all the clinical information for each patient. Next, we used the temporal sequences to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with an attention mechanism exploring interpretability. We conducted extensive experiments and trained the RNNs in different settings, performing hyperparameter search and cross-validation. We ensembled resulting RNNs to reduce variability and enhance sensitivity.

ResultsWe assessed the performance of our models using both global metrics, by averaging the performance across all the days in the sequences. We also measured day-by-day metrics starting from the day of hospital admission and the outcome day and evaluated the daily predictions. Regarding sensitivity, when compared to more traditional models, our best two RNN ensemble models outper-form a Support Vector Classifier in 6 and 16 percentage points, and Random Forest in 23 and 18 points. For the day-by-day predictions from the outcome date, the models also achieved better results than baselines showing systems ability towards early predictions.

ConclusionsWe have shown the feasibility of our approach to predict the clinical outcome (i.e. discharged alive or death) of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The result is a time series model that can support decision-making in healthcare systems and aims at interpretability. Despite the low-resource scenario, the results achieved are promising and suggests that more data will further increase the performance of the model.",Marta Villegas; Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre; Asier Gutiérrez-Fandiño; Jordi Armengol-Estapé; Casimiro Pio Carrino; David Pérez Fernández; Felipe Soares; Pablo Serrano; Miguel Pedrera; Noelia García; Alfonso Valencia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20244061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20244061,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
290,Hospitalization for self-harm during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France: a nationwide study,"IntroductionLittle is known to date about the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on self-harm incidence.

MethodsThe number of hospitalizations for self-harm in France (mainland and overseas) from January to August 2020 (which includes the first confinement from March 17th to May 11th) was compared to the same period in 2019-2017. Hospital data with the ICD-10 codes X60-84 were extracted from the national administrative database (PMSI).

ResultsThere were 53,583 hospitalizations for self-harm in France between January and August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 8.5% decrease. This decrease started the first week of the confinement and the number of hospitalizations remained at lower levels relative to 2019 until the end of August. The decrease was more marked in women (-9.8%) than men (-6.4%). However, an increase in hospitalizations was observed in individuals aged 75 and older (+5.3 to +11.6%). Moreover, the number of self-harm by firearm (+20.3%), jumping from height (+10.5%), and drowning (+4.7%) increased between 2019 and 2020, as well as the number of hospitalizations in intensive care (+3.5%) and deaths at discharge from hospital (+8.0%). No correlation was found between the evolution in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm and the number of severe cases of Covid-19 (hospitalization and mortality rates) across administrative departments.

DiscussionDuring the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France - including the first confinement -, a general decrease in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm was observed. However, an increase was found among elderly, a population at higher Covid 19-related mortality risk, and in the number of more severe suicidal acts. These results, therefore, shed light on a complex relationship between the pandemic and self-harm occurrence. This situation may change with time, which requires active suicide prevention strategies.",Fabrice Jollant; Adrien Roussot; Emmanuelle Corruble; Jean-Christophe CHAUVET-GELINIER; Bruno Falissard; Yann Mikaeloff; Catherine Quantin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248480,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248480,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
291,Coronavirus GenBrowser for monitoring adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 has widely spread across the world, and much research is being conducted on the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. To help control the infection, we developed the Coronavirus GenBrowser (CGB) to monitor the pandemic. CGB allows visualization and analysis of the latest viral genomic data. Distributed genome alignments and an evolutionary tree built on the existing subtree are implemented for easy and frequent updates. The tree-based data are compressed at a ratio of 2,760:1, enabling fast access and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CGB can effectively detect adaptive evolution of specific alleles, such as D614G of the spike protein, in their early stage of spreading. By lineage tracing, the most recent common ancestor, dated in early March 2020, of nine strains collected from six different regions in three continents was found to cause the outbreak in Xinfadi, Beijing, China in June 2020. CGB also revealed that the first COVID-19 outbreak in Washington State was caused by multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2. To encourage data sharing, CGB credits the person who first discovers any SARS-CoV-2 variant. As CGB is developed with eight different languages, it allows the general public in many regions of the world to easily access pre-analyzed results of more than 132,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. CGB is an efficient platform to monitor adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Dalang Yu; Xiao Yang; Bixia Tang; Yi-Hsuan Pan; Jianing Yang; Junwei Zhu; Guangya Duan; Zi-Qian Hao; Hailong Mu; Long Dai; Wangjie Hu; - Language translation team; Xiao Su; Guo-Qing Zhang; Wenming Zhao; Haipeng Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248612,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248612,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
292,Identifying communities at risk for COVID-19-related burden across 500 U.S. Cities and within New York City,"BackgroundWhile it is well-known that older individuals with certain comorbidities are at highest risk for complications related to COVID-19 including hospitalization and death, we lack tools to identify communities at highest risk with fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Information collected at a county level obscures local risk and complex interactions between clinical comorbidities, the built environment, population factors, and other social determinants of health.

MethodsWe develop a robust COVID-19 Community Risk Score (C-19 Risk Score) that summarizes the complex disease co-occurrences for individual census tracts with unsupervised learning, selected on their basis for association with risk for COVID complications, such as death. We mapped the C-19 Risk Score onto neighborhoods in New York City and associated the score with C-19 related death. We further predict the C-19 Risk Score using satellite imagery data to map the built environment in C-19 Risk.

ResultsThe C-19 Risk Score describes 85% of variation in co-occurrence of 15 diseases that are risk factors for COVID complications among 26K census tract neighborhoods (median population size of tracts: 4,091). The C-19 Risk Score is associated with a 40% greater risk for COVID-19 related death across NYC (April and September 2020) for a 1SD change in the score (Risk Ratio for 1SD change in C19 Risk Score: 1.4, p < .001). Satellite imagery coupled with social determinants of health explain nearly 90% of the variance in the C-19 Risk Score in the United States in held-out census tracts (R2 of 0.87).

293,"Risk factors for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A cross-sectional study in 116,678 people.","BackgroundThe risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well characterised in Western populations. We sought to identify potential risk factors for transmission and actionable information to prevent for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsIndividuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 at four major laboratories were invited. In addition, participants were sampled by convenience after a media campaign. Self-reported test results were compared with laboratory results, demographic data and behavioural facts were collected using a digital platform. In a cross-sectional design positive cases were compared with negative and untested control groups.

FindingsApproximately 14 days after a countrywide lockdown in Norway, 116,678 participants were included. Median age was 46 years, 44% had children in preschool or in school; 18% were practicing health professionals. International flights, contact with infected, and gatherings of more than 50 people, were associated with high risk. Health professionals who used public transport were at higher risk of testing positive than those who did not. Having undergone light infections, the last six months was strongly associated with lower odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Contact with children, use of hand sanitiser and use of protective gloves in private were also associated with lower odds ratio of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.

InterpretationFurther research is needed to explore if being a parent or looking after children is associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the next phases of the pandemic. Immunological research should be done to determine the effects of prior trivial infections on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirm that large gatherings during the pandemic should be avoided and those who are infected, or under suspicion thereof, posed very high risks to others this population.",Eyrun F Kjetland; Karl Trygve Kalleberg; Camilla Lund Soraas; Bato Hammarstrom; Tor Age Myklebust; Synne Jenum; Eyvind Axelsen; Andreas Lind; Roar Bevre-Jensen; Silje Bakken Jorgensen; Frank Olav Pettersen; Lene B Solberg; Cathrine Lund Hadley; Mette Stausland Istre; Knut Liestol; John Arne Dahl; Giske Ursin; Arne Soraas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248514,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248514,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
294,"Reducing contacts to stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the second pandemic wave in Brussels, Belgium","BackgroundReducing contacts is a cornerstone of containing SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the effect of physical distancing measures and of school reopening on contacts and consequently on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brussels, a hotspot during the second European wave.

MethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 case reports and contact tracing data during August-November 2020, we estimated changes in the age-specific number of reported contacts. We associated these trends with changes in the instantaneous reproduction number Rt and in age-specific transmission-events during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region. Furthermore, we analysed trends in age-specific case numbers, pre- and post-school opening.

FindingsWhen schools reopened and physical distancing measures relaxed, the weekly mean number of reported contacts surged from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) to 3.04 (95%CI 2.93-3.15), increasing across all ages. The fraction of cases aged 10-19 years started increasing before school reopening, with no further increase following school reopening (risk ratio 1.23, 95%CI 0.79-1.94). During the subsequent month, 8.9% (67/755) of infections identified were from teenagers to other ages, while 17.0% (131/755) from other ages to teenagers. Rt peaked mid-September at 1.48 (95%CI 1.35-1.63). Reintroduction of physical distancing measures reduced reported contacts to 1.85 (95%CI 1.78-1.91), resulting in Rt dropping below 1 within 3 weeks.

InterpretationThe second pandemic wave in Brussels was the result of increased contacts across all ages following school reopening. Stringent physical distancing measures, including closure of bars and limiting close contacts while schools remain open, reduced social mixing, in turn controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

295,Adenovirus and RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines: perceptions and acceptance among healthcare workers,"ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy, and acceptance rate of various COVID-19 vaccine types among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience.

DesignNational cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire.

SettingOnline, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs.

ParticipantsA total of 2,007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 75.3% completed the survey and were included in the analysis.

InterventionData were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during November 1-15, 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD7) scale.

ResultsAmong the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccines efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%), and the vaccines manufacturing country (28.6%).

ConclusionsAwareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination.

296,Toward a COVID-19 testing policy: where and how to test when the purpose is to isolate silent spreaders,"BackgroundTo stop pandemics, such as COVID-19, infected individuals should be detected, treated if needed, and -to prevent contacts with susceptible individuals-isolated. Because most infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when testing misses such cases, epidemics may growth exponentially, inducing a high number of deaths. In contrast, a relatively low number of COVID-19 related deaths may occur when both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are tested.

MethodsTo evaluate these hypotheses, a method composed of three elements was evaluated, which included: (i) county- and country-level geo-referenced data, (ii) cost-benefit related considerations, and (iii) temporal data on mortality or test positivity (TP). TP is the percentage of infections found among tested individuals. Temporal TP data were compared to the tests/case ratio (T/C ratio) as well as the number of tests performed/million inhabitants (tests/mi) and COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi).

FindingsTwo temporal TP profiles were distinguished, which, early, displayed low ([~] 1 %) and/or decreasing TP percentages or the opposite pattern, respectively. Countries that exhibited >10 TP % expressed at least ten times more COVID-19 related deaths/mi than low TP countries. An intermediate pattern was identified when the T/C ratio was explored. Geo-referenced, TP-based analysis discovered municipalities where selective testing would be more cost-effective than alternatives.

InterpretationsWhen TP is low and/or the T/C ratio is high, testing detects asymptomatic cases and the number of COVID-19 related deaths/mi is low. Geo-referenced TP data can support cost-effective, site-specific policies. TP promotes the prompt cessation of epidemics and fosters science-based testing policies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo map this field, bibliographic searches were conducted in the Web of Science, which included the following results: (i) COVID-19 (95,133 hits), (ii) SARS COV-2 (33,680 hits), (iii) testing policy and COVID-19 (939 hits), (iv) testing policy and SARS COV-2 (340 hits), (v) testing policy and COVID-19 and asymptomatic (80 hits), (vi) testing policy and SARS COV-2 and asymptomatic (54 hits); (vii) test positivity and COVID-19 and validation (7 hits), and (viii) test positivity and SARS CoV-2 and validation (5 hits). Therefore, before this study, testing policy in relation to asymptomatic cases as well as test positivity represented a very low proportion (between [~]1 thousandth to [~] 1 ten thousandth) of all publications. While many articles distinguished between diagnostic and screening tests, no paper was found in which testing policy is mentioned as part of a process ultimately designed to isolate all infected individuals. The few articles that mentioned test positivity only investigated symptomatic cases. These quanti/qualitative assessments led the authors to infer that neither testing policy nor test positivity had been adequately validated and/or investigated.

Added value of this studyWe provide the first validation of test positivity as an estimate of disease prevalence under rapidly changing conditions: in pandemics, disease prevalence may vary markedly within short periods of time. We also address a double limitation of control campaigns against COVID-19, namely: it is unknown who and where to test. Asymptomatic cases are not likely to seek medical assistance: while they feel well, they silently spread this pandemic. Because they represent approximately half of all infected individuals, they are a large, moving, and invisible target. Where to find them is also unknown because (i) randomized testing is likely to fail and (ii) testing is very limited. Usually, the locations where infected people reside are not randomly distributed but geographically clustered, and, up to now less than four persons per thousand inhabitants are tested on a given day. However, by combining geo-referenced test positivity data with cost-benefit considerations, we generate approaches not only likely to induce high benefits without increasing costs but also free of assumptions: we measure bio-geography as it is.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe fact that asymptomatic cases were not tested in many countries may explain the exponential growth and much higher number of deaths observed in those countries. Ineffective testing (and, therefore, ineffective isolation) can also result from the absence of geo-referenced data analysis. Because the geographical location where people reside, work, study, or shop is not a random event, the analysis of small greographical areas is essential. Only when actual geographical relationships are observed, optimal (cost-benefit oriented) testing policies can be devised.",Ariel L Rivas; Almira L Hoogesteijn; James Hittner; Marc HV van Regenmortel; Prakasha Kempaiah; Paris Vogazianos; Athos Antoniades; Jose PL Febles; Folorunso Oludayo Fasina,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20223651,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20223651,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
297,Analysis of genome characteristics and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 strains in North-East of Romania during the first COVID-19 outbreak,"Romania officially declared its first SARS-CoV-2 case on February 26, 2020. The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation.

298,COVID-19 deaths detected in a systematic post-mortem surveillance study in Africa,"ObjectivesLimited SARS CoV 2 testing in many African countries has constrained availability of data on the impact of COVID-19 (CV19). To address this gap, we conducted a systematic post-mortem surveillance study to directly measure the fatal impact of CV19 in an urban African population.

DesignWe enrolled deceased individuals at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Morgue in Lusaka, Zambia. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs for testing via reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) against the SARS-2 Coronavirus. We stratified deaths by CV19 status, by location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors.

SettingUTH is Zambias largest tertiary care referral hospital and its morgue registers [~]80% of Lusakas deaths.

ParticipantsParticipants of all ages were enrolled if within 48 hours of death and if the next of kin or representative provided written informed consent.

ResultsWe enrolled 372 participants between June and September 2020, and had PCR results for 364 (99.5%). CV19 was detected in 70/364 (19.2%). The median age for CV19+ deaths was 48 years (IQR 36-72 years) and 70% were male. Most CV19+ deaths (51/70, 72.8%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for CV19 antemortem. Among the 19/70 facility deaths, six were tested antemortem. Among the 52/70 CV19 deaths with symptoms data, 44/52 had typical symptoms of CV19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested antemortem. We identified CV19 among seven children; only one had been tested antemortem. The proportion of CV19+ deaths increased with age, but 75.7% of CV19+ deaths were aged <60 years. The five most common co-morbidities among CV19+ deaths were: tuberculosis (31.4%); hypertension (27.1%); HIV/AIDS (22.9%); alcohol use (17.1%); and diabetes (12.9%).

ConclusionsContrary to expectations, CV19+ deaths were common in Lusaka. The majority occurred in the community where testing capacity is lacking. Yet few who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of CV19. Therefore, CV19 cases were under reported because testing was rarely done, not because CV19 was rare.

299,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Latvia under low incidence in Spring 2020,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a new infectious disease with severe disease course and high mortality in some groups. Blood tests on admission to the hospital can be useful for stratification of patients and timely correction. Our study investigated the clinical features of COVID-19 patients in Latvia and differences in blood tests in groups with different disease severity.

MethodsThe retrospective study included 100 patients hospitalized in Riga East Clinical University Hospital in Spring 2020. The severity of the disease course was classified by the presence of pneumonia and its combination with respiratory failure. We have assessed blood cells count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin T, electrolytes, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), D-dimer, prothrombin time, prothrombin index, oxygen saturation, and temperature on admission to the hospital.

ResultsPatients were from 18 to 99 (57{+/-}18 years, 57% males). Comorbidities were found in 74% of patients. The mild, moderate, and severe groups included 35, 44, and 16 patients, respectively. In the severe group, the mortality rate was 50%. The progression to severe COVID-19 was associated positively with temperature, ESR, CRP, creatinine, LDH, and troponin T and negatively associated with oxygen saturation, eosinophils, and GFR on admission to the hospital.

300,Effective design of barrier enclosure to contain aerosol emissions from COVID-19 patients,"Facing shortages of personal protective equipment, some clinicians have advocated the use of barrier enclosures (typically mounted over the head, with and without suction) to contain aerosol emissions from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. There is however little evidence for its usefulness. To test the effectiveness of such a device, we built a manikin that can expire micron-sized aerosols at flow rates close to physiological conditions. We then placed the manikin inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with sufficient suction, it is possible to effectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow rates (up to 60 L min-1) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%. In contrast, a passive barrier without suction only reduces aerosol exposure by 60%.",Dan Daniel; Marcus Lin; Irvan Luhung; Tony Lui; Anton Sadovoy; Xueqi Koh; Anqi Sng; Tuan Tran; Stephan Schuster; Xian Jun Loh; Oo Schwe Tet; Chee Keat Tan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20246868,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20246868,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
301,Emotional Adaptation During A Crisis: Decline in Anxiety and Depression After the Initial Weeks of COVID-19 in the United States,"ObjectiveCrises such as the COVID-19 pandemic are known to exacerbate depression and anxiety, though their temporal trajectories remain unclear. The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using COVID-19 as a model crisis.

Methods1,512 adults living in the U.S. enrolled in this online study on April 2nd, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4th, 2020; final n=537). Depression and anxiety were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related questions. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety.

ResultsDepression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time (F(9,4824)=17.53, p<.001 and F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, respectively). In addition to demographic factors such as sex, age, income, and psychiatric diagnoses, we identified some overlapping and some distinct dynamic factors contributing to changes in depression and anxiety: worsening of weekly individual economic impact of COVID-19 increased both depression and anxiety, while increased seven-day change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected pandemic duration were positively associated with anxiety, but not depression.

ConclusionsAlongside evidence for overall emotional adaptation, these findings highlight overlapping (economic), yet distinct (change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected COVID-19 duration) factors contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of COVID-19.

The aim was to compare anxiety, depression and coping styles between patients infected with COVID-19 disease with and without CMI during the peak of COVID-19 disease in Egypt. This is a cross sectional study, that included an online survey consisting of Arabic versions of General Health Questionnaire-12, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Brief-COPE scale. Questionnaires were distributed to adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during their quarantine in Egypt. One hundred ninety-nine patients responded to the survey, where 46.73% of them had CMI. Religion, emotional support, use of informational support and acceptance were the most used coping strategies by participants. Avoidant coping strategies were frequently used by divorced patients, home quarantined individuals, patients who developed COVID-19 related anxiety/depression and patients who didnt receive hydroxyl-chloroquine. Approach strategies were frequently used by patients with mild COVID-19.

303,"How the COVID-19 pandemic affects transgender health care in upper-middle income and high income countries - A worldwide, cross-sectional survey","BackgroundSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to medical care was restricted for nearly all non-acute medical conditions. Due to their status as a vulnerable social group and the inherent need for transition-related treatments (e.g., hormone treatment), transgender people are assumed to be affected particularly severely by the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and health care of transgender people.

Methods and findingsAs an ad hoc collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and 23 community organizations, we developed a web-based survey. The survey was translated into 26 languages, and participants were recruited via various social media and LGBTIQ-community sources. Recruitment started in May 2020. We assessed demographical data, physical and mental health problems (e.g., chronic physical conditions), risk factors (e.g., smoking), COVID-19 data (symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19), and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to transgender health care and health-related supplies. To identify factors associated with the experience of restrictions to transgender health care, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis.

5267 transgender people from 63 higher-middle income and high-income countries participated in the study. Over 50% of the participants had risk factors for a severe course of a COVID-19 infection and were at a high risk of avoiding testing or treatment of a COVID-19 infection due to the fear of mistreatment or discrimination. Access to transgender health care services was restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic for 50% of the participants. Male sex assigned at birth and a lower monthly income were significant predictors for the experience of restrictions to health care. 35.0% of the participants reported at least one mental health conditions. Every third participant had suicidal thoughts, and 3.2% have attempted suicide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A limitation of the study is that we did not analyze data from low-income countries and access to the internet was necessary to participate.

ConclusionsTransgender people are assumed to suffer under the severity of the pandemic even more than the general population due to the intersections between their status as a vulnerable social group, their high amount of medical risk factors, and their need for ongoing medical treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic can potentiate these vulnerabilities, add new challenges for transgender individuals, and, therefore, can lead to devastating consequences, like severe physical or mental health issues, self-harming behaviour, and suicidality.",Andreas Koehler; Joz Motmans; Leo Mulio Alvarez; David Azul; Karen Badalyan; Koray Basar; Cecilia Dhejne; Dragana Duisin; Bartosz Grabski; Aurore Dufrasne; Natasa Jokic-Begic; Antonio Prunas; Christina Richards; Kirill Sabir; Jaimie Vaele; Timo Ole Nieder,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248794,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248794,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
304,Environmental scan of provincial and territorial planning for COVID-19 vaccination programs,"BackgroundPublic health departments in Canada are currently facing the challenging task of planning and implementing COVID-19 vaccination programs.

ObjectiveTo collect and synthesize information regarding COVID-19 vaccination programs in each of the provinces and territories (P/Ts).

MethodsProvincial/territorial public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics, drawn from scientific literature and media: unique factors for COVID-19 vaccination, adoption of National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommendations, priority groups for early vaccination, and vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring. Data were grouped according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed.

ResultsEighteen interviews occurred with 25 participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. Factors unique to COVID-19 vaccination included prioritizing groups for early vaccination (n=7), public perception of vaccines (n=6), and differing eligibility criteria (n=5). Almost all P/Ts (n=10) reported reliance on NACI recommendations. Long-term care residents (n=10) and health care workers (n=10) were most frequently prioritized for early vaccination, followed by people with chronic medical conditions (n=9) and seniors (n=8). Most P/Ts (n=9) are planning routine adverse event monitoring to assess vaccine safety. Evaluation of effectiveness was anticipated to occur within public health departments (n=3), by researchers (n=3), or based on national guidance (n=4).

ConclusionPlans for COVID-19 vaccination programs in the P/Ts exhibit some similarities and are largely consistent with NACI guidelines, with some discrepancies.

305,Acceptance and Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccines: A Cross-Sectional Study from Jordan,"BackgroundVaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in Jordan.

MethodsAn online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines acceptability.

ResultsA total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR=2.488, 95CI%=1.834-3.375, p<.001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR=2.036, 95CI%=1.306-3.174, p=.002) were more likely to accept Covid-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed that vaccines are generally safe (OR=9.258, 95CI%=6.020-14.237, p<.001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR=19.223, 95CI%=13.665-27.042, p<.001), once available, were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR=0.376, 95CI%=0.233-0.607, p<.001) and employed participants (OR=0.542, 95CI%=0.405-0.725, p<.001) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR=0.502, 95CI%=0.356- 0.709, p<.001) and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19 vaccines (OR=0.271, 95CI%=0.183 - 0.400, p<.001), were less likely to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers.

ConclusionSystematic interventions are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of vaccines hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was utilized in their production.",Tamam El-Elimat; Mahmoud M.

306,Introduction into the Marseille geographical area of a mild SARS-CoV-2 variant originating from sub-Saharan Africa,"BACKGROUNDIn Marseille, France, the COVID-19 incidence evolved unusually with several successive epidemic episodes. The second outbreak started in July, was associated with North Africa, and involved travelers and an outbreak on passenger ships. This suggested the involvement of a new viral variant.

METHODSWe sequenced the genomes from 916 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in our institute. The patients demographic and clinical features were compared according to the infecting viral variant.

RESULTSFrom June 26th to August 14th, we identified a new viral variant (Marseille-1). Based on genome sequences (n=89) or specific qPCR (n=53), 142 patients infected with this variant were detected. It is characterized by a combination of 10 mutations located in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp12, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N/ORF14 genes. We identified Senegal and Gambia, where the virus had been transferred from China and Europe in February-April as the sources of the Marseille-1 variant, which then most likely reached Marseille through Maghreb when French borders reopened. In France, this variant apparently remained almost limited to Marseille. In addition, it was significantly associated with a milder disease compared to clade 20A ancestor strains.

There are three phases of COVID-19: early infection stage, pulmonary stage and hyper-inflammation stage respectively. It is important to prevent lung or other organs injuries by preventing phase-II and phase-III via pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments. This was a case series study done on twenty-two patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients in this study have been used quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as supplements for 3 to 5 days during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid combination supplements on patients with COVID-19. The mean levels of WBC, ANC, ALC, AMC and AST were normal among all included patients before and after taking quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid supplements (P-value > 0.05). Quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily supplements were safe for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may prevent poor prognosis.

308,Hydrating the Respiratory Tract: An Alternative Explanation Why Masks Lower Severity of COVID-19 Disease,"Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFacemasks are the most widely used tool for mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased disease severity by the wearer has also been linked to the use of cloth facemasks. This well-documented finding is surprising considering that such masks are poor at filtering the smallest aerosol particles, which can reach the lower respiratory tract and have been associated with severe disease. We show that facemasks strongly increase the effective humidity of inhaled air, thereby promoting hydration of the respiratory epithelium which is known to be beneficial to the immune system. Increased humidity of inspired air could be an alternate explanation for the now well-established link between mask wearing and lower disease severity.",Adriaan Bax; Joseph M Courtney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248671,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248671,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
309,The experience of European hospital-based healthcare workers on following infection prevention and control procedures for COVID-19,"BackgroundWorking under pandemic conditions exposes health care workers (HCWs) to infection risk and psychological strain. Protecting the physical and psychological health of HCWs is a key priority. This study assessed the perceptions of European hospital HCWs of local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on their emotional wellbeing.

MethodsWe performed two rounds of an international cross-sectional survey, between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks (round 1), and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling (round 2). Main outcome measures were (1) behavioural determinants of HCW adherence with IPC procedures, (2) WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0-100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression.

Results2,289 HCWs (round 1: n=190, round 2: n=2,099) from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age of respondents was 42 ({+/-}11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n=1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n=527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value <.01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.8).

ConclusionsIn Europe, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on those providing direct COVID-19 patient care, junior staff and women.

310,Engineered CRISPR/Cas12a Enables Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP pre-amplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12aD156R, engineered chimeric DNA-extended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 L of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute pre-amplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.",Long T.

311,Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences in a national cohort in the United States,"In order to understand preferences about SARS-CoV-2 testing, we conducted a discrete choice experiment among 4793 participants in the Communities, Households, and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING COVID) Cohort Study from July 30-September 8, 2020. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of preferences related to testing and conducted a simulation to predict testing uptake if additional testing scenarios were offered. Five distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing emerged. ""Comprehensive testers"" (18.9%) ranked specimen type as most important and favored less invasive specimen types, with saliva most preferred, and also ranked venue and result turnaround time as highly important, with preferences for home testing and fast result turnaround time. ""Fast track testers"" (26.0%) ranked result turnaround time as most important and favored immediate and same day turnaround time. ""Dual testers"" (18.5%) ranked test type as most important and preferred both antibody and viral tests. ""Non-invasive dual testers"" (33.0%) ranked specimen type and test type as similarly most important, preferring cheek swab specimen type and both antibody and viral tests. ""Home testers"" (3.6%) ranked venue as most important and favored home-based testing. By offering less invasive (saliva specimen type), dual testing (both viral and antibody tests), and at home testing scenarios in addition to standard testing scenarios, simulation models predicted that testing uptake would increase from 81.7% to 98.1%. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing and found that offering additional testing options, which consider this heterogeneity, would likely increase testing uptake.

SIGNIFICANCEDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic testing has allowed for early detection of cases and implementation of measures to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding individuals preferences about testing and the service models that deliver tests are relevant in efforts to increase and sustain uptake of SARS-CoV-2 testing, which, despite vaccine availability, will be required for the foreseeable future. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a discrete choice experiment among a large national cohort of adults in the US. Offering additional testing options that account for or anticipate this heterogeneity in preferences (e.g., both viral and antibody tests, at home testing), would likely increase testing uptake.

312,Spotlight on the dark figure: Exhibiting dynamics in the case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections in Germany,"The case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections varies over time due to changing testing capacities, modified testing strategies and also, apparently, due to the dynamics in the number of infected itself. In this paper we investigate these dynamics by jointly looking at the reported number of detected COVID-19 infections with non-fatal and fatal outcomes in different age groups in Germany. We propose a statistical approach that allows us to spotlight the case detection ratio and quantify its changes over time. With this we can adjust the case counts reported at different time points so that they become comparable. Moreover we can explore the temporal development of the real number of infections, shedding light on the dark number. The results show that the case detection ratio has increased and, depending on the age group, is four to six times higher at the beginning of the second wave compared to what it was at the peak of the first wave. The true number of infection in Germany in October was considerably lower as during the peak of the first wave, where only a small fraction of COVID-19 infections were detected. Our modelling approach also allows quantifying the effects of different testing strategies on the case detection ratio.

We investigated the incubation period of COVID-19 with regard to age, biological sex, location, and severity of the disease. Based on the data extracted, we report an overall mean and median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.894 days and 5.598 days, respectively. The incubation period did not statistically vary for biological sex or age, but some studies suggest a longer incubation period in the young and elderly. Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei Province of China may have a shorter incubation period for COVID-19 but the shorter incubation period may be due to an increase in viral load. In studying coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS, researchers have discovered an inverse relationship between incubation period length and virus severity.

However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR model. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model and show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top 2 models out of 10 submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.",Graham C Gibson; Nicholas G Reich; Daniel Sheldon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248736,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248736,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
315,Unravelling the early warning capability of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19: A temporal study on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and need for the escalation,"Wastewater-based Epidemiological (WBE) surveillance offers a promising approach to assess the pandemic situation covering pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in highly populated area under limited clinical tests. In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N ([~]120%) and ORF 1ab ([~]38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September ([~]924.5 copies/ L) than August ([~]897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a [~] 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.

HIGHLIGHTS{square} Study unravels the early warning potential of wastewater based surveillance of COVID-19.

316,"SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Florida, Illinois, and Maryland: Access and Barriers","ObjectiveTo characterize the SARS-CoV-2 testing cascade and associated barriers in three US states.

MethodsWe recruited participants from Florida, Illinois, and Maryland ([~]1000/state) for an online survey September 16 - October 15, 2020. The survey covered demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and experiences around SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in the prior 2 weeks. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations with outcomes of interest.

ResultsOverall, 316 (10%) of 3,058 respondents wanted/needed a test in the two weeks prior to the survey. Of these, 166 (53%) were able to get tested and 156 (94%) received results; 53% waited [&ge;] 8 days to get results from when they wanted/needed a test. There were no significant differences by state. Among those wanting/needing a test, getting tested was significantly less common among men (aOR: 0.46) and those reporting black race (aOR: 0.53) and more common in those reporting recent travel (aOR: 3.35).

317,Forecasting intensive care unit demand during the COVID-19 pandemic: A spatial age-structured microsimulation model,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk of overburdening health care systems, and in particular intensive care units (ICUs). Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), ranging from wearing masks to (partial) lockdowns have been implemented as mitigation measures around the globe. However, especially severe NPIs are used with great caution due to their negative effects on the economy, social life and mental well-being. Thus, understanding the impact of the pandemic on ICU demand under alternative scenarios reflecting different levels of NPIs is vital for political decision-making on NPIs.

ObjectiveThe aim is to support political decision-making by forecasting COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID-19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. Substantial sub-national variation in COVID-19-related ICU demand requires a spatially disaggregated approach. This should not only take sub-national variation in ICU-relevant disease dynamics into account, but also variation in the population at risk including COVID-19-relevant risk characteristics (e.g. age), and factors mitigating the pandemic. The forecast provides indications for policy makers and health care stakeholders as to whether mitigation measures have to be maintained or even strengthened to prevent ICU demand from exceeding supply, or whether there is leeway to relax them.

MethodsWe implement a spatial age-structured microsimulation model of the COVID-19 pandemic by extending the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework. The model accounts for regional variation in population age structure and in spatial diffusion pathways. In a first step, we calibrate the model by applying a genetic optimization algorithm against hospital data on ICU patients with COVID-19. In a second step, we forecast COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID 19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. We apply the model to Germany and provide state-level forecasts over a 2-month period, which can be updated daily based on latest data on the progression of the pandemic.

ResultsTo illustrate the merits of our model, we present here ""forecasts"" of ICU demand for different stages of the pandemic during 2020. Our forecasts for a quiet summer phase with low infection rates identified quite some variation in potential for relaxing NPIs across the federal states. By contrast, our forecasts during a phase of quickly rising infection numbers in autumn (second wave) suggested that all federal states should implement additional NPIs. However, the identified needs for additional NPIs varied again across federal states. In addition, our model suggests that during large infection waves ICU demand would quickly exceed supply, if there were no NPIs in place to contain the virus.

ConclusionOur results provide evidence for substantial spatial variation in (1) the effect of the pandemic on ICU demand, and (2) the potential and need for NPI adjustments at different stages of the pandemic. Forecasts with our spatial age-structured microsimulation model allow to take this spatial variation into account. The model is programmed in R and can be applied to other countries, provided that reliable data on the number of ICU patients infected with COVID-19 are available at sub-national level.",Sebastian Kluesener; Ralf Schneider; Matthias Rosenbaum-Feldbruegge; Christian Dudel; Elke Loichinger; Nikola Sander; Andreas Backhaus; Emanuele Del Fava; Janina Esins; Martina Fischer; Linus Grabenhenrich; Pavel Grigoriev; Andre Grow; Jason Hilton; Bastian Koller; Mikko Myrskyla; Francesco Scalone; Martin Wolkewitz; Emilio Zagheni; Michael M.

It focuses on the spread dynamics between Phase I (from March 23th to May 31st, 2020) and II (from June 1st to August 22th, 2020) of the social distancing measures. It also examines municipal-level factors associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic. The analysis of the geographic pattern of the pandemic via Space-Time Scan Statistics (SaTScan) revealed fast spread among municipalities. During Phase I, clusters of infections and deaths were mainly located at the center of the country, while in Phase II, these clusters dispersed to the rest of the country.

319,On an optimal testing strategy for workplace settings operating during the COVID-19 pandemic,"High quality daily testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in workplace settings has become part of the standard and mandatory protection measures implemented widely in response to the current pandemic. Such tests are often limited to a small fraction of the attending personnel due to cost considerations, limited availability and processing capabilities and the often cumbersome requirements of the test itself. A maximally efficient use of such an important and frequently scarce resource is clearly required. We here present an optimal testing strategy which minimises the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic members of the population, derived under a series of simplifying assumptions, which however retain many of the generalities of the problem and yield robust results, as verified through a number of numerical simulations. We show that reduction in overall infected-person-days, IPD, by significant percentages can be achieved, for fixed numbers of tests per day of 5% and 10% of the population, of 30% and 50% in the IPD numbers, respectively.",Xavier Hernandez; Sergio Valentinotti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248752,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248752,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
320,"""There's No Place Like Home for The Holidays:"" Travel and SARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity Following Thanksgiving Weekend","In the US, public health officials discouraged travel and social gatherings for Thanksgiving. Data suggests that many individuals did travel over the holidays, albeit in smaller numbers than previous years. Using an online panel survey of individuals across ten US states, we found that many individuals reported spending Thanksgiving outside of their home (25.9%) or at home with at least one non-household member (27.3%). Among those who were tested, those who had Thanksgiving outside their home were significantly more likely to self-report a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior two weeks compared to those who had Thanksgiving at home with non-household members or with household members only (41.7% vs. 21.4% and 13.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Persons who had Thanksgiving outside their home and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 participated in a median 35 (IQR: 21 - 53). non-essential activities compared to those who had Thanksgiving at home and tested positive (median 3 activities, IQR 0-13). Notably, planned travel over the December holidays was most common among those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the prior 2 weeks (66.5%) compared with 25.4% of those who tested negative in the prior 2 weeks and 11.0% among those who were not tested. While public health authorities should continue promoting messages to dissuade travel and social gatherings over the holidays, as supported by these data, it is equally important to promote messaging on how to get together in a ""low-risk"" manner for those who travel and plan gatherings. In particular, it is critical that those who do travel or visit with others outside their household do so cautiously and avoid or significantly minimize all other activities where they may potentially acquire and transmit infection in the weeks prior to and after their visit.",Shruti H.

321,HLA-C* 04:01 is a Genetic Risk Allele for Severe Course of COVID-19,"BackgroundSince the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been increasing demand to identify predictors of severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study using HLA sequencing with subsequent independent validation.

MethodsWe analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19 were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts (n=240).

ResultsWe identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036). Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis.

ConclusionsHLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify high-risk patients and individualize management.",January Weiner III; Phillip Suwalski; Manuel Holtgrewe; Charlotte Thibeault; Melina Mueller; Dimitri Patriki; Claudia Quedenau; Ulrike Krueger; Elisa Theresa Helbig; Lena Lippert; Paula Stubbemann; Luis Miguel Real; Juan Macias Sanchez; Juan A.

322,Inferring Toll-Like Receptor induced epitope subunit vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2: A Reverse Vaccinology approach,"Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are a group of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) which bind to the exogenous pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like other PRRs; hence the main function is to sense the harmness and mediate the innate immune response to pathogens. TLRs play an important role in innate immune responses to infection. The host has evolved to use other TLR and PAMP agonists as agents to stimulate a protective inflammatory immune response against infection. Because only a small number of doses are given, TLR agonists appear to have greater potential and fewer safety concerns than other uses as vaccine adjuvants. In the present days, development of peptides targeting immune response can be approved for survival in biological monitoring systems before vaccine exposures. Peptide vaccines are easy to synthesize, more stable and relatively safe. In addition, production of peptides becomes simple, easily reproducible, fast and cost effective. Getting vaccinated against Covid-19, which has become a pandemic in the human population, is the most practical way to control the outbreak. The new coronavirus does not contain a drug or vaccine to prevent it from spreading to humans. To getting a proper vaccine candidate against the novel coronavirus, the present study used the reverse vaccinology approach by using a complete set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; such as: Spike, Envelope, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, NSPs, and ORFs to extract the antigenic elements that produce B-cell, T-cell and IFN positive epitopes. These epitopes with precise binding to the Toll-Like receptors (1-10) have developed epitope based vaccine candidates. We have prioritized a set of epitopes based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, sequence conservation and projected population coverage world-wide. The selected epitopes were employed for in-silico docking interactions with Toll-Like receptors and molecular dynamic simulation confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidates resulting epitope of spike proteins with both the TLR 7 and 8 shows the best binding affinity. We believe that this ideal epitope vaccine candidate could enhance the immune response of the host and reduce the reinfection risk.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424322,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.424322,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,False

Drug combination strategies of repurposed drugs offer a number of advantages to monotherapies including the potential to achieve greater efficacy, the potential to increase the therapeutic index of drugs and the potential to reduce the emergence of drug resistance. Combination of agents with antiviral mechanisms of action with immune-modulatory or anti-inflammatory drug is also worthy of investigation. Here, we report on the in vitro synergistic interaction between two FDA approved drugs, remdesivir (RDV) and ivermectin (IVM) resulting in enhanced antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19.

324,SARS-CoV-2 sensing by RIG-I and MDA5 links epithelial infection to macrophage inflammation,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes broad-spectrum immunopathological disease, exacerbated by inflammatory co-morbidities. A better understanding of mechanisms underpinning virus-associated inflammation is required to develop effective therapeutics. Here we discover that SARS-CoV-2 replicates rapidly in lung epithelial cells despite triggering a robust innate immune response through activation of cytoplasmic RNA-ensors RIG-I and MDA5. The inflammatory mediators produced during epithelial cell infection can stimulate primary human macrophages to enhance cytokine production and drive cellular activation. Critically, this can be limited by abrogating RNA sensing, or by inhibiting downstream signalling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 further exacerbates the local inflammatory environment when macrophages or epithelial cells are primed with exogenous inflammatory stimuli. We propose that RNA sensing of SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelium is a key driver of inflammation, the extent of which is influenced by the inflammatory state of the local environment, and that specific inhibition of innate immune pathways may beneficially mitigate inflammation-associated COVID-19.

325,SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification using droplet digital RT-PCR,"Quantitative viral load assays have transformed our understanding of - and ability to manage - viral diseases. They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), yield semi-quantitative results only. Reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), a technology that partitions each reaction into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets prior to amplification, offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. We evaluated eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for use in RT-ddPCR, and identified three (Charite-Berlin E-Sarbeco and Pasteur Institute IP2 and IP4) as the most efficient, precise and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. Analytical efficiency of the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set, for example, was ~83%, while assay precision, as measured by the coefficient of variation, was ~2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo. We further calibrated RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers against cycle threshold (Ct) values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform. The resulting log-linear relationship can be used to mathematically derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers from Ct values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology.",Natalie N.

326,Combined RT-qPCR and Pyrosequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Polybasic Cleavage Motif Uncovers Rare Pediatric COVID-19 Spectrum Diseases of Unusual Presentation,"BackgroundSurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is essential for the global containment measures with regard to the ongoing pandemic. Diagnostic gold standard is currently reverse transcription of the (+)RNA genome and subgenomic RNAs and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens, we propose the combination of the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This extension might add important value mainly in cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results.s

ResultsWe successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics or for epidemiologic studies. This allows a more reliable interpretation of conflicting RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR (CT values >30). After laboratory implementation and characterization of a best practice protocol we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 6 previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 associated diseases, partially exhibiting unusual and heterogeneous presentation. Moreover, it is notable that in the course of RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing method establishment we did not observe any case of false-positive diagnosis when confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were used from foregoing routine testing.

ConclusionsThe proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. Combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing does not negatively affect preceding RT-qPCR pipeline in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and can be optionally applied in routine to inspect conflicting RT-qPCR results.",Patrick Philipp Weil; Jacqueline Hentschel; Frank Schult; Anton Pembaur; Beniam Ghebremedhin; Olivier Mboma; Andreas Heusch; Anna-Christin Reuter; Daniel Mueller; Stefan Wirth; Malik Aydin; Andreas C.

327,Identification of COVID-19-relevant transcriptional regulatory networks and associated kinases as potential therapeutic targets,"Identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and signaling networks involved in the response of host to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is a powerful approach that provides a systems biology view of gene expression programs involved in COVID-19 and may enable identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease. In this study, we combined a series of recently developed computational tools to identify transcriptional regulatory networks involved in the response of epithelial cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and particularly regulatory mechanisms that are specific to this virus. In addition, using network-guided analyses, we identified signaling pathways that are associated with these networks and kinases that may regulate them. The results identified classical antiviral response pathways including Interferon response factors (IRFs), interferons (IFNs), and JAK-STAT signaling as key elements upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to mock-treated cells. In addition, comparing SARS-Cov-2 infection of airway epithelial cells to other respiratory viruses identified pathways associated with regulation of inflammation (MAPK14) and immunity (BTK, MBX) that may contribute to exacerbate organ damage linked with complications of COVID-19.

328,No evidence for human monocyte-derived macrophage infection and antibody-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Vaccines are essential to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to protect the vulnerable population. However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in human macrophages. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.",Obdulio Garcia-Nicolas; Ferdinand Zettl; Gert Zimmer; Volker Thiel; Artur Summerfield,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423940,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423940,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
329,Host Cell Proteases Drive Early or Late SARS-CoV-2 Penetration,"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) that spread through human populations worldwide in early 2020. CoVs rely on host cell proteases for activation and infection. The trypsin-like protease TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, cathepsin L in endolysosomes, and furin in the Golgi have all been implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic processing. Whether SARS-CoV-2 depends on endocytosis internalization and vacuolar acidification for infectious entry remains unclear. Here, we examined the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 activation during the cell entry process in tissue culture. Using four cell lines representative of lung, colon, and kidney epithelial tissues, we found that TMPRSS2 determines the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. In TMPRSS2-positive cells, infection was sensitive to aprotinin, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, but not to SB412515, a drug that impairs cathepsin L. Infectious penetration was marginally dependent on endosomal acidification, and the virus passed the protease-sensitive step within 10 min. In a marked contrast, in TMPRSS2-negative cells cathepsin L and low pH were required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The cathepsin L-activated penetration occurred within 40-60 min after internalization and required intact endolysosomal functions. Importantly, pre-activation of the virus allowed it to bypass the need for endosomal acidification for viral fusion and productive entry. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other CoVs a strategy of differential use of host cell proteases for activation and infectious penetration. This study also highlights the importance of TMPRSS2 in dictating the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2.

SignificancePreventing SARS-CoV-2 spread requires approaches affecting early virus-host cell interactions before the virus enters and infects target cells. Host cell proteases are critical for coronavirus activation and infectious entry. Here, we reconcile apparent contradictory observations from recent reports on endosomal acidification and the role of furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L in the productive entry and fusion process of SARS-CoV-2. Investigating authentic virus in various cell types, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 developed the ability to use different entry pathways, depending on the proteases expressed by the target cell. Our results have strong implications for future research on the apparent broad tropism of the virus in vivo. This study also provides a handle to develop novel antiviral strategies aiming to block virus entry, as illustrated with the several drugs that we identified to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, some with low IC50.",Jana Koch; Zina M Uckeley; Patricio Doldan; Megan L Stanifer; Steeve Boulant; Pierre-Yves Lozach,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423906,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423906,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
330,Elucidating the antiviral mechanism of different MARCH proteins,"The Membrane Associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins belong to a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, whose main function is to remove transmembrane proteins from the plasma membrane. Recent work has shown that the human MARCH1, 2 and 8 are antiretroviral factors that target the Human Immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins by reducing their incorporation in the budding virions. Nevertheless, the dearth of information regarding the antiviral mechanism of this family of proteins necessitates further examination. In this study, using both the human MARCH proteins and their mouse homologues, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the antiretroviral mechanism of this family of proteins. Moreover, we show that human MARCH proteins restrict to varying degrees the envelope glycoproteins of a diverse number of viruses. This report sheds light on the important antiviral function of MARCH proteins and their significance in cell intrinsic immunity.",Supawadee Umthong; Brian Lynch; Uddhav Timilsina; Brandon Waxman; Emily B Ivey; Spyridon Stavrou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.422953,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.422953,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
331,SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) Protein Interacts with PDZ-Domain-2 of Host Tight Junction Protein ZO1,"Newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic leading to severe respiratory disease in humans. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe respiratory dysfunction that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may effectively reduce airway barrier damage and mitigate virus spread.",Ariel Shepley-McTaggart; Cari A Sagum; Isabela Oliva; Elizabeth Rybakovsky; Katie DiGuilio; Jingjing Liang; Mark T Bedford; Joel Cassel; Marius Sudol; James M Mullin; Ronald N Harty,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.422708,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.422708,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
332,A Crystallographic Snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Maturation Process,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The dimeric form of the viral main protease is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein in 11 sites, including its own N and C-terminus. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography to characterize an immature form of the main protease. We propose that this form preludes the cis-cleavage of N-terminal residues within the dimer, leading to the mature active site. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the main protease bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during the formation of the tetramer. This quaternary form is also present in solution, suggesting a transitional state during the C-terminal trans-cleavage.

333,Discovery of Cyclic Peptide Ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein using mRNA Display,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to substantial morbidity, mortality and disruption globally. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the viral spike protein and affinity ligands to this surface protein have the potential for applications as antivirals and diagnostic reagents. Here, we describe the affinity selection of cyclic peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from three distinct libraries (in excess of a trillion molecules each) by mRNA display. We identified six high affinity molecules with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (15-550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could be used as an affinity reagent to detect spike protein in solution by ELISA, and the co-crystal structure of this molecule bound to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site, displacing a {beta}-strand near the C-terminus. Our findings provide key mechanistic insight into the binding of peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the ligands discovered in this work may find future use as reagents for diagnostic applications.",Alexander Norman; Charlotte Franck; Mary Christie; Paige Hawkins; Karishma Patel; Anneliese Ashhurst; Anupriya Aggarwal; Jason KK Low; Rezwan Siddiquee; Caroline Ashley; Megan Steain; James  A Triccas; Stuart Grant Turville; Joel Mackay; Toby Passioura; Richard J Payne,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424069,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424069,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
334,Platycodin D prevents both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by hindering membrane fusion,"An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to the global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat COVID-19, but there has been no natural product showing inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed mechanism. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Tai Young Kim; Sangeun Jeon; Youngho Jang; Lizaveta Gotina; Joungha Won; Yeon Ha Ju; Sunpil Kim; Minwoo Wendy Jang; Woojin Won; Mingu Gordon Park; Ae Nim Pae; Sunkyu Han; Seungtaek Kim; C.

335,mRNA vaccine CVnCoV protects non-human primates from SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines to meet a worldwide need. mRNA-based vaccines are the most promising technology for rapid and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and production. We have designed CVnCoV, a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated, sequence optimised mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that encodes for full length, pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein. Unlike other mRNA-based approaches, CVnCoV exclusively consists of non-chemically modified nucleotides and can be applied at comparatively low doses. Here we demonstrate that CVnCoV induces robust humoral and cellular responses in non-human primates (NHPs). Animals vaccinated with 8 g of CVnCoV were protected from challenge infection with SARS-CoV-2. Comprehensive analyses of pathological changes in challenged animals via lung histopathology and Computed Tomography (CT) scans gave no indication of enhanced disease upon CVnCoV vaccination. These results demonstrate safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of CVnCoV in NHPs that extend our previously published preclinical data and provide strong support for further clinical testing in ongoing phase 2b/3 efficacy studies.",Susanne Rauch; Karen E Gooch; Yper Hall; Francisco J Salguero; Mike J Dennis; Fergus V Gleeson; Debbie Harris; Catherine Ho; Holly E Humphries; Stephanie Longet; Didier Ngabo; Jemma Paterson; Emma L Rayner; Kathryn A Ryan; Sally Sharpe; Robert J Watson; Stefan O Mueller; Benjamin Petsch; Miles W Carroll,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424138,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424138,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False

However, the antibody persistence over 3 months post immunization and the long-term memory have been rarely reported. Here, we report that a ferritin nanoparticle based SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine induced in mice an efficient antibody response which lasts for at least 7 months post immunization. Significantly higher number of memory B cells were maintained and a significantly higher level of recall response was induced upon antigen challenge. Thus, we believe our current study provide the first information about the long-term antibody persistence and memory response of a COVID-19 vaccine.

337,"Development of a novel hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle for rapid in vitro screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies, antiviral drugs, and viral mutations","Timely development of vaccines and antiviral drugs are critical to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic 1-6. Current methods for validation of vaccine efficacy involve the use of pseudoviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) pseudotyped lentivirus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), to quantify neutralizing antibodies for blocking viral infection 7-14. The process of pseudovirus infection and quantification is time consuming and can take days to complete. In addition, pseudoviruses contain structural proteins not native to SARS-CoV-2, which may alter particle properties in receptor binding and responses to antibody neutralization 15. Here we describe the development of a new hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle (Ha-CoV-2) for rapid screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. Ha-CoV-2 is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle, composed of only SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a RNA genome derived from a fast expressing alphavirus vector 16. We demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can rapidly and robustly express reporter genes in target cells within 3-5 hours following viral entry. We further validate the Ha-CoV-2 system for rapid quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. In addition, we assembled a Ha-CoV-2 particle bearing the D614G mutant spike protein, and found that the mutation led to an approximately 200% increase in virion infectivity. These results demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can also be applied for rapid monitoring and quantification of viral mutations for effects on neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines.",Brian Hetrick; Sijia He; Linda D Chilin; Farhang Alem; Aarthi Narayanan; Alessandra Luchini; Tuanjie Li; Xuefeng Liu; Lance Liotta; Yuntao Wu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423965,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423965,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False

A single-dose 24-hour pharmacokinetic study in hamsters, a small animal model for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated that pulmonary delivery of TFF remdesivir can achieve plasma remdesivir and GS-441524 levels higher than the reported EC50s of both remdesivir and GS-441524 (in human epithelial cells) over 20 hours. The half-life of GS-4412524 following dry powder insufflation was about 7 hours, suggesting the dosing regimen would be twice daily administration. Although the remdesivir-Captisol(R) (80/20 w/w) formulation showed faster and greater absorption of remdesivir and GS-4412524 in the lung, remdesivir-leucine (80/20 w/w) exhibited a greater Cmax with shorter Tmax and lower AUC of GS-441524, indicating lower total drug exposure is required to achieve a high effective concentration against SAR-CoV-2.

339,Low vitamin K status predicts mortality in a cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"It has recently been hypothesised that Vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19. We aimed to test the hypothesis that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls; and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 140 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional Vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Fourty-three patients died within 90-days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low Vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.18).

340,Digital proximity tracing app notifications lead to faster quarantine in non-household contacts: results from the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort Study,"BackgroundDigital proximity tracing (DPT) apps may warn exposed individuals faster than manual contact tracing (MCT), leading to earlier interruption of transmission chains through quarantine. However, it is yet unclear whether these apps lead to a reduction in transmissions under real-world conditions. This study aimed at evaluating whether the SwissCovid DPT app is effective in warning close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and prompting them to quarantine earlier.

MethodsA population-based sample of adult index cases and close contacts identified through MCT and enrolled in the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort study were surveyed regarding use of the SwissCovid app and SARS-CoV-2 exposure setting. We analyzed ooutcomes related to app effectiveness and adherence (i.e., receipt and uploading of notification codes by index cases; receipt of app warnings and steps taken by close contacts). Furthermore, we performed adjusted time-to-event analyses stratified by exposure setting to estimate the effect of the app on time between relevant exposure and entering quarantine among close contacts.

FindingsWe included 393 index cases and 261 close contacts in the analysis. Among index cases using SwissCovid, 88% reported receiving and uploading a notification code in the app to trigger a warning among proximity contacts. Among close contacts using the app, 38% reported receiving an app warning due to the risk exposure. We found that non-household contacts who were notified by the app started quarantine at a median of 2 days after exposure, while those not notified started quarantine at a median of 3 days. In stratified multivariable analyses, app notified contacts had a greater probability of going into quarantine earlier than those without app notification (HR 1{middle dot}53, 95% CI 1{middle dot}15-2{middle dot}03).

InterpretationOur study showed that non-household contacts notified by the app started quarantine one day earlier than those not notified by the app. These findings constitute the first evidence that DPT may reach exposed contacts faster than MCT, leading to earlier quarantine and potential interruption of SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to examine the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of people living with Spinal cord injury (SCI) towards COVID-19 and their psychological status during in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh.

SettingThe Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), two tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

MethodsFrom July to September 2020, a prospective, cross-sectional survey of SCI subjects, 13-78 years of age, carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. Data has been collected by face to face interview through a pretested, and language validated questionnaire on KAP and Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DASS). Ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively. As all the patients were previously living with Spinal cord injury (SCI), therefore, all the patients admitted/ attend SCI rehab centers were considered as SCI positive samples.

ResultsA total of 207 people with SCI responded, 87%were male, and 13% were female with mean age34.18{+/-}12.9 years. 33.8% was tetraplegic and 66.2% was paraplegic and 63.8% of them were diagnosed ASIA-A, with motor score 45.38{+/-}19.5, sensory score 97.2{+/-}52, SpO2 95.07{+/-}3.3, and Vo2max 35.7{+/-}3.7mL/kg/min. 178 people had at least one health issue. Overall knowledge score was 8.59{+/-}2.3 out of 12, depression 11.18{+/-}8, anxiety 7.72{+/-}5.1, and stress was 9.32{+/-}6.7 from a total of 21 scores each. There was a correlation between Knowledge and DASS with age (P<.05); and Knowledge with gender (P<.05), and education (P<.01). Binary logistic regression found a higher association of Knowledge and DASS with gender (OR 6.6, 6.6, .95, 6.6; P<.01); and young age (OR.418, P<.01), illiterate (OR3.81, P<.01), and rural people (OR.48, P<.05) with knowledge. A linear relation was noted between depression and anxiety scores (r.45, P<.01) and stress scores (r.58, P<.01). A positive attitude was reported for the majority of subjects. SCI Persons reported they and the caregiver followed health advisory in consulting health professionals (65.7%), isolation (63.8%), droplet precaution (87.4%), and hygiene (90.3%).

343,Bringing COVID-19 home for Christmas: a need for enhanced testing in healthcare institutions after the holidays,"Festive gatherings this 2020 holiday season threaten to cause a surge in new cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospitals and long-term care facilities are key hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks, and may be at elevated risk as patients and staff return from holiday celebrations in the community. Some settings and institutions have proposed fortified post-holiday testing regimes to mitigate this risk. We use an existing model to assess whether implementing a single round of post-holiday screening is sufficient to detect and manage holiday-associated spikes in COVID-19 introductions to the long-term care setting. We show that while testing early helps to detect cases prior to potential onward transmission, it likely to miss a substantial share of introductions owing to false negative test results, which are more probable early in infection. We propose a two-stage post-holiday testing regime as a means to maximize case detection and mitigate the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 outbreaks into the start of the new year. Whether all patients and staff should be screened, or only community-exposed patients, depends on available testing capacity: the former will be more effective, but also more resource-intensive.",David RM Smith; Audrey Duval; Jean Ralph Zahar; Lulla Opatowski; Laura Temime,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248460,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248460,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,True
344,"Airflow and air velocity measurements while playing wind instruments, with respect to risk assessment of a SARS-CoV-2 infection","Due to airborne transmission of infection with the coronavirus, the question arose as to how high the risk of spreading infectious particles can be while playing a wind instrument.

To contribute to this question and to help clarify the possible risks, we analyzed 14 wind instruments, first qualitative by making airflows visible while playing and second quantitative by measuring air velocities at three distances (1m, 1.5m and 2m) in direction of the instruments bell.

Measurements took place with wind instrumentalists of the Bamberg Symphony in their concert hall.

Our findings highlight that while playing all wind instruments no airflow escaping from the instruments - from the bell with brass instruments, from the mouthpiece, keyholes and bell with woodwinds - was measured beyond a distance of 1.5m from the instruments bell, regardless of volume, pitch or what was played. With that, air velocity while playing corresponded to the usual value of hall-like rooms, of 0.1 m/s.

CAPTURE is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) integrating longitudinal immune profiling and clinical annotation. We evaluated 529 blood samples and 1051 oronasopharyngeal swabs from 144 cancer patients and 73 HCWs and correlated with >200 clinical variables. In patients with solid cancers and HCWs, S1-reactive and neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detectable five months post-infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were detected, and CD4+ T-cell responses correlated with S1 antibody levels. Patients with haematological malignancies had impaired but partially compensated immune responses. Overall, cancer stage, disease status, and therapies did not correlate with immune responses.

346,Dynamics of a dual SARS-CoV-2 strain co-infection on a prolonged viral shedding COVID-19 case: insights into clinical severity and disease duration,"ObjectivesA few molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 cases of symptomatic reinfection are currently known worldwide, with a resolved first infection followed by a second infection after a 48 to 142-day intervening period. We report a multiple-component study of a clinically severe and prolonged viral shedding COVID-19 case in a teenager Portuguese female. She had two hospitalisations, a total of 19 RT-PCR tests, mostly positive, and criteria for releasing from home isolation at the end of 97 days.

MethodsThe viral genome was sequenced in seven serial samples and in the diagnostic sample from an infected close relative. A human genome-wide array (>900K) was screened on the seven samples, and in vitro culture was conducted on isolates from three late samples.

ResultsThe patient had co-infection by two SARS-CoV-2 strains, affiliated in distinct clades and diverging by six variants. The 20A lineage was absolute at the diagnosis (shared with a cohabitating relative), but nine days later the 20B lineage had 3% frequency, and two months later the 20B lineage had 100% frequency. The 900K profiles confirmed the identity of the patient in the serial samples, and allowed us to infer that she had polygenic risk scores for hospitalization and severe respiratory disease within the normal distributions for a Portuguese population cohort.

347,Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 extracted from critical material from swabs,"BackgroundIn consideration of the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 cases in several countries and the resulting demand for unbiased sequencing approaches, we performed a direct RNA sequencing experiment using critical oropharyngeal swab samples collected from Italian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the Palermo region in Sicily.

MethodsHere, we identified the sequences SARS-CoV-2 directly in RNA extracted from critical samples using the Oxford Nanopore MinION technology without prior cDNA retro-transcription.

ResultsUsing an appropriate bioinformatics pipeline, we could identify mutations in the nucleocapisid (N) gene, which have been reported previously in studies conducted in other countries.

ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, the technique used in this study has not been used for SARS-CoV-2 detection previously owing to the difficulties in the extraction of RNA of sufficient quantity and quality from routine oropharyngeal swabs.

Despite these limitations, this approach provides the advantages of true native RNA sequencing, and does not include amplification steps that could introduce systematic errors.

This study can provide novel information relevant to the current strategies adopted in SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing.

348,Renin-angiotensin system blockers and mortality in COVID-19: a territory-wide study from Hong Kong,"AimsRenin-angiotensin system blockers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. In this study, the relationships between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 related mortality were examined.

MethodsConsecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority between 1st January and 28th July 2020 were included.

ResultsThis study included 2774 patients. The mortality rate of the COVID-19 positive group was 1.5% (n=42). Those who died had a higher median age (82.3[76.5-89.5] vs. 42.9[28.2-59.5] years old; P<0.0001), more likely to have baseline comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (P<0.0001). They were more frequently prescribed ACEI/ARBs at baseline, and steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine during admission (P<0.0001). They also had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher D-dimer, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that age, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, the use of ACEIs/ARBs and diuretics, and various laboratory tests remained significant predictors of mortality.

ConclusionsWe report that an association between ACEIs/ARBs with COVID-19 related mortality even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use. Patients with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting deranged clotting, renal and liver function, and increased tissue inflammation, and ACEI/ARB use have a higher mortality risk.

349,Macrolevel Association of COVID-19 with Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors in India,"ObjectiveGreater COVID-19 related mortality has been reported among persons with various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We performed an ecological study to determine the association of state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices.

MethodsWe obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics.

ResultsMore than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India at end November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearsons r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), literacy, NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r2=0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r2=0.32, 0.16) and healthcare related factors (r2=0.52, 0.38).

350,"Is Fear of COVID-19 Higher among Food-Insecure Households? A Model-Based Study, Mediated by Perceived Stress among Iranian Populations","The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis accompanied with multiple psychological consequences. This cross-sectional study, conducted on 2871 Iranians, examines how food insecurity may be associated with fear of COVID-19. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, COVID-19 fear scale, Cohens Perceived Stress Scale, and Perceived Social Support Questionnaire were used in gathering data. Data analysis was done using SPSS 22 and Amos 22. The results showed that food insecurity has significantly positive direct and indirect (mediated by perceived stress) correlations with fear of COVID-19 (P<0.05). It was also shown that perceived social support could negatively affect fear of COVID-19, through food insecurity or perceived stress (P<0.05). Among women, the presence of a child under 5 had a significant direct impact on fear of COVID-19 (P<0.05). The crisis caused by COVID-19 highlights the need for increasing social resilience through developing and implementing appropriate food security strategies.

O_TEXTBOXStatement of Relevance

The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied with multiple psychological consequences (including the fear of COVID-19), and threatens the food security status of millions of people. In order to assess the food insecurity impact on fear of COVID-19, the present study was conducted on Iranian adults. The proposed model, constructed by structural equation modeling, indicated the direct and indirect effects of food insecurity on fear of COVID-19. It was also shown that perceived social support could affect the fear of COVID-19 through food insecurity or perceived stress. It is concluded that food insecurity imposes further mental burdens during the pandemic, and policymakers should strengthen social resilience against its inter-related health consequences.

351,"Modeling effectiveness of testing strategies to prevent COVID-19 in nursing homes--United States, 2020","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes can be large with high case fatality. Identifying asymptomatic individuals early through serial testing is recommended to control COVID-19 in nursing homes, both in response to an outbreak (""outbreak testing"" of residents and healthcare personnel) and in facilities without outbreaks (""non-outbreak testing"" of healthcare personnel). The effectiveness of outbreak testing and isolation with or without non-outbreak testing was evaluated.

MethodsUsing published SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameters, the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions prevented through serial testing (weekly, every three days, or daily) and isolation of asymptomatic persons compared to symptom-based testing and isolation was evaluated through mathematical modeling using a Reed-Frost model to estimate the percentage of cases prevented through either outbreak testing alone or outbreak plus non-outbreak testing. The potential effect of simultaneous decreases (by 10%) in the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals when instituting testing strategies was also evaluated.

ResultsModeling suggests that outbreak testing could prevent 54% (weekly testing with 48-hour test turnaround) to 92% (daily testing with immediate results and 50% relative sensitivity) of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Adding non-outbreak testing could prevent up to an additional 8% of SARS-CoV-2 infections (depending on test frequency and turnaround time). However, added benefits of non-outbreak testing were mostly negated if accompanied by decreases in infection control practice.

ConclusionsWhen combined with high-quality infection control practices, outbreak testing could be an effective approach to preventing COVID-19 in nursing homes, particularly if optimized through increased test frequency and use of tests with rapid turnaround.",Isaac See; Prabasaj Paul; Rachel Slayton; Molly Steele; Matthew Stuckey; Lindsey Duca; Arjun Srinivasan; Nimalie Stone; John A Jernigan; Sujan Reddy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248255,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248255,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
352,Are college campuses superspreaders? A data-driven modeling study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present enormous challenges for colleges and universities and strategies for save reopening remain a topic of ongoing debate. Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.",Hannah Lu; Cortney Weintz; Joseph Pace; Dhiraj Indana; Kevin Linka; Ellen Kuhl,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248490,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248490,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
353,"Mental Disorder Prevalence Among Populations Impacted by Coronavirus Pandemics: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Study of COVID-19, MERS & SARS","Coronavirus pandemics are associated with a number of well-documented threats, stressors and traumas that vary by impacted population and contribute to mental disorders. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics, we investigated whether mental disorder prevalence: (a) was elevated among populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics (relative to unselected populations reported in the literature), and (b) varied by disorder (undistinguished psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare provider, quarantined). From 60 publications (N=66,190 participants), 725 individual estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. Across disorder and population, the median summary point prevalence was 20% (95%CI=17-25%). Prevalence estimates were generally substantially higher than reported by prior research for unselected samples. Psychiatric morbidity and PTSD were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults. Notably high prevalence was found for (a) psychiatric morbidity, PTSD and depression in infected/recovered adults (25-56%), (b) psychiatric morbidity and PTSD in healthcare providers (21-29%), (c) depression and PTSD in the adults in the community (15-19%), and (d) psychiatric morbidity in quarantined adults (28%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates were higher for studies/estimates: (1) focused on SARS or MERS versus COVID-19, (2) conducted in Hong Kong or Korea versus other locations, obtained (3) via questionnaire versus clinician assessment and (4) with standard versus non-standard scoring, and (5) of moderate or very low versus low quality.

354,Immune-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Severity and Chronicity Decoded Using Machine Learning,"Individuals with systemic symptoms long after COVID-19 has cleared represent approximately ~10% of all COVID-19 infected individuals. Here we present a bioinformatics approach to predict and model the phases of COVID so that effective treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 144 individuals including normal individuals and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum. We collected plasma and isolated PBMCs from 29 normal individuals, 26 individuals with mild-moderate COVID-19, 25 individuals with severe COVID-19, and 64 individuals with Chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine panel were run on all patients. Data was analyzed using machine learning methods to predict and distinguish the groups from each other.Using a multi-class deep neural network classifier to better fit our prediction model, we recapitulated a 100% precision, 100% recall and F1 score of 1 on the test set. Moreover, a first score specific for the chronic COVID-19 patients was defined as S1 = (IFN-{gamma} + IL-2)/ CCL4-MIP-1{beta}. Second, a score specific for the severe COVID-19 patients was defined as S2 = (10*IL-10 + IL-6) - (IL-2 + IL-8). Severe cases are characterized by excessive inflammation and dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While chronic patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract activated T cells.

Subjects and MethodsWe have quantified and analyzed one of the broadest set of clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death, ranging from disease related co-morbities, socioeconomic factors, healthcare capacity and government policy and interventions. Data for population, total cases, total COVID mortality, tests done, and GDP per capita were extracted from the worldometers database. Datasets for health expenditure by government, hospital beds, rural population, prevalence of smoking, prevalence of overweight population, deaths due to communicable disease and incidence of malaria were extracted from the World Bank website. Prevalence of diabetes was retrieved from the indexmundi rankings. The average population age, 60+ population, delay in lockdown, population density and BCG data were also included for analysis. The COVID-19 mortality per million and its associated factors were retrieved for 56 countries across the globe. Quantitative analysis was done at the global as well as continent level. All the countries included in the study were categorized continent and region wise for comparative analysis determining the correlation between COVID 19 mortality and the aforementioned factors.

356,COVID-19 Network Model to Evaluate Vaccine Strategies towards Herd Immunity,"With more than 60 million confirmed cases and more than 1.5 million deaths, SARS-CoV-2 has paralyzed our societies, leading to self isolation and quarantine for several months. A COVID-19 vaccine remains a critical element in the eventual solution to this public health crisis. Two vaccines are ready to be mass produced and eventually supplied to the population. Here, we develop an epidemiological network model able to represent COVID-19 pandemic dynamics of different countries such as in Italy. Stochastic computational simulations identify the necessary number of vaccines and vaccine efficacy thresholds capable of preventing an epidemic whilst adhering to lockdown guidelines. Assuming a vaccine efficacy of 100% in a mass vaccination program, at least 60% of a given population should be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity. Otherwise, new waves of COVID-19 would be reported. However, reaching 60% of the population will be an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that will take several months and millions of dollars. If the vaccine efficacy reports lower levels of efficacy in practice, then the coverage of vaccination would be needed to be even higher. Simulations suggest that the ""Ring of Vaccination"" strategy, vaccinating susceptible contact and contact of contacts, would be a more tractable vaccine strategy to prevent the new waves of COVID-19 meanwhile a high percent of the population is vaccinated.",Josephine N.

This study provides a detailed content and contributor analysis of Covid-19 related tweets among the FOAM community.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsTwitter was searched from November 1st, 2019 to March 21st, 2020 for English tweets discussing Covid-19 in the FOAM community. Tweets were classified into one of 13 pre-specified content categories: original research, editorials, FOAM resource, public health, podcast or video, learned experience, refuting false information, policy discussion, emotional impact, blatantly false information, other Covid-19, and non-Covid-19. Further analysis of linked original research and FOAM resources was performed. 1000 randomly selected contributor profiles and those deemed to have contributed false information were analyzed.

ResultsThe search yielded 8541 original tweets from 4104 contributors. The number of tweets in each content category were: 1557 other Covid-19 (18{middle dot}2%), 1190 emotional impact (13{middle dot}9%), 1122 FOAM resources (13{middle dot}1%), 1111 policy discussion (13{middle dot}0%), 928 advice (10{middle dot}9%), 873 learned experience (10{middle dot}2%), 424 non-Covid-19 (5{middle dot}0%), 410 podcast or video (4{middle dot}8%), 304 editorials (3{middle dot}6%), 275 original research (3{middle dot}2%), 245 public health (2{middle dot}9%), 83 refuting false information (1{middle dot}0%), and 19 blatantly false (0{middle dot}2%).

Methods are needed to systematically bridge this crucial gap to facilitate experimental testing of hypotheses and translation to clinical utility. Here, we leveraged cross-phenotype associations to identify traits with shared genetic architecture, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to accurately capture shared SNPs by proxy, and calculate significance of enrichment. This shared genetic architecture was examined across differing biological scales through incorporating data from catalogs of clinical, cellular, and molecular GWAS. We have created an interactive web database (interactive Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS database (iCPAGdb); http://cpag.oit.duke.edu) to facilitate exploration and allow rapid analysis of user-uploaded GWAS summary statistics. This database revealed well-known relationships among phenotypes, as well as the generation of novel hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of common diseases. Application of iCPAGdb to a recent GWAS of severe COVID-19 demonstrated unexpected overlap of GWAS signals between COVID-19 and human diseases, including with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis driven by the DPP9 locus. Transcriptomics from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that DPP9 was induced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls or those with bacterial infection. Further investigation of cross-phenotype SNPs with severe COVID-19 demonstrated colocalization of the GWAS signal of the ABO locus with plasma protein levels of a reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, CD209 (DC-SIGN), pointing to a possible mechanism whereby glycosylation of CD209 by ABO may regulate COVID-19 disease severity. Thus, connecting genetically related traits across phenotypic scales links human diseases to molecular and cellular measurements that can reveal mechanisms and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.",Liuyang Wang; Thomas J Balmat; Alejandro L Antonia; Florica J Constantine; Ricardo Henao; Thomas W Burke; Andy Ingham; Micah T McClain; Ephraim L Tsalik; Emily R Ko; Geoffrey Ginsburg; Mark DeLong; Xiling Shen; Christopher W Woods; Elizabeth R Hauser; Dennis C Ko,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248572,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
360,Kinetics of antibody responses dictate COVID-19 outcome,"Recent studies have provided insights into innate and adaptive immune dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, the exact feature of antibody responses that governs COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. Here, we analysed humoral immune responses in 209 asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-Spike (S) IgG levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. While high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time-dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than live discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed response, measured by anti-S, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, while sera from 89% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation prior to 14 days of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se, but rather with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.",Carolina Lucas; Jon Klein; Maria Sundaram; Feimei Lu; Patrick Wong; Julio Silva; Tianyang Mao; Ji Eun Oh; Maria Tokuyama; Peiwen Lu; Arvind Venkataraman; Annsea Park; Benjamin Israelow; Anne Wyllie; Chantal Vogels; M.

361,Cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with distinct transcriptomic changes within the heart,"1BackgroundAnalyses in hospitalized patients and small autopsy series suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect the heart. We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19.

MethodsLeft ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected. RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS- CoV-2 and its replication in the heart. A virus load >1000 copies per {micro}g RNA was defined as relevant. Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 age-matched cases without cardiac infection.

ResultsA relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased (43%). The median cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per {micro}g RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In situ hybridization revealed SARS- CoV-2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells. Virus detection was not associated with increased inflammatory cells. Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of the entry factor TMPRSS2. Cardiac virus replication was found in 14/95 hearts (15%). Remarkably, cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death. RNA sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction of cardiomyocytes. Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term ""extracellular exosomes"".

362,Identifying Sequential Complication and Mortality Patterns in Diabetes Mellitus: Comparisons of Machine Learning Methodologies,"BackgroundDiabetes mellitus-related complications adversely affect the quality of life. Better risk-stratified care through mining of sequential complication patterns is needed to enable early detection and prevention.

MethodsUnivariable and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant variables that can predict mortality. A sequence analysis method termed Prefixspan was applied to identify the most common couple, triple, quadruple, quintuple and sextuple sequential complication patterns in the directed comorbidity pathology network. A knowledge enhanced CPT+ (KCPT+) sequence prediction model is developed to predict the next possible outcome along the progression trajectories of diabetes-related complications.

FindingsA total of 14,144 diabetic patients (51% males) were included. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without known ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (odds ratio [OR]: 2.8, 95% CI: [2.3, 3.4]), peripheral vascular disease (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: [1.9, 2.8]), dementia (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: [1.8, 2.4]), and IHD with AMI (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: [2.1, 2.6]) are the most important multivariate predictors of mortality. KCPT+ shows high accuracy in predicting mortality (F1 score 0.90, ACU 0.88), osteoporosis (F1 score 0.86, AUC 0.82), ophthalmological complications (F1 score 0.82, AUC 0.82), IHD with AMI (F1 score 0.81, AUC 0.85) and neurological complications (F1 score 0.81, AUC 0.83) with a particular prior complication sequence.

Using a retrospective cohort design with patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, we use doubly robust regression and matching to estimate the association between use of 1-AR antagonists at time of hospitalization and likelihood of death due to COVID-19 during an inpatient stay. Having an active prescription for an 1-AR antagonist (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin) at the time of admission had a significant negative association with in-hospital mortality (relative risk reduction 14%; odds ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86; p [&le;] 0.001).

365,Population risk factors for severe disease and mortality in COVID-19: A global systematic review and meta-analysis,"AimCOVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases. While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsThe systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable.

ResultsSeventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR = 2.65 (1.81-3.90)), male sex (OR = 2.05(1.39-3.04)) and severe obesity (OR = 2.57 (1.31-5.05)). Active cancer (OR = 1.46 (1.04-2.04)) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles.

366,A New Extension of State-Space SIR Model to Account for Underreporting- An Application to the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida,"In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of infecteds are expected to remain undetected. Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they are expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, under the lack of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may be entirely different from that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be considered while estimating the parameters and forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic.

In this paper, we have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) -recovered-deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure. As a demonstration, the proposed methodology is implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida.

However, little is known about the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on confined vehicles, such as airplanes and trains. Based on the itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts among 9,265 airline passengers on 291 airplanes and 29,335 passengers on 830 high-speed trains in China from December 20, 2019 to March 17, 2020, we estimated that the upper bound of overall attack rate of COVID-19 among passengers was 0.60% (95% confidence interval: 0.43%-0.84%) for airplanes and 0.35% (0.28%-0.44%) for trains departing from Wuhan before its lockdown, respectively. The reproduction number during travel ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 on airplanes and from 0.07 to 0.12 on trains, with the risk varying by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the difference in risk was not significant between the types of aircraft and train. Overall, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on planes and high-speed trains with high efficiency air filtration devices was relatively low.

368,Airborne Transmission of Virus-Laden Aerosols inside a Music Classroom: Effects of Portable Purifiers and Aerosol Injection Rates,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shifted attention to the airborne transmission of exhaled droplet nuclei within indoor environments. The spread of aerosols through singing and musical instruments in music performances has necessitated precautionary methods such as masks and portable purifiers. This study investigates the effects of placing portable air purifiers at different locations inside a classroom, as well as the effects of different aerosol injection rates (e.g., with and without masks, different musical instruments and different injection modes). Aerosol deposition, airborne concentration and removal are analyzed in this study. It was found that using purifiers could help in achieving ventilation rates close to the prescribed values by the World Health Organization (WHO), while also achieving aerosol removal times within the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended guidelines. This could help in deciding break periods between classroom sessions, which was around 25 minutes through this study. Moreover, proper placement of purifiers could offer significant advantages in reducing airborne aerosol numbers (offering orders of magnitude higher aerosol removal when compared to nearly zero removal when having no purifiers), and improper placement of the purifiers could worsen the situation. The study suggests the purifier to be placed close to the injector to yield a benefit, and away from the people to be protected. The injection rate was found to have an almost linear correlation with the average airborne aerosol suspension rate and deposition rate, which could be used to predict the trends for scenarios with other injection rates.",Sai Ranjeet Narayanan; Suo Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248374,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248374,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

Here, we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) characterised by eight lineage-defining mutations in the spike protein, including three at important residues in the receptor-binding domain (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may have functional significance. This lineage emerged in South Africa after the first epidemic wave in a severely affected metropolitan area, Nelson Mandela Bay, located on the coast of the Eastern Cape Province. This lineage spread rapidly, becoming within weeks the dominant lineage in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape Provinces.

370,"CovidSIMVL -- Transmission Trees, Superspreaders and Contact Tracing in Agent Based Models of Covid-19","The agent-based model CovidSIMVL (github.com/ecsendmail/MultiverseContagion) is employed in this paper to delineate different network structures of transmission chains in simulated COVID-19 epidemics, where initial parameters are set to approximate spread from a single transmission source, and R0ranges between 1.5 and 2.5.

The resulting Transmission Trees are characterized by breadth, depth and generations needed to reach a target of 50% infected from a starting population of 100, or self-extinction prior to reaching that target. Metrics reflecting efficiency of an epidemic relate closely to topology of the trees.

It can be shown that the notion of superspreading individuals may be a statistical artefact of Transmission Tree growth, while superspreader events can be readily simulated with appropriate parameter settings. The potential use of contact tracing data to identify chain length and shared paths is explored as a measure of epidemic progression. This characterization of epidemics in terms of topological characteristics of Transmission Trees may complement equation-based models that work from rates of infection. By constructing measures of efficiency of spread based on Transmission Tree topology and distribution, rather than rates of infection over time, the agent-based approach may provide a method to characterize and project risks associated with collections of transmission events, most notably at relatively early epidemic stages, when rates are low and equation-based approaches are challenged in their capacity to describe or predict.

MOTIVATION - MODELS KEYED TO CONTEMPLATED DECISIONSOutcomes are altered by changing the processes that determine them. If we wish to alter contagion-based spread of infection as reflected in curves that characterize changes in transmission rates over time, we must intervene at the level of the processes that are directly involved in preventing viral spread. If we are going to employ models to evaluate different candidate arrays of localized preventive policies, those models must be posed at the same level of granularity as the entities (people enacting processes) to which preventive measures will be applied. As well, the models must be able to represent the transmission-relevant dynamics of the systems to which policies could be applied. Further, the parameters that govern dynamics within the models must embody the actions that are prescribed/proscribed by the preventive measures that are contemplated. If all of those conditions are met, then at a formal or structural level, the models are conformant with the provisions of the Law of Requisite Variety1 or the restated version of that law - the good regulator theorem.2

On a more logistical or practical level, the models must yield summary measures that are responsive to changes in key parameters, highlight the dynamics, quantify outcomes associated with the dynamics, and communicate that information in a form that can be understood correctly by parties who are adjudicating on policy options.

If the models meet formal/structural requirements regarding requisite variety, and the parameters have a plausible interpretation in relationship to real-world situations, and the metrics do not overly-distort the data contents that they summarize, then the models provide information that is directly relevant to decision-making processes. Models that meet these requirements will minimize the gap that separates models from decisions, a gap that will otherwise be filled by considerations other than the data used to create the models (for equation-based models) or the data generated by the simulations.

In this work, we present an agent-based model that targets information requirements of decision-makers who are setting policy at a local level, or translate population level directives to local entities and operations. We employ an agent-based modeling approach, which enables us to generate simulations that respond directly to the requirements of the good regulator theorem. Transmission events take place within a spatio-temporal frame of reference in this model, and rates are not conditioned by a reproduction rate (R0) that is specified a priori. Events are a function of movement and proximity. To summarize dynamics and associated outcomes of simulated epidemics, we employ metrics reflecting topological structure of transmission chains, and distributions of those structures. These measures point directly to dynamic features of simulated outbreaks, they operationalize the ""efficiency"" construct, and they are responsive to changes in parameters that govern dynamics of the simulations.",Ernie Chang; Kenneth Andrew Moselle; Ashlin Richardson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248673,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248673,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
371,"When might Host Heterogeneity Drive the Evolution of Asymptomatic, Pandemic Coronaviruses?","For most emerging infectious diseases, including SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pharmaceutical intervensions such as drugs and vaccines are not widely available, and disease surveillance followed by isolating, contact-tracing and quarantining infectious individuals is critical for controlling outbreaks. These interventions often begin by identifying symptomatic individuals. However, by actively removing pathogen strains likely to be symptomatic, such interventions may inadvertently select for strains less likely to result in symptomatic infections. Additionally, the pathogens fitness landscape is structured around a heterogeneous host pool. In particular, uneven surveillance efforts and distinct transmission risks across host classes can drastically alter selection pressures. Here we explore this interplay between evolution caused by disease control efforts, on the one hand, and host heterogeneity in the efficacy of public health interventions on the other, on the potential for a less symptomatic, but widespread, pathogen to evolve. We use an evolutionary epidemiology model parameterized for SARS-CoV-2, as the widespread potential for silent transmission by asymptomatic hosts has been hypothesized to account, in part, for its rapid global spread. We show that relying on symptoms-driven reporting for disease control ultimately shifts the pathogens fitness landscape and can cause pandemics. We find such outcomes result when isolation and quarantine efforts are intense, but insufficient for suppression. We further show that when host removal depends on the prevalence of symptomatic infections, intense isolation efforts can select for the emergence and extensive spread of more asymptomatic strains. The severity of selection pressure on pathogens caused by these interventions likely lies somewhere between the extremes of no intervention and thoroughly successful eradication. Identifying the levels of public health responses that facilitate selection for asymptomatic pathogen strains is therefore critical for calibrating disease suppression and surveillance efforts and for sustainably managing emerging infectious diseases.",Kenichi W.

373,Risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in Egyptian quarantine hospitals,"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Egypt adopted a unique care model based on quarantine hospitals for Covid-19 patients, with dedicated medical teams residing in the hospital days and nights during working shifts. However, the impact of this approach on the infection risk for healthcare workers (HCWs) is uncertain.

Based on data collected within two quarantine hospitals located in Cairo, Egypt, we compute the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers (HCWs) using a model-based approach that accounts for variability in false-negative rates of RT-PCR tests. We estimate the probability for an HCW to be infected at the end of a working shift at 12.8% (95% CrI: 7.6%-19.5%) for a 2- week shift at Hospital 1, whereas a higher probability of 48.2% (95%CrI: 23.8%-74.5%) was found for a 7-day shift at Hospital 2.

374,Preventing a cluster from becoming a new wave in settings with zero community COVID-19 cases,"In settings with zero community transmission, any new SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are likely to be the result of random incursions. The level of restrictions in place at the time of the incursion is likely to considerably affect possible outbreak trajectories. We used an agent-based model to investigate the relationship between ongoing restrictions and behavioural factors, and the probability of an incursion causing an outbreak and the resulting growth rate. We applied our model to the state of Victoria, Australia, which has reached zero community transmission as of November 2020.

We found that a future incursion has a 45% probability of causing an outbreak (defined as a 7-day average of >5 new cases per day within 60 days) if no restrictions were in place, decreasing to 23% with a mandatory masks policy, density restrictions on venues such as restaurants, and if employees worked from home where possible. A drop in community symptomatic testing rates was associated with up to a 10-percentage point increase in outbreak probability, highlighting the importance of maintaining high testing rates as part of a suppression strategy.

Because the chance of an incursion occurring is closely related to border controls, outbreak risk management strategies require an integrated approaching spanning border controls, ongoing restrictions, and plans for response. Each individual restriction or control strategy reduces the risk of an outbreak. They can be traded off against each other, but if too many are removed there is a danger of accumulating an unsafe level of risk. The outbreak probabilities estimated in this study are of particular relevance in assessing the downstream risks associated with increased international travel.",Romesh G Abeysuriya; Dominic Delport; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Rachel Sacks-Davis; Cliff C Kerr; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Margaret Hellard; Nick Scott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248595,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248595,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
375,"COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine after September 1, 2020","BackgroundThe threats of the COVID-19 pandemic require the mobilization of scientists, including mathematicians. To understand how the number of cases increases versus time, various models based on direct observations of a random number of new cases and differential equations can be used. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches should also be used, for example, some smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic in different countries and regions and to make adequate predictions of the duration, hidden periods, reproduction numbers, and final sizes of its waves. In particular, seven waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated.

ObjectiveWe will detect new epidemic waves in Ukraine that occurred after September 1, 2020 and estimate the epidemic characteristics with the use of generalized SIR model. Some predictions of the epidemic dynamics will be presented.

MethodsIn this study we use the smoothing method for the dependence of the number of cases on time; the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before.

ResultsSeventh and eights epidemic waves in Ukraine were detected and the reasons of their appearance were discussed. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated. The prediction for the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine is not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June 2021. Only mass vaccination and social distancing can change this trend.

ConclusionsNew waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical simulations. The expected long duration of the pandemic forces us to be careful and in solidarity.The government and all Ukrainians must strictly adhere to quarantine measures in order to avoid fatal consequences.",Igor Nesteruk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248627,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248627,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
376,Optimal strategies for combining vaccine prioritization and social distancing to reduce hospitalizations and mitigate COVID19 progression,"Social distancing is an effective population-level mitigation strategy to prevent COVID19 propagation but it does not reduce the number of susceptible individuals and bears severe economic and psychological consequences. A vaccine has recently been developed but its deployment will be limited and not immediate. Designing an optimal combination of these two intervention strategies is a priority, but a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between these strategies is missing. To tackle this challenge we developed an age-structured deterministic model in which vaccines are deployed during the pandemic to individuals who, in the eye of public health, are susceptible (do not show symptoms). The model allows for flexible and dynamic prioritization strategies with shifts between target groups. We find that social distancing applied uniformly to all ages and with vaccination targeted towards adults (20-59) or elderly (60+) work in synergism but up to a threshold beyond which vaccination is not efficient. The inefficiency threshold can be eliminated by targeting social distancing at the age groups that are not vaccinated and the optimal strategy is to prioritize vaccines to elderly. Nevertheless, while vaccination reduces hospitalizations, it does not affect the time it takes to eliminate the virus from the population, which is affected only by social distancing. Finally, the same reduction in hospitalization can be achieved via different combination of strategies, giving decision makers flexibility in choosing public health policies. Our study provides insights into the factors that affect vaccination success and provides methodology to test different intervention strategies in a way that will align with ethical guidelines.",Sharon Guerstein; Victoria Romeo-Aznar; Ma'ayan Dekel; Oren Miron; Nadav Davidovitch; Rami Puzis; Shai Pilosof,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248622,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248622,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
377,COVID-19 control measure effects suggest excess winter mortality is more sensitive to infection control than warmer temperatures.,"BackgroundExcess winter mortality (EWM) has been attributed to both seasonal cold exposure, and to infectious disease. In 2020, New Zealands border management and lockdown measures successfully eliminated community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and also largely eliminated influenza and many other respiratory viruses. This study investigates the contribution of infections and temperature to EWM and typical extended winter (May to October) deaths in this natural experiment created by New Zealands COVID-19 pandemic response.

MethodsWe used age-standardised weekly deaths to measure EWM 2011 to 2019, then used historical patterns to estimate high, medium and low scenario 2020 EWMs. We then modelled typical year and 2020 heating degree day: mortality relationships to estimate relative contributions of cold temperature and infection to typical EWEDs.

ResultsEWM 2011 to 2019 averaged 14.7% (low 11.4%, high 20.9%). In contrast, 2020 EWM was estimated at 1.6%, 2.7%, or 3.8% under high, medium, and low spring-summer mortality scenarios. Between 2011 and 2019, temperature was estimated to explain 47% of extended winter deaths, and infection 27%, with the remaining 26% attributable to the interaction between infection and temperature.

DiscussionThe society-wide response to COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in a major reduction of winter mortality in this high-income nation with a temperate climate. In addition to influenza, other respiratory pathogens likely also make a significant contribution to EWM. Low cost protection measures such as mask wearing (eg, in residential care facilities), discouragement of sick presenteeism, and increased influenza vaccine coverage, all have potential to reduce future winter mortality.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSExcess winter mortality (EWM) is a widely observed phenomenon, commonly attributed to physiological responses to short and long-term outdoor and indoor cold exposure (and associated increased air pollution); other seasonal physiology changes; and higher incidence of some infectious diseases. Previous estimates of EWM in New Zealand range from 10.3% to 25.6%, with influenza estimated to make up roughly a third of that excess. Internationally, deaths attributable to cold temperatures are also found outside the traditional winter period, with influenza making a large contribution to cold temperature deaths.

Added value of this studyThis study finds that following a successful COVID-19 elimination strategy, which simultaneously prevented the annual winter influenza season, and likely other winter respiratory infections, New Zealand is likely in 2020 to experience less than a third of the usual winter mortality excess. Further, this study for the first time estimates the relative contributions of cold temperature and infection, and the interaction between the two, to New Zealand winter deaths. We estimate that of the 9.5% fewer deaths than in typical years recorded between 1 May and 31 October 2020, 92.5% were prevented by infection control measures; 1.4% by the 1.14{degrees}C warmer than average winter; and 6.1% by the interaction between infection and low temperature.

Implications of all the available evidenceInfluenza and other infectious respiratory pathogens appear to make a much larger contribution to winter mortality than previously recognised. Low cost protection measures such as mask wearing (eg, in residential care facilities), discouragement of sick presenteeism, and increased influenza vaccine coverage, all have potential to reduce future winter deaths, and lower overall annual mortality rates.",Lucy Telfar-Barnard; Michael G Baker; Amanda Kvalsvig; Nick Wilson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248531,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248531,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
378,How optimal allocation of limited testing capacity changes epidemic dynamics,"Insufficient testing capacity continues to be a critical bottleneck in the worldwide fight against COVID-19. Optimizing the deployment of limited testing resources has therefore emerged as a keystone problem in pandemic response planning. Here, we use a modified SEIR model to optimize testing strategies under a constraint of limited testing capacity. We define pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic infected classes, and assume that positively tested individuals are immediately moved into quarantine. We further define two types of testing. Clinical testing focuses only on the symptomatic class. Non-clinical testing detects pre- and asymptomatic individuals from the general population, and an ""information"" parameter governs the degree to which such testing can be focused on high infection risk individuals. We then solve for the optimal mix of clinical and non-clinical testing as a function of both testing capacity and the information parameter. We find that purely clinical testing is optimal at very low testing capacities, supporting early guidance to ration tests for the sickest patients. Additionally, we find that a mix of clinical and non-clinical testing becomes optimal as testing capacity increases. At high but empirically observed testing capacities, a mix of clinical testing and unfocused (information=0) non-clinical testing becomes optimal. We further highlight the advantages of early implementation of testing programs, and of combining optimized testing with contact reduction interventions such as lockdowns, social distancing, and masking.",Justin M Calabrese; Jeffery Demers,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248431,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248431,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

380,"Modelling population-wide screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection for containing COVID-19 pandemic in Okinawa, Japan","BackgroundTo break the chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, population-wide testing is practiced in various countries. However, scant research has addressed this topic in Japan.

Materials and MethodsIn this modelling exercise, we extracted the number of daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Okinawa from October 1 to November 30, 2020 and explored possible scenarios for decreasing COVID-19 incidence by combining population-wide screening and/or social distancing policy.

ResultsWe reveal that permanent lockdown can be replaced by mass testing that mobilizes sufficient target population at an adequate frequency. In addition, solely imposing a circuit breaker will not bring a favorable outcome in the long-term, and mass testing presents implications for minimizing a period of lockdown.

Methodsthis works presents an expression to estimate the number of remaining susceptible in a population using the observed number of SARS-CoV-2 related deaths and current estimates of R0 and IFR.

This work introduces an expression to provide estimates of the number of remaining susceptible in a region using the reported number of deaths.

Conclusionsany region with fewer than 2.5 deaths per thousand individuals will continue accumulating deaths until this average is achieved, and the infection rate will exceed the removal rate until the number of deaths is about two deaths per thousand, when herd immunity is reached.

382,Routine SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance results in Turkey to follow Covid-19 outbreak,"1.A global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) declared by WHO in March 2019 is still ongoing. As of 13th of December 2020, 70 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 1.5 million people lost their lives globally (WHO, 2020). Since March 2019, diagnosis of Covid-19 cases has been done through PCR test of samples from nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. However, in March 2019, it was reported that the faeces [1] and urine [2] of all infected people contain SARS-CoV-2. Later, numerous researchers [3-7] detected SARS-CoV-2 in faeces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Moreover, some studies [1,4,8-12] suggested the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces after the patients respiratory samples tested negative. In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), i.e., wastewater surveillance, aiming to estimate the distribution of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a specific region has received worldwide attention. Various research groups worldwide [1, 13-54] have started SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater since WBE provides tracking whole population by testing a small number of wastewater samples in a specific region and can predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human faeces a few days to a week before onset of symptoms. This makes WBE quite economic tool for continual tracking of decreasing or increasing trend of the Covid-19 in a particular region. However, up to date, almost all of the WBE studies have been performed with samples from a few treatment plants. There was no reported nationwide wastewater surveillance study that has been integrated into a national Covid-19 management strategy by decision makers. Nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies have great potential to reflect the actual distribution of Covid-19 cases in a community by accounting not only symptomatic patients tested but also asymptomatic patients having no or mild symptoms and not been tested. As opposed to clinical surveillance studies, wastewater-based surveillance studies will reflect the number of cases in a community by testing one sample from a treatment plant serving this community instead of performing individual swab tests.

Turkey, which is among the few countries that started wastewater based surveillance studies at the early stages of pandemic is a leading country, performing a nationwide surveillance study. The distribution of Covid-19 cases throughout the country via SARS-CoV-2 measurements in influent, effluent and sludge samples of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in 81 cities through May 2020-June 2020 was conducted [36, 51, 52]. In June 2020, nationwide routine sampling through 22 regional identified cities has been started. However, from June to September 2020 all samples were detected negative due to problems with RT-pCR primer targeting RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Since September 2020, routine sampling from 22 cities of Turkey with 2 weeks sampling period (weekly for mega city Istanbul) has been continued and regional Covid-19 distributions have been reported as viral loads on color-scale maps. To the best our knowledge, this is the first routine nationwide surveillance study indicating Covid-19 distribution regularly using color-scale presentation on a map.",Bilge Alpaslan Kocamemi; Halil Kurt; Ahmet Sait; Hamza Kadi; Fahriye Sarac; Ismail Aydin; Ahmet Mete Saatci; Bekir Pakdemirli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248586,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248586,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

We studied risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections among people with PCD using data from the COVID-PCD, a participatory study that collects data in real-time directly from people with PCD. Data was collected using online questionnaires. A baseline questionnaire collected information on demographic data, information about the PCD diagnosis and severity. A short weekly questionnaire collected information about current symptoms and incident SARS-CoV-2 infections. 578 people participated in the COVID-PCD by December 7, 2020, with a median number of follow-up weeks of 9 (interquartile range: 4-19 weeks). 256 (45%) of the participants had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 12 tested positive prior to study entry or during study follow up (2.1% of the total included population, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-3.6%). 4 people tested positive during the study follow-up, corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.5 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.9-6.5). Overall, reported severity was mild with two reporting no symptoms, eight reporting mild symptoms, one reporting severe symptom without hospitalisation, and one reporting hospitalisation for 9 days. The study suggests that with careful personal protection, people with PCD do not seem to have an increased risk of infection with SARS-COV-2, nor an especially severe disease course.

DesignRetrospective observational study

SettingA specialist childrens hospital in the UK

PatientsInpatients aged 25 and younger treated at a specialist childrens hospital between 29 April 2019 and 6 September 2020

ResultsThere were 21,471 day cases and inpatients treated during the 16 month study period. Day cases (no overnight stay) dropped by around 37% per week. Both admissions and discharges for inpatients (at least one overnight stay) decreased leading to a small reduction in hospital bed days but no reduction in hospital bed nights. The effect on hospital activity on different patient groups varied substantially with some groups such as medical oncology day cases increasing by 13%. As a result, the patient case mix in the hospital was very different during the pandemic. Overall weekly medication administrations decreased for day cases and inpatients, but weekly medication administrations per bed day increased by 10% for day cases and 6% for inpatients.

ConclusionsDespite not being badly affected by the disease itself, specialist paediatric hospital services have been greatly affected by the pandemic. The average number of medications per inpatient bed day increased, likely reflecting changes to the patient population, with only those children with severe conditions being treated during the pandemic.

388,Factors Associated with Longitudinal Psychological and Physiological Stress in Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in psychological distress in health care workers (HCWs). There is a need to characterize which HCWs are at increased risk of psychological sequela from the pandemic.

MethodsHCWs across seven hospitals in New York City were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational digital study using the custom Warrior Watch Study App. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study measuring HRV throughout the follow up period. Surveys were obtained daily.

ResultsThree hundred and sixty-one HCWs were enrolled. Multivariable analysis found New York City COVID-19 case count to be significantly associated with increased longitudinal stress (p=0.008). A non-significant decrease in stress (p=0.23) was observed following COVID-19 diagnosis, though there was a borderline significant increase following the 4-week period after a COVID-19 diagnosis via nasal PCR (p=0.05). Baseline emotional support, baseline quality of life and baseline resilience were associated with decreased longitudinal stress (p<0.001). Baseline resilience and emotional support were found to buffer against stressors, with a significant reduction in stress during the 4-week period after COVID-19 diagnosis observed only in participants in the highest tertial of emotional support and resilience (effect estimate -0.97, p=0.03; estimate -1.78, p=0.006). A significant trend between New York City COVID-19 case count and longitudinal stress was observed only in the high tertial emotional support group (estimate 1.22, p=0.005), and was borderline significant in the high and medium resilience tertials (estimate 1.29, p=0.098; estimate 1.14, p=0.09). Participants in the highest tertial of baseline emotional support and resilience had significantly reduced amplitude and acrophase of the circadian pattern of longitudinally collected heart rate variability.

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that low resilience, emotional support, and quality of life identify HCWs at risk of high perceived longitudinal stress secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic and have a distinct physiological stress profile.

We explored changes in the effective reproduction number and the age distribution of cases, in four scenarios: (1) ""normal"": time use and contact patterns as observed historically, (2) ""pre-lockdown"": patterns as seen before the lockdown in November 2020, (3) ""lockdown"": patterns restricted as in November 2020, and (4) ""festive break"": similar to 3 but with social visits over the holiday period as in 1.

ResultsAcross ages, the estimated Reff decreases during the festive break in scenarios 1-3 and returns to pre-holiday levels in scenarios 2-3, while remaining relatively stable in scenario 4. Relative incidence is likely to decrease in children aged 0-15 but increase in other ages. Changes in age distribution were large during the holidays, and are likely to start before the holidays for individuals aged 16-24 years in scenarios 1-3.

ConclusionsOur modelling findings suggest that increased contacts during the festive period may shift the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from children towards adults. Given that COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths rise by age, more intergenerational mixing risks an increased burden in the period following the holidays.

HighlightsO_LIHome visits are associated with increased intergenerational mixing.
C_LIO_LIThe effective reproduction number is likely to remain stable or even reduce slightly due to a reduction in contacts at work and school.
C_LIO_LIRelative incidence is likely to become lower in children, but higher in the
C_LIO_LIolder (more vulnerable) age groups around the holiday period, which could lead to increased health care burden.

390,Experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analysis of risk perceptions and mental health in a student cohort,"ObjectiveThis study examined the COVID-19 risk perceptions and mental health of university students on returning to campus in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsAn online survey was completed during the first four weeks of the academic year (October 2020) by 897 university students. The survey included demographics and measures of experiences of COVID-19 testing, self-isolation, shielding, perceived risk, mental health and indices capturing related psychological responses to the pandemic.

ResultsWe observed higher levels of depression and anxiety, but not stress, in students compared with pre- pandemic normative data, but lower than levels reported earlier in the pandemic in other similar cohorts. Depression, anxiety and stress were independently associated with greater loneliness and reduced positive mood. Greater worry about COVID-19 was also independently associated with anxiety and stress. Female students and those with pre-existing mental health disorders were at greatest risk of poor mental health outcomes.

ConclusionAlthough students perceived themselves at only moderate risk of COVID-19, the prevalence of depression and anxiety among university students should remain a concern. Universities should provide adequate support for students mental health during term-time. Interventions to reduced loneliness and worry, and improve mood, may benefit students overall mental well-being.",Ru Jia; Holly Knight; Holly Blake; Jessica Corner; Chris Denning; Jonathan Ball; Kirsty Bolton; Joanne R Morling; Carol Coupland; Grazziela Figueredo; David Ed Morris; Patrick Tighe; Armando Villalon; Kieran Aylling; Kavita Vedhara,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248467,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248467,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

392,Telehealth Applied to Deliver In Situ Behavioral Skills Training to Reduce Car Seat Misuse During the CovidAcc19 Pandemic,"ObjectiveThe use of telehealth has been a common approach to deliver health education before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its ability to apply behavioral skills training (BST) for CRS education has been undocumented. This study assessed the efficacy of telehealth to deliver in-situ behavioral skills training (BST) to teach expectant parents how to install and use their child restraint system (CRS) to reduce misuse and improve retention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodA repeated measures group design was used to evaluate 171 individual participants, in a 37-step CRS task analysis for baseline, BST, and follow-up. Performance across all participants was aggregated for each task analysis. Participants were recruited from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration car seat fitting stations during the Covid-19 pandemic between March through July, 2020.

ResultsBaseline results identified significant critical misuse across participants. With BST, delivered with telehealth, misuse decreased by 97% among 37 task objectives. A 2-week follow-up evaluation concluded that 100% of participants retained the skills they mastered during BST.

ConclusionsThis study suggests the use of telehealth, as a method of BST delivery for CRS education, is an effective approach to reduce CRS misuse and the burden of child occupant motor vehicle injury. It was found to empower participants and improve their self-confidence, while ensuring the safety of their child occupant. While it was found to be an effective approach for expectant parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, it also has broader child passenger safety program and train-the-trainer implications beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jim Max DeCarli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248679,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248679,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
393,A longitudinal study of the impact of human mobility on the incidence of COVID-19 in India,"Human mobility plays a crucial role in determining how fast and where infectious diseases can spread. This study aims to investigate visit to which category of places among grocery, retail, parks, workplaces, residential, and transit stations is more associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in India. A longitudinal analysis of generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a Poisson log-linear model is employed to analyze the daily mobility rate and reported new cases of COVID-19 between March 14 and September 11, 2020. This study finds that mobility to places of grocery (food and vegetable markets, drug stores etc.) and retail (restaurants, cafes, shopping centres etc.) is significantly associated (at p<0.01) with the incidence of COVID-19. In contrast, visits to parks, transit stations and mobility within residential neighbourhoods are not statistically significant (p>0.05) in changing COVID-19 cases over time. These findings highlight that instead of blanket lockdown restrictions, authorities should adopt a place-based approach focusing on vulnerable hotspot locations to contain the COVID-19 and any future infectious disease.",Sarbeswar Praharaj; Hoon Han,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248523,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248523,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
394,"Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.",Michelle N Meyer; Tamara Gjorgjieva; Daniel Rosica,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248555,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248555,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
395,"SARS-CoV-2 infections among personnel providing home care services for the elderly in Stockholm, Sweden","BackgroundIn March 2020, Stockholm, Sweden was hit by a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Four weeks later, a systematic study of testing for past or present infections among healthcare workers in the region was launched. Only a minority of COVID-19 related deaths occurred at hospitals and the study was therefore extended to employees in companies providing home care services for the elderly.

MethodsFive companies offered participation to 438 employees at work and 405 employees (92.5%) were enrolled. Serum samples were analyzed for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and throat swabs were tested by for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR.

ResultsAmong home care employees, 20.1% (81/403) were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n=3,671; 9.7% seropositivity). Only 13/379 employees (3.4%) had evidence of a current infection (PCR positivity). Among these, 5 were also seropositive (a sign of past infection or lingering infection after symptoms have resolved) and 3 were positive with only low amounts of virus. The combination of high amounts of virus and no antibodies, a characteristic for pre-symptomatic COVID-19, was thus present only in 5 employees (1.3%).

ConclusionsPersonnel providing home service for the elderly appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employees likely to be pre-symptomatic for COVID-19 can be readily identified by screening. Increased attention for protection of employees as well as of the elderly they serve is warranted.",Sadaf Sakina Hassan; Asa Seigerud; Laila Sara Arroyo Muhr; Sara Nordqvist-Kleppe; Elisa Pin; Anna Manberg; Sophia Hober; Peter Nilsson; Lars Engstrand; Miriam Elfstrom; Jonas Blomqvist; Kalle Conneryd-Lundgren; Joakim Dillner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248511,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248511,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
396,"Active learning tools improve the learning outcomes, scientific attitude and critical thinking in higher education: Experiences in an online course during the COVID-19 pandemic","Active teaching methodologies have been placed as a hope for changing education at different levels, transiting from passive lecture-centered to student-centered learning. With the health measures of social distance, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a strong shift to remote education. With the challenge of delivering quality education through a computer screen, we validated and applied an online course model using active teaching tools for higher education. We incorporated published active-learning strategies into an online construct, with problem-based inquiry and design of inquiry research projects to serve as our core active-learning tool. The gains related to students science learning experiences and their attitudes towards science were assessed by applying questionnaires before, during and after the course. The course counted on the participation of 83 students, most of them (60,8%) from post-graduate students. Our results show that engagement provided by active learning methods can improve performance both in hard and soft skills. Students participation seems to be more relevant when activities require interaction of information, prediction and reasoning, such as open-ended questions and design of research projects. Therefore, our data shows that, in pandemic, active learning tools benefit students and improve their critical thinking and their motivation and positive positioning in science.",Izadora Volpato Rossi; Jordana Dinora de Lima; Bruna Sabatke; Maria Alice F Nunes; Graciela Evans Ramirez; Marcel I Ramirez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423922,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423922,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,False
397,LungAI: A Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Detection of COVID-19 from Posteroanterior Chest X-Rays,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of December 2020, more than 72 million cases have been reported worldwide. The standard method of diagnosis is by Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) from a Nasopharyngeal Swab. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Due to rate of spreading of the disease manual detection among people is becoming more difficult because of a clear lack of testing capability. Thus there was need of a quick and reliable yet non-labour intensive detection technique. Considering that the virus predominantly appears in the form of a lung based abnormality I made use of Chest X-Rays as our primary mode of detection. For this detection system we made use of Posteroanterior (PA) Chest X-rays of people infected with Bacterial Pneumonia (2780 Images), Viral Pneumonia (1493 Images), Covid-19 (729 Images) as well as those of perfectly Healthy Individuals (1583 Images) procured from various Publicly Available Datasets and Radiological Societies. LungAI is a novel Convolutional Neural Network based on a Hybrid of the DarkNet and AlexNet architecture. The network was trained on 80% of the dataset with 20% kept for validation. The proposed Coronavirus Detection Model performed exceedingly well with an accuracy of 99.16%, along with a Sensitivity value of 99.31% and Specificity value of 99.14%. Thus LungAI has the potential to prove useful in managing the current Pandemic Situation by providing a reliable and fast alternative to Coronavirus Detection given strong results.",Aryan Gulati,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248530,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248530,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
398,Home confinement during COVID-19 pandemic reduced physical activity but not health-related quality of life in previously active older women,"BackgroundTo investigate the effect of COVID-19 home confinement on levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in older women previously participating in exercise and educational programs.

Methods64 older women (age = 72{+/-}5 ys) who participated in a physical exercise/educational program and adhered to government home confinement recommendations have their levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior and HRQL assessed before and during (11 to 13 weeks after introduction of government recommendations to reduce virus transmission) COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsThere were significant reductions in total physical activity (-259 METs/week, P = 0.02), as a result of a [~]17.0 % reduction in walking (-30.8 min/week, P = 0.004) and [~]41.8 % reduction in vigorous-intensity activity (-29.6 min/week, P < 0.001). Sedentary behavior also increased (2.24 h/week, P < 0.001; 1.07 h/week days, P < 0.001; and 1.54 h/weekend days, P < 0.001). However, no significant change occurred in moderate-intensity physical activity, and HRQL domains and facets, except for an improvement in environment domain.

ConclusionHome confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic decreased levels of physical activity and increased levels of sedentary behavior in previously active older women who participated in an educational program. However, there were no significant changes in HRQL.

399,When months matter; modelling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnostic pathway of Motor Neurone Disease (MND),"BackgroundA diagnosis of MND takes an average 10-16 months from symptom onset. Early diagnosis is important to access supportive measures to maximise quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in NHS pathways; the majority of GP appointments now occur online with subsequent delays in secondary care assessment. Given the rapid progression of MND, patients may be disproportionately affected resulting in late stage new presentations. We used Monte Carlo simulation to model the pre-COVID-19 diagnostic pathway and then introduced plausible COVID-19 delays.

MethodsThe diagnostic pathway was modelled using gamma distributions of time taken: 1) from symptom onset to GP presentation, 2) for specialist referral, and 3) for diagnosis reached after neurology appointment. We incorporated branches to simulate delays: when patients did not attend their GP and when the GP consultation did not result in referral. An emergency presentation was triggered when diagnostic pathway time was within 30 days of projected median survival. Total time-to-diagnosis was calculated over 100,000 iterations. The pre-COVID-19 model was estimated using published data and the Improving MND Care Survey 2019. We estimated COVID-19 delays using published statistics.

ResultsThe pre-COVID model reproduced known features of the MND diagnostic pathway, with a median time to diagnosis of 399 days and predicting 5.2% of MND patients present as undiagnosed emergencies. COVID-19 resulted in diagnostic delays from 558 days when only primary care was 25% delayed, to 915 days when both primary and secondary care were 75%. The model predicted an increase in emergency presentations ranging from 15.4%-44.5%.

InterpretationsThe model suggests the COVID-19 pandemic will result in later-stage diagnoses and more emergency presentations of undiagnosed MND. Late-stage presentations may require rapid escalation to multidisciplinary care. Proactive recognition of acute and late-stage disease with altered service provision will optimise care for people with MND.

400,Minimizing cumulative risk to control airborne transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in schools,"School classrooms, where students and teachers spend prolonged periods of time, are risky environments for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV2. While countries worldwide have been pursuing different school reopening strategies, most EU countries are planning to keep schools open during the whole winter season 2020/21. However, this poses a controversial ""technical"" issue: air ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to lower down sensibly due to colder outdoor temperatures. More specifically, personnel and students will ask for more window closure during winter lessons and regulators will probably allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. A fundamental question arise: to which extent can we contain airborne risk in schools during the cold season? What would be the best mitigation strategy considering also the risk for other seasonal diseases? To try answering these questions the concept of cumulative risk is presented, showing the link between intervals of ventilation (natural or mechanical) and the lowering of aerosol contagion risk.

401,Spatial Allocation of Scarce Vaccine and Antivirals for COVID-19,"Although the COVID-19 disease burden is heterogeneous across space, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends an equitable spatial allocation of pharmaceutical interventions based, for example, on population size, in the interest of speed and workability. Utilizing economic-epidemiological modeling, we benchmark the performance of ad hoc allocation rules of scarce vaccines and drugs by comparing them to the rules for a vaccine and for a drug treatment that minimize the economic damages and expenditures over time, including a penalty cost representing the social costs of deviating from an ad hoc allocation. Under different levels of vaccine and drug scarcity, we consider scenarios where length of immunity and compliance to travel restrictions vary, and consider the robustness of the rules when assumptions regarding these factors are incorrect. Because drugs and vaccines attack different points in the disease pathology, the benefits from deviating from the ad hoc rule differ. For drug treatment, optimal policies often allocate all available treatments to one jurisdiction for a period of time, while ad hoc rules act to spread out treatments across jurisdictions. For vaccines, the benefits from deviating are especially high when immunity is permanent, when there is compliance to travel restrictions, and when the supply of vaccine is low. Interestingly, a lack of compliance to travel restrictions pushes the optimal allocations of vaccine towards the ad hoc and improves the relative robustness of the ad hoc rules, as the mixing of the populations reduces the spatial heterogeneity in disease burden.",François M.

Appropriate and timely supportive care can reduce mortality and it is critical to evolve better patient risk stratification based on simple clinical data, so as to perform effective triage during strains on the healthcare infrastructure. This study presents risk stratification and mortality prediction models based on usual clinical data from 544 COVID-19 patients from New Delhi, India using machine learning methods. An XGboost classifier yielded the best performance on risk stratification (F1 score of 0.81). A logistic regression model yielded the best performance on mortality prediction (F1 score of 0.71). Significant biomarkers for predicting risk and mortality were identified. Examination of the data in comparison to a similar dataset with a Wuhan cohort of 375 patients was undertaken to understand the much lower mortality rates in India and the possible reasons thereof. The comparison indicated higher survival rate in the Delhi cohort even when patients had similar parameters as the Wuhan patients who died. Steroid administration was very frequent in Delhi patients, especially in surviving patients whose biomarkers indicated severe disease. This study helps in identifying the high-risk patient population and suggests treatment protocols that may be useful in countries with high mortality rates.",Shanmukh Alle; Samreen Siddiqui; Akshay Kanakan; Akshit Garg; Akshaya Karthikeyan; Neha Mishra; Swati Waghdhare; Akansha Tyagi; Bansidhar Tarai; Pranjal Pratim Hazarika; Poonam Das; Sandeep Budhiraja; Vivek Nangia; Arun Dewan; Ramanathan Sethuraman; C.

403,How do Covid-19 policy options depend on end-of-year holiday contacts in Mexico City Metropolitan Area? A Modeling Study,"BackgroundWith more than 20 million residents, Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has the largest number of Covid-19 cases in Mexico and is at risk of exceeding its hospital capacity in late December 2020.

MethodsWe used SC-COSMO, a dynamic compartmental Covid-19 model, to evaluate scenarios considering combinations of increased contacts during the holiday season, intensification of social distancing, and school reopening. Model parameters were derived from primary data from MCMA, published literature, and calibrated to time-series of incident confirmed cases, deaths, and hospital occupancy. Outcomes included projected confirmed cases and deaths, hospital demand, and magnitude of hospital capacity exceedance.

FindingsFollowing high levels of holiday contacts even with no in-person schooling, we predict that MCMA will have 1{middle dot}0 million (95% prediction interval 0{middle dot}5 - 1{middle dot}7) additional Covid-19 cases between December 7, 2020 and March 7, 2021 and that hospitalizations will peak at 35,000 (14,700 - 67,500) on January 27, 2021, with a >99% chance of exceeding Covid-19-specific capacity (9,667 beds). If holiday contacts can be controlled, MCMA can reopen in-person schools provided social distancing is increased with 0{middle dot}5 million (0{middle dot}2 - 1{middle dot}0) additional cases and hospitalizations peaking at 14,900 (5,600 - 32,000) on January 23, 2021 (77% chance of exceedance).

InterpretationMCMA must substantially increase Covid-19 hospital capacity under all scenarios considered. MCMAs ability to reopen schools in mid-January 2021 depends on sustaining social distancing and that contacts during the end-of-year holiday were well controlled.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs of mid-December 2020, Mexico has the twelfth highest incidence of confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide and its epidemic is currently growing. Mexicos case fatality ratio (CFR) - 9{middle dot}1% - is the second highest in the world. With more than 20 million residents, Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has the highest number and incidence rate of Covid-19 confirmed cases in Mexico and a CFR of 8{middle dot}1%. MCMA is nearing its current hospital capacity even as it faces the prospect of increased social contacts during the 2020 end-of-year holidays. There is limited Mexico-specific evidence available on epidemic, such as parameters governing time-dependent mortality, hospitalization and transmission. Literature searches required supplementation through primary data analysis and model calibration to support the first realistic model-based Covid-19 policy evaluation for Mexico, which makes this analysis relevant and timely.

Added value of this studyStudy strengths include the use of detailed primary data provided by MCMA; the Bayesian model calibration to enable evaluation of projections and their uncertainty; and consideration of both epidemic and health system outcomes. The model projects that failure to limit social contacts during the end-of-year holidays will substantially accelerate MCMAs epidemic (1{middle dot}0 million (95% prediction interval 0{middle dot}5 - 1{middle dot}7) additional cases by early March 2021). Hospitalization demand could reach 35,000 (14,700 - 67,500), with a >99% chance of exceeding current capacity (9,667 beds). Controlling social contacts during the holidays could enable MCMA to reopen in-person schooling without greatly exacerbating the epidemic provided social distancing in both schools and the community were maintained. Under all scenarios and policies, current hospital capacity appears insufficient, highlighting the need for rapid capacity expansion.

Implications of all the available evidenceMCMA officials should prioritize rapid hospital capacity expansion.

Panel 1 and 2 consist of RT-PCR positive samples collected within two weeks and after two weeks of symptom onset, respectively. Negative samples are included in panel 3 from healthy donors and pre-pandemic dengue patients. The total assay time has been set 30 minutes for both of the ELISA assays. Results show that S1 and RBD ELISA demonstrates 73.68% and 84.21% sensitivities, respectively for samples collected within two weeks, whereas 100% sensitivities were achieved by both for samples that were collected after two weeks of the onset of symptoms. S1-ELISA shows 0% positivity to panel 3 while for RBD-ELISA the figure is 1%. A strong correlation (rs=0.804, p<0.0001)) has been observed between these two assays. When compared with NCP-ELISA, S1 slightly better correlation (rs=0.800, p<0.0001) than RBD (rs=0.740, p<0.0001). Our study suggests S1-ELISA as more sensitive one than the RBD or nucleocapsid ELISA during the later phase of infection, while for overall sero-monitoring RBD specific IgG ELISA is recommended. Moreover, non-reactivity to dengue emphasize the use of these assays for serosurveillance of COVID-19 in the dengue endemic regions.

405,Immunogenicity and crossreactivity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein,"COVID-19 patients elicit strong responses to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 but binding antibodies are also detected in prepandemic individuals, indicating potential crossreactivity with common cold human coronaviruses (HCoV) and questioning its utility in seroprevalence studies. We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV. We indentified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with HCoV that was more specific and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N also recognised N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognised SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha-rather than beta-HCoV despite having less sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in rRT-PCR negative individuals, reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer symptoms and in females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster. In conclusion, N is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2-specific and HCoV crossreactive antibodies, both of which may affect the acquisition of immunity to COVID-19.",Carlota Dobano; Rebeca Santano; Alfons Jimenez; Marta Vidal; Jordi Chi; Natalia Rodrigo Melero; Matija Popovic; Ruben Lopez-Aladid; Laia Fernandez-Barat; Marta Tortajada; Francisco Carmona-Torre; Gabriel Reina; Antoni Torres; Alfredo Mayor; Carlo Carolis; Alberto L Garcia-Basteiro; Ruth Aguilar; Gemma Moncunill; Luis Izquierdo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248551,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
406,Predicting intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among the general population using the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior Model,"BackgroundA novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March, 2020. Until such time as a vaccine becomes available, it is important to identify the determining factors that influence the intention of the general public to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine. Consequently, we aim to explore behavioral-related factors predicting intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among the general population using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model.

MethodsAn online survey was conducted among adults aged 18 years and older from May 24 to June 24, 2020. The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to the HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.

ResultsEighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB covariates as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.78). Men (OR=4.35, 95% CI 1.58-11.93), educated respondents (OR=3.54, 95% CI 1.44-8.67) and respondents who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the previous year (OR=3.31, 95% CI 1.22-9.00) stated higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR=4.49, 95% CI 2.79-7.22), of perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (OR=2.36, 95% CI 1.58-3.51) and of cues to action (OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.38-2.87), according to HBM, and if they reported higher levels of subjective norms (OR=3.04, 95% CI 2.15-4.30) and self-efficacy (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.54-2.72) according to TPB. Although half of the respondents reported they had not received influenza vaccine last year, 40% of them intended to receive influenza vaccine in the coming winter and 66% of them intended to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsProviding data on the public perspective and predicting intention for COVID-19 vaccination using HBM and TPB is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers and can help better guide compliance as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to the public.",Liora Shmueli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248587,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248587,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
407,Changes in UK hospital mortality in the first wave of COVID-19: the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol prospective multicentre observational cohort study,"BackgroundMortality rates of UK patients hospitalised with COVID-19 appeared to fall during the first wave. We quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital.

MethodsThe International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort admitted to 247 acute UK hospitals with COVID-19 in the first wave (March to August 2020). Outcome was hospital mortality within 28 days of admission. We performed a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and hospital mortality adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidity, illness severity) and quantifying potential mediators (respiratory support and steroids).

FindingsUnadjusted hospital mortality fell from 32.3% (95%CI 31.8, 32.7) in March/April to 16.4% (95%CI 15.0, 17.8) in June/July 2020. Reductions were seen in all ages, ethnicities, both sexes, and in comorbid and non-comorbid patients. After adjustment, there was a 19% reduction in the odds of mortality per 4 week period (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.79, 0.83). 15.2% of this reduction was explained by greater disease severity and comorbidity earlier in the epidemic. The use of respiratory support changed with greater use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 22.2% (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.94, 0.96) of the reduction in mortality was mediated by changes in respiratory support.

InterpretationThe fall in hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in case mix and illness severity. A significant reduction was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which may partly reflect improved clinical decision making. The remaining improvement in mortality is not explained by these factors, and may relate to community behaviour on inoculum dose and hospital capacity strain.

Key points / Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSRisk factors for mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 have been established. However there is little literature regarding how mortality is changing over time, and potential explanations for why this might be. Understanding changes in mortality rates over time will help policy makers identify evolving risk, strategies to manage this and broader decisions about public health interventions.

Added value of this studyMortality in hospitalised patients at the beginning of the first wave was extremely high. Patients who were admitted to hospital in March and early April were significantly more unwell at presentation than patients who were admitted in later months. Mortality fell in all ages, ethnic groups, both sexes and in patients with and without comorbidity, over and above contributions from falling illness severity. After adjustment for these variables, a fifth of the fall in mortality was explained by changes in the use of respiratory support and steroid treatment, along with associated changes in clinical decision-making relating to supportive interventions. However, mortality was persistently high in patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, and in those patients who received non-invasive ventilation outside of critical care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe observed reduction in hospital mortality was greater than expected based on the changes seen in both case mix and illness severity. Some of this fall can be explained by changes in respiratory care, including clinical learning. In addition, introduction of community policies including wearing of masks, social distancing, shielding of vulnerable patients and the UK lockdown potentially resulted in people being exposed to less virus.

The decrease in mortality varied depending on the level of respiratory support received. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation have persistently high mortality rates, albeit with a changing case-mix, and further research should target this group.

Severe COVID-19 disease has primarily affected older people in the UK. Many of these people, but not all have significant frailty. It is essential to ensure that patients and their families remain at the centre of decision-making, and we continue with an individualised approach to their treatment and care.",Annemarie B Docherty; Rachel H Mulholland; Nazir I Lone; Christopher P Cheyne; Daniela De Angelis; Karla Diaz-Ordaz; Cara Donoghue; Thomas M Drake; Jake Dunning; Sebastian Funk; Marta Garcia-Finana; Michelle Girvan; Hayley E Hardwick; Janet Harrison; Antonia Ho; David M Hughes; Ruth H Keogh; Peter D Kirwan; Gary Leeming; Jonathan S Nguyen-Van-Tam; Riinu Pius; Clark D Russell; Rebecca Spencer; Brian DM Tom; Lance Turtle; Peter JM Openshaw; J Kenneth Baillie; Ewen M Harrison; Malcolm G Semple,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248559,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248559,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
408,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein vaccine against COVID-19 in adults: pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials","BackgroundA safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.

MethodsWe did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085.

FindingsBetween June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 g or 50 g dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 g group) and 93% (the 50 g group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 g group and 117.8 for the 50 g group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 g group and 69.1 for the 50 g group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses. The 50 g group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 g group.

InterpretationThe protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 g vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

409,COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in South Africa: the intersection of communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases in a high HIV prevalence setting,"BackgroundThe interaction between COVID-19, non-communicable diseases, and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are unclear, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Africa. We investigated this interaction using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system in South Africa.

MethodsA national surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions (DATCOV) was established. Using DATCOV data, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and in-hospital mortality among individuals admitted to public and private hospitals with COVID-19 during 5 March to 11 August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the role of HIV-status, underlying comorbidities and their interaction on in-hospital COVID-19-associated mortality.

FindingsAmong the 41,877 individuals admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, hospital admissions peaked at 1,560 admissions per day, in late July and 7,662 (18.3%) died. Comorbidities were documented in 27,555 (65.8%) individuals, most commonly observed were hypertension (36.8%), diabetes (29.6%), obesity (19.7%), and HIV (8.7%); TB was reported in 0.7% of individuals. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with HIV and TB, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as increasing age, male sex, non-White race (Black, mixed and Indian race), chronic underlying conditions particularly hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In particular, HIV-infected individuals with immunosuppression had increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1). Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes was 39.9%. The effect of one or more comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals.

InterpretationThese data provide a better understanding of the interaction of non-communicable diseases, chronic infectious diseases like HIV and TB and COVID-19. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying comorbidities (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals. HIV- and TB-infected individuals, particularly those with additional comorbidities, would benefit from COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes.

FundingDATCOV is funded by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the South African National Government. No additional funding was obtained towards the completion of this analysis and the development of this manuscript.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in context

Evidence before this studySince the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies from Brazil, China, India, Iran, United States and several countries in Europe have identified older age, male sex and presence of underlying comorbidities including hypertension, heart disease and diabetes as risk factors for severe disease and death. There are very few studies, however, carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Africa, many of whom have high poverty rates, limited access to healthcare, and high prevalence of chronic communicable diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB). Data are also limited from settings with limited access to HIV treatment programmes. Early small cohort studies mainly from high income countries were not conclusive on whether HIV or TB are risk factors for disease severity and death in COVID-19 patients. Recent large studies from South Africas Western Cape province and the United Kingdom (UK) have found HIV-infected individuals to have a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 associated mortality. However, the UK reported risk among all confirmed cases while data from the Western Cape suggested an increase in both all confirmed cases and those admitted to hospital. Of these, only the Western Cape study presented data on mortality risk associated with presence of high viral load or immunosuppression, and found similar levels of severity irrespective of these factors. No studies reported on the interaction between HIV-infection and other non-communicable comorbidities on COVID-19 associated mortality.

We performed separate literature searches on PubMed using the following terms: ""COVID-19"" ""death risk factors"" and ""mortality""; ""HIV"" ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality""; ""TB"", ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality"". All searches included publications from December 2019 until July 12, 2020 without language restrictions. Pooled together, we identified 232 published papers. Additionally, we performed two literature searches on MedRxiv using the terms ""HIV"", ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality"", and ""TB"", ""COVID-19"" and ""mortality"" from April 25 until July 12, 2020 without language restrictions. Pooled together, we identified six pre-prints.

Added value of this studyAmong a large national cohort of over 40,000 individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in a high HIV and TB prevalence setting, we found that HIV and TB were associated with a moderately increased risk of in-hospital mortality. We found increasing risk of mortality among HIV-infected individuals with moderate/severe immunosuppression compared to those without immunosuppression. Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities was high (40%) and the effect of increasing numbers of comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals. Our study included HIV-infected individuals from all provinces in the country with varying levels of access to HIV treatment programmes. Other risk factors described elsewhere in the world such as increasing age, obesity and chronic underlying illness (particularly hypertension and diabetes) were also associated with increased mortality in this cohort.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe evidence suggests that HIV- and TB-infected individuals should be prioritised for COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes, particularly those with additional comorbidities. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying illness (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals.

410,Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations in acutely ill patients,"Dysregulated immune profiles have been described in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Whether the reported immune alterations are specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection or also triggered by other acute illnesses remains unclear. We performed flow cytometry analysis on fresh peripheral blood from a consecutive cohort of i) patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; ii) patients of comparable age/sex hospitalized for other acute disease (SARS-CoV-2 negative); and iii) healthy controls. Using both data-driven and hypothesis-driven analyses, we found several dysregulations in immune cell subsets (e.g. decreased proportion of T cells) that are similarly associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-COVID-19 related acute illnesses. In contrast, we identified specific differences in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 status (e.g. elevated proportion of ICAM-1+ mature/activated neutrophils, ALCAM+ monocytes, and CD38+CD8+ T cells). A subset of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations correlated with disease severity, disease outcome at 30 days and mortality. Our data provides novel understanding of the immune dysregulation that are specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among acute care hospitalized patients. Our study lays the foundation for the development of specific biomarkers to stratify SARS-CoV-2+ patients at risk of unfavorable outcome and uncover novel candidate molecules to investigate from a therapeutic perspective.",Rose-Marie Rebillard; Marc Charabati; Camille Grasmuck; Abdelali Filali-Mouhim; Olivier Tastet; Nathalie Brassard; Audrey Daigneault; Lyne Bourbonniere; Renaud Balthazard; Ana Carmena Moratalla; Yves Carpentier Solorio; Negar Farzam-kia; Antoine Philippe Fournier; Elizabeth Gowing; Helene Jamann; Florent Lemaitre; Victoria Hannah Mamane; Karine Thai; Jean-Franois Cailhier; Nicolas Chomont; Andres Finzi; Michael Chasse; Madeleine Durand; Nathalie Arbour; Daniel E Kaufmann; Alexandre Prat; Catherine Larochelle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248642,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248642,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
411,"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; longevity, breadth, and evasion by emerging viral variants","The SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization response and its evasion by emerging viral variants are unknown. Antibody immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and Spike variants, inhibition of Spike-driven virus-cell fusion, and infectious SARS-CoV-2 neutralization were characterized in 807 serial samples from 233 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 individuals with detailed demographics and followed up to seven months. A broad and sustained polyantigenic immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins, along with high viral neutralization were associated with COVID-19 severity. A subgroup of  high responders maintained high neutralizing responses over time, representing ideal convalescent plasma therapy donors. Antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 during the first COVID-19 wave had reduced immunoreactivity and neutralization potency to emerging Spike variants. Accurate monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses would be essential for selection of optimal plasma donors and vaccine monitoring and design.

412,Clinical outcomes and risk factors for COVID-19 among migrant populations in high-income countries: a systematic review,"BackgroundMigrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, labour migrants, and undocumented migrants, now constitute a considerable proportion of most high-income countries populations, including their skilled and unskilled workforces. Migrants may be at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their health and social circumstances, yet the extent to which they are being affected and their predisposing risk factors are not clearly understood. We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations (cases, hospitalisations, deaths), indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors.

MethodsWe did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222135). We searched databases including PubMed, Global Health, Scopus, CINAHL, and pre-print databases (medRxiv) via the WHO Global Research on COVID-19 database to Nov 18, 2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature pertaining to migrants (defined as foreign born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on our primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts, and risk factors, using narrative synthesis.

Results3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps and labour compounds may have been especially affected. In general, migrants have higher levels of many risk factors and vulnerabilities relevant to COVID-19, including increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to high-risk occupations and overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to health care including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement to healthcare coverage related to their immigration status.

ConclusionsMigrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health responses to the pandemic and should inform policymaking on strategies for reducing transmission of COVID-19 in this population. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.",Sally E Hayward; Anna Deal; Cherie Cheng; Alison F Crawshaw; Miriam Orcutt; Tushna F Vandrevala; Marrie Norredam; Manuel Carballo; Yusuf Ciftci; Ana Requena-Mendez; Chris Greenaway; Jessica Carter; Felicity Knights; Anushka Mehrotra; Farah Seedat; Kayvan Bozorgmehr; Apostolos Veizis; Ines Campos-Matos; Fatima Wurie; Teymur Noori; Martin McKee; Bernadette Kumar; Sally Hargreaves,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248475,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248475,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
413,The first wave of the Spanish COVID-19 epidemic was associated with early introductions and fast spread of a dominating genetic variant,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world since the beginning of 2020. Spain is among the European countries with the highest incidence of the disease during the first pandemic wave. We established a multidisciplinar consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, with the aim of contributing to decision making and stopping rapid spreading across the country. We present the results for 2170 sequences from the first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in Spain and representing 12% of diagnosed cases until 14th March. This effort allows us to document at least 500 initial introductions, between early February-March from multiple international sources. Importantly, we document the early raise of two dominant genetic variants in Spain (Spanish Epidemic Clades), named SEC7 and SEC8, likely amplified by superspreading events. In sharp contrast to other non-Asian countries those two variants were closely related to the initial variants of SARS-CoV-2 described in Asia and represented 40% of the genome sequences analyzed. The two dominant SECs were widely spread across the country compared to other genetic variants with SEC8 reaching a 60% prevalence just before the lockdown. Employing Bayesian phylodynamic analysis, we inferred a reduction in the effective reproductive number of these two SECs from around 2.5 to below 0.5 after the implementation of strict public-health interventions in mid March. The effects of lockdown on the genetic variants of the virus are reflected in the general replacement of preexisting SECs by a new variant at the beginning of the summer season. Our results reveal a significant difference in the genetic makeup of the epidemic in Spain and support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread even for the most successful genetic variants. Finally, earlier control of SEC7 and particularly SEC8 might have reduced the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in our country.",Mariana G.

414,From SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19 disease: a proposed mechanism for viral spread to the lower airway based on in silico estimation of virion flow rates,"While the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory airway is the dominant initial infection site for SARS-CoV-2, the physiologic mechanism that launches the infection in the lower airway is still not well-understood. Based on the rapidity with which SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to the lungs, it has been conjectured that the nasopharynx acts as the seeding zone for subsequent contamination of the lower airway via aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. In this study, we examine the plausibility of this proposed mechanism. To this end, we have developed computational fluid mechanics models of the inhalation process in two medical imaging based airway reconstructions and have quantified the nasopharyngeal liquid volume ingested into the lower airspace during each aspiration. The numerical predictions are validated by comparing the number of projected aspirations (approximately 2 - 4) during an eight-hour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3 aspirations in human subjects. Extending the numerical trends on aspiration volume to earlier records on aspiration frequency for the entire day indicates a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 0.3 - 0.76 ml per day. We then used sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients to estimate the number of virions that are transmitted daily to the lungs via nasopharyngeal liquid boluses. For mean sputum viral load, our modeling projects that the number of virions penetrating to the lower airway per day will range over 2.1 x 106 - 5.3 x 106; for peak viral load, the corresponding number of penetrating virions hovers between 7.1 x 108 - 17.9 x 108. These findings fill in a key piece of the mechanistic puzzle of the progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasopharynx to the development of COVID-19 disease within a patient, and point to dysphagia as a potential underlying risk factor for COVID-19. The findings also have significant practical implications in the design of COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics that aim to constrain the pathogenic progress of the disease within the limits of the upper airway.",Saikat Basu; Arijit Chakravarty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248544,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248544,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
415,A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis for COVID-19 Treatments,"BackgroundNumerous interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been investigated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19.

MethodsWe searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications.

ResultsWe identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta (OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI [1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28, 2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty). About two-thirds of the studies included in this NMA were rated as high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was either low or very low for most of the comparisons.

ConclusionThe Bayesian NMA identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments over SOC in terms of mortality, requirement of MV, hospital discharge and viral clearance.

416,Comparative analysis of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assays for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide and there is an urgent need to increase our diagnostic capacity to identify infected cases. Although RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, this method requires specialised equipment in a diagnostic laboratory and has a long turn-around time to process the samples. To address this, several groups have recently reported development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a simple, low cost and rapid method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Herein we present a comparative analysis of three LAMP-based assays that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab RdRP, ORF1ab nsp3 and Gene N. We perform a detailed assessment of their sensitivity, kinetics and false positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in LAMP or RT-LAMP reactions, using colorimetric or fluorescent detection. Our results independently validate that all three assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 in 30 minutes, with robust accuracy at detecting as little as 1000 RNA copies and the results can be visualised simply by color changes. We also note the shortcomings of these LAMP-based assays, including variable results with shorter reaction time or lower load of SARS-CoV-2, and false positive results in some experimental conditions. Overall for RT-LAMP detection, the ORF1ab RdRP and ORF1ab nsp3 assays have higher sensitivity and faster kinetics for detection, whereas the Gene N assay exhibits no false positives in 30 minutes reaction time. This study provides validation of the performance of LAMP-based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which have important implications in development of point-of-care diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2.",Daniel Urrutia-Cabrera; Roxanne Hsiang-Chi Liou; Jianxiong Chan; Sandy Shen-Chi Hung; Alex W Hewitt; Keith Martin; Patrick Kwan; Raymond Ching-Bong Wong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248288,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248288,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

418,SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia predicts clinical deterioration and extrapulmonary complications from COVID-19.,"BackgroundThe determinants of COVID-19 disease severity and extrapulmonary complications (EPCs) are poorly understood. We characterise the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs.

MethodsWe used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterised the role of RNAaemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression.

Findings23{middle dot}0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1{middle dot}4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAaemia 10 days after onset of symptoms, but took 16 days to reach maximum severity, and 33 days for symptoms to resolve. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6{middle dot}72 [95% CI, 2{middle dot}45 - 19{middle dot}79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2{middle dot}43 [95% CI, 1{middle dot}07 - 5{middle dot}38]), and EPCs (OR 2{middle dot}81 [95% CI, 1{middle dot}26 - 6{middle dot}36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0{middle dot}47 [95% CI, 0{middle dot}20 - 0{middle dot}67]).

InterpretationdPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAaemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe varied clinical manifestations of COVID-19 have directed attention to the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the body. Although most concentrated and tested for in the nasopharynx, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in blood, stool, and numerous tissues, raising questions about dissemination of viral RNA throughout the body, and the role of this process in disease severity and extrapulmonary complications. Recent studies have detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood using either quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (qPCR) or droplet digital PCR (dPCR), and have associated RNAaemia with disease severity and biomarkers of dysregulated immune response.

Added value of this studyWe quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx and plasma of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with COVID-19, and found an array-based dPCR platform to be markedly more sensitive than qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a simplified workflow well-suited to clinical adoption. We collected serial plasma samples during patients course of illness, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia peaks early, while clinical condition often continues to worsen. Our findings confirm the association between RNAaemia and disease severity, and additionally demonstrate a role for RNAaemia in predicting future deterioration and specific extrapulmonary complications.

Implications of all the available evidenceVariation in SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia may help explain disparities in disease severity and extrapulmonary complications from COVID-19.

420,Clustering and longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in school-children: prospective cohort study of 55 schools in Switzerland,"Background and aimsThe facilitating role of schools in SARS-CoV-2 infection spread is still debated and the potential of school closures to mitigate transmission unclear. In autumn 2020, Switzerland experienced one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe while keeping schools open, thus offering a high-exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and the evolution of clustering within classes and schools from June to November, 2020, in a prospective cohort study of school children in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland.

MethodsChildren from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited to participate in serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020. Parents of children filled questionnaires on sociodemographic and health-related questions. 55 schools and 275 classes within them were enrolled, with 2603 children participating in the first, and 2552 in the second testing (age range 6-16 years). We evaluated longitudinal changes of seroprevalence in districts and investigated clustering of seropositive cases within classes and schools.

ResultsOverall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CrI 1.4%-3.6%) in summer and 4.5% (95% CrI 3.2%-6.0%) in not previously seropositive children in late autumn, leading to estimated 7.8% (95% CrI 6.2%-9.5%) of ever seropositive children, without significant differences among lower, middle and upper school levels. Among the 2223 children with serology tested twice, 28 (40%) of previously seropositive were negative, and 109 (5%) previously negative became seropositive. Seroprevalence was not different between school levels or sexes, but varied across districts (1.7% to 15.0%). Between June-July and October-November 2020, the ratio of diagnosed to newly seropositive children was 1 to 8. At least one newly seropositive child was detected in 47 of 55 schools and 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with high participation rate, 0, 1-2 or [&ge;]3 seropositive children were present in 73 (56%), 50 (38%) and 7 (5%) classes, respectively. Class level explained slightly more variation of individual serological results (standard deviation of random effects (SD) 0.97) than school level (SD 0.61) in the multilevel logistic regression models. Symptoms were reported for 22% of seronegative and 29% of newly seropositive children since summer.

ConclusionsUnder a regimen of open schools with some preventive measures in place since August, clustering of seropositive cases occurred in very few classes and not across entire schools despite a clear increase in seropositive children during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

421,A longitudinal seroprevalence study in a large cohort of working adults reveals that neutralising SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies persist for at least six months independent of the severity of symptoms,"BackgroundIn spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wave in Europe, we set up an assay system for large-scale testing of virus-specific and protective antibodies including their longevity.

MethodsWe analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months.

FindingsWe found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG-borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising antibodies.

InterpretationRBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of both seroprevalence and seroprotection.

FundingThis study received funding from the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research within the research framework in relation to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (GZ 2020 0225 104).

Key pointsPersistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depends on their specificity. Total RBD-specific antibodies are those that are stable for up to at least six months and correlate best with neutralisation independent of the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSAt the beginning of the study (early pandemic in April 2020), the SARS-Cov-2 specific seroprevalence was totally unknown. Additionally, S1-specific antibody assays being the first on the market were tested with limited sample size showing a lower sensitivity and specificity at that time. Furthermore, at that time, there were no unambiguous interpretations of antibody test results with regard to immunity/protection against reinfection. It was also not clear whether the detection of different antibody specificities could yield an essential input into the interpretation of the antibodys qualities. Another open question was how long antibodies of the various specificities as well as antibodies with protective capacities would persist.

Added value of this studyWe provide data to confirm the most reliable correlation of RBD-specific antibodies with neutralising antibodies that are stable for at least six months. S1- and NCP-specific antibodies wane more quickly than RBD-specific antibodies, rendering them not as ideal candidates for longitudinal seroprevalence studies. Concerning symptoms, anosmia/dysgeusia was strongly associated with NT-seropositivity and seroprotection in the overall study population.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur data suggest that RBD-specific total antibody measurements with assays of high specificity can be used for cross-sectional as well as longitudinal seroepidemiological studies, even in low-prevalence settings. Detection of these antibodies also indicates robust seroprotection for at least six months. Due to the substantial loss of S1- and NCP-specific antibodies within the first months, assays targeting these antigen specificities - in contrast to RBD-specific antibody measurements - are not optimal to assess the duration of seroprotection. Overall, respiratory symptoms alone were not useful in predicting a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, anosmia/dysgeusia appeared to be a significant diagnostic marker, in particular for mild COVID-19.",Angelika Wagner; Angela Guzek; Johanna Ruff; Joanna Jasinska; Ute Scheikl; Ines Zwazl; Michael Kundi; Hannes Stockinger; Maria R.

422,Several forms of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in wastewaters : implication for wastewater-based epidemiology and risk assessment.,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a public health emergency of international concern. Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be mainly transmitted by inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols, SARS-CoV-2 is also detected in human feces and in raw wastewaters suggesting that other routes of infection may exist. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters has been proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human population connected to wastewater network. The understanding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through wastewater surveillance, the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral RNA genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment. Using an integrity based RT-qPCR assay this study led to the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist under several forms in wastewaters, which provides important information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters and associated risk assessment.

423,Social disparities in the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany: A county-scale explainable machine learning approach,"BackgroundLittle is known about factors correlated with this geographic spread of the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany. Given the lack of individual-level socioeconomic information on COVID-19 cases, we resorted to an ecological study design, exploring regional correlates of COVID-19 diagnoses.

Data and MethodWe used data from the Robert-Koch-Institute on COVID-19 diagnoses by sex, age (age groups: 0-4, 5-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, 80+), county (NUTS3 region) differentiating five periods (initial phase: through 15 March; 1st lockdown period: 16 March to 31 March; 2nd lockdown period: from 1 April to 15 April; easing period: 16 April to 30 April; post-lockdown period: 1 May through 23 July). For each period we calculated age-standardized incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses on the county level, using the German age distribution from the year 2018. We characterized the regions by macro variables in nine domains: ""Demography"", ""Employment"", ""Politics, religion, and education"", ""Income"", ""Settlement structure and environment"", ""Health care"", ""(structural) Poverty"", ""Interrelationship with other regions"", and ""Geography"". We trained gradient boosting models to predict the age-standardized incidence rates with the macro structures of the counties, and used SHAP values to characterize the 20 most prominent features in terms of negative/positive correlations with the outcome variable.

ResultsThe change in the age-standardized incidence rates over time is reflected in the changing importance of features as indicated by the mean SHAP values for the five periods. The first COVID-19 wave started as a disease in wealthy rural counties in southern Germany, and ventured into poorer urban and agricultural counties during the course of the first wave. The negative social gradient became more pronounced from the 2nd lockdown period onwards, when wealthy counties appeared to be better protected. Population density per se does not appear to be a risk factor, and only in the post-lockdown period did connectedness become an important regional characteristic correlated with higher infections. Features related to economic and educational characteristics of the young population in a county played an important role at the beginning of the pandemic up to the 2nd lockdown phase, as did features related to the population living in nursing homes; those related to international migration and a large proportion of foreigners living in a county became important in the post-lockdown period.

DiscussionIn the absence of individual level data, explainable machine learning methods based on regional data may help to better understand the changing nature of the drivers of the pandemic. High mobility of high SES groups may drive the pandemic at the beginning of waves, while mitigation measures and beliefs about the seriousness of the pandemic as well as the compliance with mitigation measures put lower SES groups at higher risks later on.",Gabriele Doblhammer; Constantin Reinke; Daniel Kreft,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248386,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248386,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
424,"Prioritizing Risk Groups for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination ""By the Numbers""","BackgroundGiven the limited supply of two COVID-19 vaccines, it will be important to choose which risk groups to prioritize for vaccination in order to get the most health benefits from that supply.

MethodIn order to help decide how to get the maximum health yield from this limited supply, we implemented a logistic regression model to predict COVID-19 death risk by age, race, and sex and did the same to predict COVID-19 case risk.

ResultsOur predictive model ranked all demographic groups by COVID-19 death risk. It was highly concentrated in some demographic groups, e.g. 85+ year old Black, Non-Hispanic patients suffered 1,953 deaths per 100,000. If we vaccinated the 17 demographic groups at highest COVID-19 death ranked by our logistic model, it would require only 3.7% of the vaccine supply needed to vaccinate all the United States, and yet prevent 47% of COVID-19 deaths. Nursing home residents had a higher COVID-19 death risk at 5,200 deaths/100,000, more than our highest demographic risk group. Risk of prison residents and health care workers (HCW) were lower than that of our demographic groups with the highest risks.

We saw much less concentration of COVID-19 case risk in any demographic groups compared to the high concentration of COVID-19 death in some such groups. We should prioritize vaccinations with the goal of reducing deaths, not cases, while the vaccine supply is low.

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 infection and thus against COVID-19 death per vaccine studies. Allocating at least some of the early vaccine supplies to high risk demographic groups could maximize lives saved.

425,A DNA INTERCALATING DYE-BASED RT-QPCR ALTERNATIVE TO DIAGNOSE SARS-COV-2,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEarly detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proven crucial during the efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several diagnostic methods have emerged in the past few months, each with different shortcomings and limitations. The current gold standard, RT-qPCR using fluorescent probes, relies on demanding equipment requirements plus the high costs of the probes and specific reaction mixes. To broaden the possibilities of reagents and thermocyclers that could be allocated towards this task, we have optimized an alternative strategy for RT-qPCR diagnosis. This is based on a widely used DNA-intercalating dye and can be implemented with several different qPCR reagents and instruments. Remarkably, the proposed qPCR method performs similarly to the broadly used TaqMan-based detection, in terms of specificity and sensitivity, thus representing a reliable tool. We think that, through enabling the use of vast range of thermocycler models and laboratory facilities for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the alternative proposed here can increase dramatically the testing capability, especially in countries with limited access to costly technology and reagents.",Federico Fuchs Wightman; Micaela Godoy Herz; Juan Cristobal Munoz; Jose Nicolas Stigliano; Laureano Bragado; Nicolas Nieto Moreno; Marcos Palavecino; Lucas Servi; Gonzalo Cabrerizo; Jose Clemente; Martin Avaro; Andrea Pontoriero; Estefania Benedetti; Elsa Baumeister; Fabian Rudolf; Federico Remes Lenicov; - COVID-19-INBIRS working group; Cybele Garcia; Valeria Buggiano; Alberto R.

426,A Working Model to Inform Risk-Based Back to Work Strategies,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many businesses to close or move to remote work to reduce the potential spread of disease. Employers desiring a return to onsite work want to understand their risk for having an infected employee on site and how best to mitigate this risk. Here, we modelled a range of key metrics to help inform return to work policies and procedures, including evaluating the benefit and optimal design of a SARS-CoV-2 employee screening program.

MethodsWe modeled a range of input variables including prevalence of COVID-19, time infected, number of employees, test sensitivity and specificity, test turnaround time, number of times tested within the infectious period, and sample pooling. We modeled the impact of these input variables on several output variables: number of healthy employees; number of infected employees; number of test positive and test negative employees; number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative employees; positive and negative predictive values; and time an infected, potentially contagious employee is on site.

ResultsWe show that an employee screening program can reduce the risk for onsite transmission across different prevalence values and group sizes. For example, at a pre-test asymptomatic community prevalence of 0.5% (5 in 1000) with an employee group size of 500, the risk for at least one infected employee on site is 91.8%, with 3 asymptomatic infected employees predicted within those 500 employees. Implementing a SARS-CoV-2 baseline screen with an 80% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity would reduce the risk of at least one infected employee on site to 39.4% and the predicted number of infected employees onsite (false negatives) to 1. Repetitive testing is required for ongoing vigilance of onsite employees. The expected number of days an infected employee is on site depends on test sensitivity, testing interval, and turnaround time. If the test interval is longer than the infectious period ([~]14 days for COVID-19), testing will not detect the infected employee. Sample pooling reduces the number of tests performed, thereby reducing testing costs. However, the pooling methodology (eg, 1-stage vs 2-stage pooling, pool size) will impact the number of employees that screen positive, thereby affected the number of employees eligible to return to onsite work.

ConclusionsThe modeling presented here can be used to help employers understand their risk for having an infected employee on site. Further, it details how an employee screening program can reduce this risk and shows how screening performance and frequency impact the effectiveness of a screening program. The primary factors determining the effectiveness of a screening program are test sensitivity and frequency of testing.

427,Development and external validation of a logistic regression derived formula based on repeated routine hematological measurements predicting survival of hospitalized Covid-19 patients,"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has become a global public health crisis and providing optimal patient care while preventing a collapse of the health care system is a principal objective worldwide.

ObjectiveTo develop and validate a prognostic model based on routine hematological parameters to predict uncomplicated disease progression to support the decision for an earlier discharge.

DesignDevelopment and refinement of a multivariable logistic regression model with subsequent external validation. The time course of several hematological variables until four days after admission were used as predictors. Variables were first selected based on subject matter knowledge; their number was further reduced using likelihood ratio-based backward elimination in random bootstrap samples.

SettingModel development based on three Austrian hospitals, validation cohorts from two Austrian and one Swedish hospital.

ParticipantsModel development based on 363 survivors and 78 non-survivors of Covid-19 hospitalized in Austria. External validation based on 492 survivors and 61 non-survivors hospitalized in Austria and Sweden.

OutcomeIn-hospital death.

Main ResultsThe final model includes age, fever upon admission, parameters derived from C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, platelet count and creatinine concentration, approximating their baseline values (CRP, creatinine) and change over time (CRP, platelet count). In Austrian validation cohorts both discrimination and calibration of this model were good, with c indices of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) in a cohort from Vienna and 0.93 (0.88 - 0.98) in one from Linz. The model performance seems independent of how long symptoms persisted before admission. In a small Swedish validation cohort, the model performance was poorer (p = 0.008) compared with Austrian cohorts with a c index of 0.77 (0.67 - 0.88), potentially due to substantial differences in patient demographics and clinical routine.

ConclusionsHere we describe a formula, requiring only variables routinely acquired in hospitals, which allows to estimate death probabilities of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The model could be used as a decision support for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system. The model could further be used to monitor whether patients should be admitted to hospital in countries with health care systems with emphasis on outpatient care (e.g. Sweden).",Stefan Heber; David Pereyra; Waltraud Schrottmaier; Kerstin Kammerer; Jonas Santol; Erich Pawelka; Markus Hana; Alexander Scholz; Markus Liu; Agnes Hell; Klara Heiplik; Benno Lickefett; Sebastian Haverall; Marianna Traugott; Matthias Neuboeck; Christian Schoergenhofer; Tamara Seitz; Christa Firbas; Mario Karolyi; Guenter Weiss; Bernd Jilma; Charlotte Thalin; Rosa Bellmann-Weiler; Helmut Salzer; Michael JM Fischer; Alexander Zoufaly; Alice Assinger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248563,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248563,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
428,How to coordinate vaccination and social distancing to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks,"The world is waiting for a vaccine to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, once it becomes available, there will not be enough to vaccinate everybody at once. Therefore, vaccination and social distancing has to be coordinated. In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision making we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run without overburdening the intensive care units it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group. Furthermore, large amounts of a vaccine with a lower success rate allows for more reduction of the social distancing than smaller amounts of a vaccine with higher success rate.",Sara Grundel; Stefan Heyder; Thomas Hotz; Tobias K.

MethodsWe recruited adult farmworkers (n=1115) between July 16, 2020 and November 30, 2020. We collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, economic and social stressors experienced during COVID-19, and willingness to be vaccinated via interviews by phone.

ResultsStudy participants, particularly female farmworkers, reported adverse effects of the pandemic on their mental health and home environment (e.g., 24% overall reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms). The pandemic also resulted in greater financial burden for many farmworkers, with 37% food insecure and 51% unable to pay bills. Half of respondents reported that they were extremely likely to be vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy was most common in participants who were women, younger, born in the United States, and living in more rural areas.

ConclusionsWe found that the pandemic has substantially impacted the mental and physical health and economic and food security of farmworkers.

430,Impact of housing conditions on changes in youth's mental health following the initial national COVID-19 lockdown: A cohort study,"BackgroundYouths mental health has on average declined initially during the pandemic and few studies have investigated whether these declines were dependent on housing conditions.

MethodsWe used data from 7445 youth from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), collected at participants 18th year of life and subsequently three weeks into the initial national lockdown (April 2020). We examined associations between housing conditions (access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition) and changes in mental health parameters (mental well-being, Quality of Life (QoL) and loneliness. We report results from multivariate linear and logistic regression models.

FindingsYouth without access to outdoor spaces had a greater decrease in mental well-being compared to those with a garden, mean difference: -0{middle dot}83 (95 % CI -1{middle dot}19,-0{middle dot}48), and correspondingly greater odds of onset of low mental well-being, OR: 1{middle dot}68 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}15, 2{middle dot}47). Youth in higher density households and those living alone also had greater odds of onset of low mental well-being (OR: 1{middle dot}23 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}05, 1{middle dot}43) and OR: 1{middle dot}47 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}05, 2{middle dot}07), respectively). Onset of low QoL was associated with living in denser households, as well as living alone. Living alone more than doubled odds of onset of loneliness, OR: 2{middle dot}12 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}59, 2{middle dot}82).

InterpretationNot all youth were equally affected by the pandemic and our findings inform policy makers that youth living alone, in denser households, and without direct access to outdoor spaces are especially vulnerable to mental health declines.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMental health is associated with certain housing characteristics, such as access to green space and household composition. Additionally, we know that mental health amongst youth has been especially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and/or social restrictions, at a time where a majority of youth spend more time at home. Cross-sectional studies have indicated that housing conditions during the initial lockdowns were associated with mental health among youth.

Added value to this studyWe are able to provide evidence that housing conditions have been important factors in how youths mental health has changed, due to data collections in our cohort before and during the pandemic. We demonstrate that living alone without access to outdoor spaces and in denser households during lockdown are all associated with deteriorations in mental health in a longitudinal design. The deteriorations in mental well-being are at a level indicative of anxiety and/or depression, indicating that these mental health changes are meaningful from a public health perspective. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine associations longitudinally in a youth cohort.

Implications of all the available evidenceNot all youth will be equally affected by the pandemic and social restrictions. Public health recommendations could be that youth avoid living alone, in dense households and without access to outdoor spaces during a lockdown, if this is at all possible to choose. Additionally, mental health and public health professionals should be aware of these vulnerabilities as they seek to assist youth at times when social restrictions are in place to control community transmission. Additionally, as we look to the future and work towards equitable and health-promoting housing, we must consider aspects that are important to mental health during pandemics and otherwise.",Jonathan Groot; Amélie Cléo Keller; Andrea Joensen; Tri-Long Nguyen; Anne-Marie Nybo Andersen; Katrine Strandberg-Larsen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
431,Population Changes in Seroprevalence among a Statewide Sample in the United States,"Antibody surveillance provides essential information for public health officials to work with communities to discuss the spread and impact of COVID-19 in communities. At the state of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the diagnostic testing was limited with many asymptomatic cases. Irrespective of symptom severity, antibodies develop within two to three weeks after disease onset and may persist 6 months or more, antibody surveillance is an important tool for tracking trends in past infections across diverse populations. This study includes adults and children recruited from a statewide sample of past 2014-2020 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) participants. SHOW, an ongoing population-based health examination study including a randomly selected sample of households, partnered with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene to conduct longitudinal antibody surveillance using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. WAVEs I and II of three planned WAVES were complete in mid-summer to late fall respectively, WAVE III is planned for early 2021. From WAVE I to WAVE II, crude estimates of seroprevalence in the total study population increased four to five-fold from 1.9% to 7.3%. Within the statewide probability sample, weighted estimates increased from an estimated 1.6% (95% CI:0.6-2.5%) seropositivity to 6.8% (95% CI:4.3-9.4%). Seroprevalence varied by health region in both waves, and significant disparities in smaller population groups were identified. Although there was no gender difference observed in WAVE I, seropositivity rates was higher in men 9.4% (95% CI:4.3, 14.3) compared to women 4.3% (2.7-5.3%) in WAVE II.

432,Assessment of effective mitigation and prediction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany using demographic information and spatial resolution,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are important to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases as long as no vaccination or outstanding medical treatments are available. We assess the effectiveness of the sets of non-pharmaceutical interventions that were in place during the course of the Coron-avirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Germany. Our results are based on hybrid models, combining SIR-type models on local scales with spatial resolution. In order to account for the age-dependence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we include realistic pre-pandemic and recently recorded contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions will occur on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. In order to account for spatial heterogeneity, we use a graph approach and we include high-quality information on commuting activities combined with traveling information from social networks. The remaining uncertainty will be accounted for by a large number of randomized simulation runs. Based on the derived factors for the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions over the past months, we provide different forecast scenarios for the upcoming time.

433,COVID-19: An analysis of social media and research publication activity during the early stages of the pandemic,"ObjectivesThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discovery. Social media (SoMe) has become an invaluable platform in science and medicine. This study analyzed activity of SoMe (Twitter), preprints, and publications related to COVID-19 and gastroenterology (GI) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsData from Twitter, preprint servers and PubMed was collected and analyzed from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity; any associations were identified.

ResultsOver the 6-month period, there were 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7,164 publications, and 4,702 preprints. Twitter activity peaked during March while preprints and publications peaked in April 2020. Strong correlations were identified between Twitter and both preprints and publications activity (p<0.001 for both). While COVID-19 data across the 3 platforms concentrated on pulmonology/critical care, the majority of GI tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal GI (LGI). There were significant associations between Twitter activity and research for all GI subfields (p=0.009 for LGI, p=0.006 for hepatology and IBD, p=0.007 for endoscopy), except pancreatology (p=0.2). Twitter activity was highest in the US (7,331 tweets) whereas PubMed activity was highest in China (1,768 publications).

MethodsWe conducted three retrospective, frequency-matched case-control studies between August 2020 and October 2020 using case data from the NHS Test and Trace programme. Controls were obtained through Market Research Panels. Multivariable analyses provided adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for multiple community exposure settings. We analysed the results in meta-analyses using random effects models to obtain pooled odds ratios (pORs).

ResultsAcross all study periods, there was strong statistical evidence that working in healthcare (pOR 2.87, aOR range 2.72-3.08), social care (pOR 4.15, aOR range 2.46-5.41) or hospitality (pOR 2.36, aOR range 2.01-2.63) were associated with increased odds of being a COVID-19 case. There was also evidence that working in warehouse setting was associated with increased odds (pOR 3.86, aOR range 1.06-14.19), with a substantial increase in odds observed over the study periods. A similar pattern was also observed in education and construction.

435,In Vitro Safety Clinical Trial of the Cardiac Liability of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as COVID19 Polytherapy,"Despite global efforts, there are no effective FDA-approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential therapeutics focus on repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. Here we report on a preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing.

Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8.. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection.

The cardiac MPS can predict clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities.

Transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent sgRNA was upregulated earlier in infection than TRS-independent sgRNA. An abundant class of TRS-independent sgRNA consisting of a portion of ORF1ab containing nsp1 joined to ORF10 and 3UTR was upregulated at 48 hours post infection in human cell lines.

Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are being published daily in various forums and this big data availability has allowed unprecedented access into the mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Genomic information has further been utilised in public health decision making through molecular epidemiology, transmission tracking and vaccine design. We made use of the same sea of genomic information for conducting a detailed phylogenetic analysis and identifying lineage- specific mutations. The catalogued mutations were analysed for their stabilizing or destabilizing impact on E, M, N and S viral proteins that are key for infection, virulence and pathogenesis. The same proteins make crucial components of vaccines recently approved and in development. We recorded positive natural selection of D614G, S477N, A222V V1176F variants and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1.

439,SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance in Costa Rica: Evidence of a Divergent Population and an Increased Detection of a Spike T1117I Mutation,"Genome sequencing is a key strategy in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. Latin America is the hardest hit region of the world, accumulating almost 25% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. Costa Rica was first exemplary for the region in its pandemic control, declaring a swift state of emergency on March 16th that led to a low quantity of cases, until measures were lifted in early May. From the first detected case in March 6th to November 30th almost 140 000 cases have been reported in Costa Rica, 99.5% of them from May onwards. We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 138 sequences, 52 from the first months of the pandemic, and 86 from the current wave.

Three GISAID clades (G, GH, and GR) and three PANGOLIN lineages (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.291) are predominant, with phylogenetic relationships that are in line with the results of other Latin American countries suggesting introduction and multiple re-introductions from other regions of the world. The sequences from the first months of the pandemic grouped in lineage B.1 and B.1.5 mainly, suggesting low undetected circulation and re-introductions of new lineages not detected in the country during early stages of the pandemic due to the extreme lockdown measures. The wholegenome variant calling analysis identified a total of 177 distinct variants. These correspond mostly to non-synonymous mutations (54.8%, 97) but 41.2% (73) corresponded to synonymous mutations. The 177 variants showed an expected power-law distribution: 106 single nucleotide mutations were identified in single sequences, only 16 single nucleotide mutations were found in >5% sequences, and only three single nucleotide mutations in >25% genomes. These mutations were distributed all over the genome. However, 61.5% were present in ORF1ab, and 15.0% in Spike gene and 9.6% in the Nucleocapsid. Additionally, the prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike (98.6% in Costa Rica), ORF8 L84S (1.5%) is similar to what is found elsewhere. Interestingly, the prevalence of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica, reaching 14.5% detection in the full genome analyses in August 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences in other countries. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggest a possible effect on the viral oligomerization needed for cell infection. Nevertheless, in-vitro experiments are required to prove this in-silico analyses. In conclusion, genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggests re-introduction of lineages from other countries as travel bans and measures were lifted, similar to results found in other studies, but the Spike-T1117I variant needs to be monitored and studied in further analyses as part of the surveillance program during the pandemic.",Jose Arturo Molina Mora Sr.; Estela Cordero-Laurent; Adriana Godinez; Melany Calderon; Hebleen Brenes; Claudio Soto-Garita; Cristian Perez-Corrales; - COINGESA-CR Consorcio Interinstitucional de Estudios Genomicos del SARS-CoV-2 Costa Rica; Jan Felix Drexler; Andres Moreira-Soto; Eugenia Corrales-Aguilar; Francisco Duarte-Martinez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423850,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423850,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,False
440,"SARS-CoV-2 testing of 11,884 healthcare workers at an acute NHS hospital trust in England: a retrospective analysis","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are known to be at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, although whether these risks are equal across all roles is uncertain. Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A logistic regression model adjusting for these factors showed significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk. Robust informatics solutions for HCW exposure data are essential to inform occupational monitoring.",Aidan T. Hanrath; Ina Schim van der Loef; Dennis W. Lendrem; Kenneth F. Baker; David A.

441,"T cell activation, highly armed cytotoxic cells and a sharp shift in monocytes CD300 receptors expression is characteristic of patients with severe COVID-19","COVID-19 manifests with a wide diversity of clinical phenotypes characterized by dysfunctional and exaggerated host immune responses. Many results have been described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized. In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical features and clinical laboratory values of patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets, higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing abrupt change in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity.

442,Analyzing the vast coronavirus literature with CoronaCentral,"The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a surge in research exploring all aspects of the virus and its effects on human health. The overwhelming rate of publications means that human researchers are unable to keep abreast of the research.

To ameliorate this, we present the CoronaCentral resource which uses machine learning to process the research literature on SARS-CoV-2 along with articles on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We break the literature down into useful categories and enable analysis of the contents, pace, and emphasis of research during the crisis. These categories cover therapeutics, forecasting as well as growing areas such as ""Long Covid"" and studies of inequality and misinformation. Using this data, we compare topics that appear in original research articles compared to commentaries and other article types. Finally, using Altmetric data, we identify the topics that have gained the most media attention.

443,"Safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 (a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial) and the persistence of immune responses from a phase 1 follow-up report","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 {micro}g or 6 {micro}g) formulated with a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG). Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152: 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG.

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion ([&ge;]4-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT50). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose).

FindingsAmong 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92{middle dot}9% (88{middle dot}2, 96{middle dot}2) and 98{middle dot}3% (95{middle dot}1, 99{middle dot}6) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6{middle dot}9, 13{middle dot}2) and 10.3% (7{middle dot}4, 13{middle dot}8) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73{middle dot}5% (63{middle dot}6, 81{middle dot}9), 81{middle dot}1% (71{middle dot}4, 88{middle dot}1), and 73{middle dot}1% (62{middle dot}9, 81{middle dot}8) of individuals in the 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 {micro}g with Algel groups, respectively.

InterpretationIn the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The safety profile of BBV152 is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates. The 6 {micro}g Algel-IMDG formulation was selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial.

444,"Minimizing exposure to respiratory droplets, 'jet riders' and aerosols in air-conditioned hospital rooms by a 'Shield-and-Sink' strategy","ObjectivesIn COVID-19, transfer of respiratory materials transmits disease but the interplay of droplet and aerosol physics, physiology and environment is not fully understood. To advance understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and to find novel exposure minimization strategies, we studied cough-driven material transport modes and the efficacy of control strategies.

Design and methodsComputer simulations and real-world experiments were used for integrating an intensive care setting, multi- physics, and physiology. Patient-focused airflow management and air purification strategies were examined computationally and validated by submicron particle exhalation imaging in volunteers.

ResultsRespiratory materials ejected by cough exhibited four transport modes: long-distance ballistic, short- distance ballistic, ""jet rider"", and aerosol modes. Interaction with air conditioning driven flow contaminated a hospital room rapidly. Different than large droplets or aerosols, ""jet rider"" droplets travelled with the turbulent air jet initially, but fell out at a distance, were not well eliminated by air conditioning and exposed bystanders at larger distance and longer time; their size predisposes them to preferential capture in the nasal mucosa, the primordial COVID-19 infection site. ""Cough shields"" captured large droplets but induced lateral dispersion of aerosols and jet riders. An air purification device alone had limited efficacy. A ""Shield and Sink"" approach combining ""cough shields"" with ""virus sinks"" miminized exposure to all secretions in modeling and real-life experiments.

Conclusions""Jet riders"" have characteristics of highly efficient respiratory infection vectors and may play a role in Covid- 19 transmission. Exposure to all droplet types can be minimized through an easily implemented ""Shield and Sink"" strategy.

A concern for the development of new viral vaccines is the potential to induce vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). This was reported in several preclinical studies with both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS vaccines but has not been reported with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We have used ferret and rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to assess the potential for VED in animals vaccinated with formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (FIV) formulated with Alhydrogel, compared to a negative control vaccine in ferrets or unvaccinated macaques. We showed no evidence of enhanced disease in ferrets or rhesus macaques given FIV except for mild transient enhanced disease seen at seven days post infection in ferrets. This increased lung pathology was observed early in the infection (day 7) but was resolved by day 15.

446,A recombinant protein SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine elicits high-titer neutralizing antibodies in macaques.,"Vaccines that generate robust and long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently required. We assessed the potential of vaccine candidates based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike in cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) by examining their ability to generate spike binding antibodies with neutralizing activity. Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the NTD alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the RBD but not the NTD had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans. Neutralizing activity persisted for more than 20 weeks.

447,Fatty Acid Synthase inhibition prevents palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 SpikeProtein and improves survival of mice infected with murine hepatitis virus.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the causative agent of COVID19 that has infected >76M people and caused >1.68M deaths. The SARS-CoV2 Spike glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment and infection of target cells. The viral Spike protein serves the basis for many putative therapeutic countermeasures including vaccines, blocking and neutralizing antibodies, and decoy receptors. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. The Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues conserved among coronavirus. Increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper-palmitoylation, while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced the ability of the human CoV 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase using the pharmacological inhibitor TVB-3166 eliminated palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 Spike. Additionally, TVB-3166 attenuated plaque formation and promoted the survival of mice from a lethal murine CoV infection. Thus, inhibition of the Spike protein palmitoylation has the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV infections.",Minhyoung Lee; Katrina Mekhail; Michael Sugiyama; Elyse Latreille; Costin N Antonescu; Greg D Fairn,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423603,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423603,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
448,In vitro measurements of protein-protein interactions show that antibody affinity governs the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 binding in convalescent serum,"The humoral immune response plays a key role in suppressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2-spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the binding energies of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein, and the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential areas of application ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.",Sebastian Fiedler; Monika A.

To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patients cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-{kappa}B/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Bijesh George; Ravikumar Amjesh; Aswathy Mary Paul; Santhosh Kumar TR; Madhavan Radhakrishna Pillai; Rakesh Kumar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423733,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423733,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
450,From infection to immunity: understanding the response to SARS-CoV2 through in-silico modeling,"BackgroundImmune system conditions of the patient is a key factor in COVID-19 infection survival. A growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for therapies.

AimThe dynamics of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of the both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and therapies. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the management of the infection: can we describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19? The in-silico model developed here answers this question at individual (personalized) and population levels.

We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity to the ACE2 receptor and age in the artificially infected population on the course of the disease.

MethodsWe use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of infected individuals with age-dependent varying degree of immune competence. We use a parameter setting to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics.

ResultsWe reproduce in-silico a number of clinical observations and we identify critical factors in the statistical evolution of the infection. In particular we evidence the importance of the humoral response over the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection is a prognostic factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection.

Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of simulating the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed is able to explain and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions.

Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes in a quantitative way that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population.

In this work we i) show the power of model predictions, ii) identify the clinical end points that could be more suitable for computational modeling of COVID-19 immune response, iii) define the resolution and amount of data required to empower this class of models for translational medicine purposes and, iv) we exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important light to discuss hypothesis and design new experiments.",Filippo Castiglione; Debashrito Deb; Anurag P.

451,"Prevalent, protective, and convergent IgG recognition of SARS-CoV-2 non-RBD spike epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent plasma","Although humoral immunity is essential for control of SARS-CoV-2, the molecular composition, binding epitopes and effector functions of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that circulate in blood plasma following infection are unknown. Proteomic deconvolution of the circulating IgG repertoire (Ig-Seq1) to the spike ectodomain (S-ECD2) in four convalescent study subjects revealed that the plasma response is oligoclonal and directed predominantly (>80%) to S-ECD epitopes that lie outside the receptor binding domain (RBD). When comparing antibodies directed to either the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) or the S2 subunit (S2) in one subject, just four IgG lineages (1 anti-S2, 2 anti-NTD and 1 anti-RBD) accounted for 93.5% of the repertoire. Although the anti-RBD and one of the anti-NTD antibodies were equally potently neutralizing in vitro, we nonetheless found that the anti-NTD antibody was sufficient for protection to lethal viral challenge, either alone or in combination as a cocktail where it dominated the effect of the other plasma antibodies. We identified in vivo protective plasma anti-NTD antibodies in 3/4 subjects analyzed and discovered a shared class of antibodies targeting the NTD that utilize unmutated or near-germline IGHV1-24, the most electronegative IGHV gene in the human genome. Structural analysis revealed that binding to NTD is dominated by interactions with the heavy chain, accounting for 89% of the entire interfacial area, with germline residues uniquely encoded by IGHV1-24 contributing 20% (149 [A]2).

452,Binding strength and hydrogen bond numbers between Covid-19 RBD and HVR of antibody,"The global battle against the Covid-19 pandemic relies strongly on the human defence of antibody, which is assumed to bind the antigens Receptor Binding Domain with its Hypervariable Region. Due to the similarity to other viruses such as SARS, however, our understanding of the antibody-virus interaction has been largely limited to the genomic sequencing, which poses serious challenges to the containment, vaccine exploration and rapid serum testing. Based on the physical/chemical nature of the interaction, infrared spectroscopy was employed to reveal the binding disparity, when unusual temperature dependence was discovered from the 1550cm-1 absorption band, attributed to the hydrogen bonds by carboxyl/amino groups, binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. The infrared absorption intensity, associated with the number of hydrogen bonds, was found to increase sharply between 27{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, with the relative absorbance matches at 37{degrees}C the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types (19 vs 12). Meanwhile the ratio of bonds at 27{degrees}C, calculated by thermodynamic exponentials rather than by the laymans guess, produces at least 5% inaccuracy. As a result, the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody will be more conclusive beyond 31{degrees}C, instead of at the usual room temperature of 20{degrees}C - 25{degrees}C, when the vaccine research and antibody diagnosis would likely be undermined. Beyond genomic sequencing, the temperature dependence, as well as the bond number match at 37{degrees}C between relative absorbance and the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types, are not only of clinical significance in particular, but also of a sample for the physical/chemical understanding of the vaccine-antibody interactions in general.",Ryan Taoran Wang; Alex Fan Xu; Qi Zhou; Tinglu Song; Kelvin J.

453,The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein disrupts the cooperative function of human cardiac pericytes - endothelial cells through CD147 receptor-mediated signalling: a potential non-infective mechanism of COVID-19 microvascular disease,"BackgroundSevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests as a life-threatening microvascular syndrome. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction.

MethodsWe investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes (PCs) signalling and function. Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells (ECs) in angiogenesis assays, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs.

FindingsWe show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs. Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein.

InterpretationOur findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implication.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. Co-receptors and host cell proteases may also be involved. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the well-recognized entry receptor used by the virus in respiratory epithelial cells; it is also abundantly expressed in the human heart. Alongside ACE2, CD147 has recently emerged as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, it is not clear if SARS-CoV-2 triggers adverse responses in cardiac vascular mural cells. Likewise, no investigation was devoted to verifying if the recombinant S protein alone can mimic the whole virus signalling.

Added value of this studyThis study provides the first evidence that the recombinant S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is capable of eliciting cellular signalling in human cardiac pericytes, thereby inducing cell dysfunction. In addition, this study proposes CD147 as the leading receptor mediating S protein signalling in cardiac pericytes.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese reports imply that fragments of the S protein might be able to elicit vascular cell dysfunction. Blocking the CD147 receptor may help protect the vasculature not only from infection, but also from the collateral damage caused by the S protein.",Elisa Avolio; Monica Gamez; Kapil Gupta; Rebecca Foster; Imre Berger; Massimo Caputo; Andrew  D.

Here we show that the combination of a powerful erythroid-specific expression system and transgene codon optimization yields high expression levels of the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5, as well as a CD4-glycophorin A (CD4-GpA) fusion protein on enucleated RBCs. Engineered RBCs expressing CD4 and CCR5 were efficiently infected by HIV-1, but CD4 or CD4-GpA expression in the absence of CCR5 was sufficient to potently neutralize HIV-1 in vitro. To facilitate continuous large-scale production of engineered RBCs, we generated erythroblast cell lines stably expressing CD4-GpA or ACE2-GpA fusion proteins, which produced potent RBC viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

455,pH and Receptor Induced Confirmational Changes- Implications Towards S1 Dissociation of SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoprotein,"Viruses, being obligate intracellular parasites, must first attach themselves and gain entry into host cells. Viral fusion machinery is the central player in the viral attachment process in almost every viral disease. Viruses have incorporated an array of efficient fusion proteins on their surfaces to bind efficiently to host cell receptors. They make use of the host proteolytic enzymes to rearrange their surface protein(s) into the form which facilitates their binding to host-cell membrane proteins and subsequently, fusion. This stage of viral entry is very critical and has many therapeutic implications. The current global pandemic of COVID-19 has sparked severe health crisis and economic shutdowns. SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent of the disease has led to millions of deaths and brought the scientific community together in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis and mortality. Like other viral fusion machinery, CoV2 spike (S) glycoprotein-  The Demogorgon poses the same questions about viral-host cell fusion. The intermediate stages of S protein-mediated viral fusion are unclear owing to the lack of structural insights and concrete biochemical evidence. The mechanism of conformational transition is still unclear. S protein binding and fusion with host cell receptors, Eg., angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is accompanied by cleavage of S1/S2 subunits. To track the key events of viral-host cell fusion, we have identified (in silico) that low pH-induced conformational change and ACE-2 binding events promote S1 dissociation.

Those are often thought to have resulted from peoples carelessness or people not following restrictions, but in reality, the cause remains unclear. Here, using an objective analytical method, we present the changes in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19 over time. The virus has mutated in three major directions 2, with three groups remaining to date. The basic structure of the groups was completed by April and shared across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of a second or third peak. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of which the virus overcame previously effective protections. Currently, each country may possess such a unique stronger variant, which may cause another peak in other countries. These viruses could also serve as sources of mutations by exchanging parts of the genome. Such mutations could create a variant with superior infectivity.",Tomokazu Konishi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.413344,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.413344,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False

Here we show that Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), a quaternary ammonium compound present in many oral mouthwashes, reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by inhibiting viral fusion with target cells. We also found that CPC and CPC-containing mouth rinses decreased a thousand times the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, while the corresponding vehicles had no effect.

458,Mutation Landscape of SARS COV2 in Africa,"COVID-19 disease has had a relatively less severe impact in Africa. To understand the role of SARS CoV2 mutations on COVID-19 disease in Africa, we analysed 282 complete nucleotide sequences from African isolates deposited in the NCBI Virus Database. Sequences were aligned against the prototype Wuhan sequence (GenBank accession: NC_045512.2) in BWA v. 0.7.17. SAM and BAM files were created, sorted and indexed in SAMtools v. 1.10 and marked for duplicates using Picard v. 2.23.4. Variants were called with mpileup in BCFtools v. 1.11. Phylograms were created using Mr. Bayes v 3.2.6. A total of 2,349 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles across 294 sites were identified. Clades associated with severe disease in the United States, France, Italy, and Brazil had low frequencies in Africa (L84S=2.5%, L3606F=1.4%, L3606F/V378I/=0.35, G251V=2%). Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) accounted for only 3% of P323L and 4% of Q57H mutations in Africa. Comparatively low infections in SSA were attributed to the low frequency of the D614G clade in earlier samples (25% vs 67% global). Higher disease burden occurred in countries with higher D614G frequencies (Egypt=98%, Morocco=90%, Tunisia=52%, South Africa) with D614G as the first confirmed case. V367F, D364Y, V483A and G476S mutations associated with efficient ACE2 receptor binding and severe disease were not observed in Africa. 95% of all RdRp mutations were deaminations leading to CpG depletion and possible attenuation of virulence.

459,Predicting COVID-19 cases with unknown homogeneous or heterogeneous resistance to infectivity,"This article constructs a restricted infection rate inverse binomial-based approach to predict COVID-19 cases after a family gathering. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is unqualified to match the reality of COVID-19, because the data contradicts the models requirement that variance should be greater than expected value. A refined version of the IB model is a necessity to predict COVID-19 cases after family gatherings. Our refined version of an IB model is more appropriate and versatile, as it accommodates all potential data scenarios: equal, lesser, or greater variance than expected value.

Application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on Fan et al.s COVID-19 data, which exhibits two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases increases and vice versa. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is appropriate for Cluster 1. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75 among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Conversely, Cluster 2, exhibits smaller variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying the number of primary and secondary cases increase or decrease together. Cluster 2 disqualifies the traditional IB model and demands its refined version. Probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.74 among the primary, but is 0.72 among the secondary in Cluster 2, with a narrower gap.

The models ability to estimate the communitys health system memory for future policies to be developed is an asset of this approach. The current hazard level to be infected with COVID-19 among the primary and secondary groups are estimable and interpretable.

Author SummaryCurrent statistical models are not able to accurately predict disease infection spread in the COVID-19 pandemic. We have applied a widely-used inverse binomial method to predict rates of infection after small gatherings, going from primary (original) cases to secondary (later) cases after family gatherings or social events, using the data from the Wuhan and Gansu provinces in China, where the virus first spread. The advantages of the proposed approach include that the models ability to estimate the communitys health system memory for future policies to be developed, as such policies might reduce COVIDs spread if not its control. In our approach, as demonstrated, the current hazard level of becoming infected with COVID-19 and the odds of contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable and interpretable. We hope the proposed approach will be used in future epidemics.",Ramalingam Shanmugam; Gerald Ledlow; Karan  P.

460,"The challenges of the coming mass vaccination and exit strategy in prevention and control of COVID-19, a modelling study","With success in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, it is urgent and challenging to analyse how the coming large-scale vaccination in the population and the growing public desire of relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) interact to impact the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using mathematical models, we focus on two aspects: 1) how the vaccination program should be designed to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs; 2) how much the vaccination coverage is needed to avoid a second wave of the epidemics when the NPIs exit in stages. We address this issue globally, and take six countries--China, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, UK, and US--in our case study. We showed that a dynamic vaccination program in three stages can be an effective approach to balance the dynamic exit of the NPIs in terms of mitigating the epidemics. The vaccination rates and the accumulative vaccination coverage in these countries are estimated by fitting the model to the real data. We observed that the required effective vaccination coverages are greatly different to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs in these countries, providing a quantitative criterion for the requirement of an integrative package of NPIs. We predicted the epidemics under different vaccination rates for these countries, and showed that the vaccination can significantly decrease the peak value of a future wave. Furthermore, we found that a lower vaccination coverage can result in a subsequent wave once the NPIs exit. Therefore, there is a critical (minimum) vaccination coverage, depending on effectiveness of NPIs to avoid a subsequent wave. We estimated the critical vaccination coverages for China, Brazil, and Indonesia under different scenarios. In conclusion, we quantitatively showed that the dynamic vaccination program can be the effective approach to supplement or even eventually replace NPIs in mitigating the epidemics and avoiding future waves, and we suggest that country level-based exit strategies of the NPIs should be considered, according to the possible quarantine rate and testing ability, and the accessibility, affordability and efficiency of the vaccines.",Biao Tang; Peiyu Liu; Jie Yang; Jianhong Wu; Yanni Xiao; Sanyi Tang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248478,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248478,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
461,Real-world data suggest antibody positivity to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a decreased risk of future infection,"ImportanceThere is limited evidence regarding whether the presence of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a decreased risk of future infection. Understanding susceptibility to infection and the role of immune memory is important for identifying at-risk populations and could have implications for vaccine deployment.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to evaluate subsequent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) among individuals who are antibody-positive compared with those who are antibody-negative, using real-world data.

DesignThis was an observational descriptive cohort study.

ParticipantsThe study utilized a national sample to create cohorts from a de-identified dataset composed of commercial laboratory test results, open and closed medical and pharmacy claims, electronic health records, hospital billing (chargemaster) data, and payer enrollment files from the United States. Patients were indexed as antibody-positive or antibody-negative according to their first SARS-CoV-2 antibody test recorded in the database. Patients with more than 1 antibody test on the index date where results were discordant were excluded.

Main Outcomes/MeasuresPrimary endpoints were index antibody test results and post-index diagnostic NAAT results, with infection defined as a positive diagnostic test post-index, as measured in 30-day intervals (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, >90 days). Additional measures included demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics at the time of the index antibody test, such as recorded signs and symptoms or prior evidence of COVID-19 (diagnoses or NAAT+) and recorded comorbidities.

ResultsWe included 3,257,478 unique patients with an index antibody test. Of these, 2,876,773 (88.3%) had a negative index antibody result, 378,606 (11.6%) had a positive index antibody result, and 2,099 (0.1%) had an inconclusive index antibody result. Patients with a negative antibody test were somewhat older at index than those with a positive result (mean of 48 versus 44 years). A fraction (18.4%) of individuals who were initially seropositive converted to seronegative over the follow up period. During the follow-up periods, the ratio (CI) of positive NAAT results among individuals who had a positive antibody test at index versus those with a negative antibody test at index was 2.85 (2.73 - 2.97) at 0-30 days, 0.67 (0.6 - 0.74) at 31-60 days, 0.29 (0.24 - 0.35) at 61-90 days), and 0.10 (0.05 - 0.19) at >90 days.

ConclusionsPatients who display positive antibody tests are initially more likely to have a positive NAAT, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but over time become markedly less likely to have a positive NAAT. This result suggests seropositivity using commercially available assays is associated with protection from infection. The duration of protection is unknown and may wane over time; this parameter will need to be addressed in a study with extended duration of follow up.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan real-world data be used to evaluate the comparative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for individuals who are antibody-positive versus antibody-negative?

FindingOf patients indexed on a positive antibody test, 10 of 3,226 with a NAAT (0.3%) had evidence of a positive NAAT > 90 days after index, compared with 491 of 16,157 (3.0%) indexed on a negative antibody test.

462,Public adherence to governmental recommendations regarding quarantine and testing for COVID-19 in two Norwegian cohorts,"BackgroundCombatting the COVID-19 pandemic relies at present on non-pharmacological interventions. Governments are using various approaches from general advice to full lockdown. There is a need to describe and understand adherence to public health actions.

MethodsParticipants from two ongoing cohorts, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and The Norwegian Influenza Pregnancy Cohort (NorFlu), answered questionnaires every 14 days since March 2020. From the summer of 2020, testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 became easily available. Recommendations were that respiratory symptoms should lead to testing, and that confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be followed by quarantine. We estimated the adherence to these guidelines in responses from cohort participants in the period August to October 2020.

ResultsLess than 40% of men who were ill and less than 45% of women who were ill, tested themselves for SARS-CoV-2 during the same 14-day periods. Among subjects tested for COVID-19, about 53% of men and 59% of women reported quarantine. For subjects with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, the proportions quarantined were 65% for men and 72% for women.

ConclusionsPublic adherence to governmental recommendations regarding testing and quarantine were lower than expected in a country with high trust in government.

463,An expedited approach towards the rationale design of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors with in vitro antiviral activity,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. In this study, we report an expedited drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR) reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. The most potent compound 23R had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376. Our designs were guided by overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R), a non-covalent inhibitor derived from Ug-4CR, with the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + calpain inhibitor XII/GC376/UAWJ247. Binding site analysis suggests a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementary with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Lead optimization led to the discovery of 23R, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC50 of 0.31 M and EC50 of 1.27 M, respectively. The binding and specificity of 23R to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were confirmed in a thermal shift assay and native mass spectrometry assay. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed the P2 biphenyl fits snuggly into the S2 pocket and the benzyl group in the -methylbenzyl faces towards the core of the enzyme, occupying a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study revealed the most potent non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors reported to date and a novel binding pocket that can be explored for Mpro inhibitor design.",Naoya Kitamura; Michael Dominic Sacco; Chunlong Ma; Yanmei Hu; Julia Townsend; Xiangzhi Meng; Fushun Zhang; Xiujun Zhang; Adis Kukuljac; Michael Marty; David Schultz; Sara Cherry; Yan Xiang; Yu Chen; Jun Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423537,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423537,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,False
464,"Mental health among pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, a mixed methods approach using data from the Mom2B mobile application for research","Public health emergencies such as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have significant impact on mental health, and have been shown to impact on already prevalent affective disorders during and after pregnancy. The aim of this study was to utilize modern tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as wellbeing and life changes in pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, where no lockdown has been in place.

Data from the Mom2B, a national ongoing mobile application-based study of pregnant and newly-delivered women were utilized. Participants (n= 1345) filled out self-report screeners of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Questions about COVID symptoms and effects on life and health care were added from March 2020. Movement data was collected using the phones GPS sensor. Mood scores were compared with throughout the months of 2020 and to the levels of a previous collected material. Highest levels of depression and anxiety were evident in April and October 2020. Symptoms were higher among those feeling socially isolated, but not for those infected or with symptomatic family members. Wellbeing and mobility were strongly positively correlated and were lowest in April. Women reported on cancelled healthcare appointments and worry about their partners being absent from the delivery.

The Mom2B application enabled gathering information at a national level in real-time as the pandemic has been evolving. Levels of perinatal affective symptoms and low wellbeing were elevated compared with previous years as well as with months with fewer cases of SARS-Cov-2. Similar applications can help healthcare providers and governmental bodies to in real time monitor high-risk groups during crises, as well as to adjust measures and the support offered.

Longitudinal analyses of more than 11,000 participants across the UK found no association between lower adherence to face covering guidelines and poorer mental health. The opposite appears to be true. Even after controlling for behavioral, social, and psychological confounds, including measures of pre-pandemic mental health, individuals who wore face coverings ""most of the time"" or ""always"" had better mental health and wellbeing than those who did not. These results suggest that wearing face coverings more often will not negatively impact mental health.",Drew M Altschul; Chloe Fawns-Ritchie; Alex Kwong; Louise Hartley; Clifford Nangle; Rachel Edwards; Rebecca Dawson; Christie Levein; Archie Campbell; Robin Flaig; Andrew McIntosh; Ian Deary; Riccardo Marioni; Caroline Hayward; Cathie Sudlow; Elaine Douglas; David Bell; David Porteous,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248477,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248477,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
466,The polybasic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike modulates viral sensitivity to Type I IFN and IFITM2,"The cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses types 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) requires sequential protease processing of the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the S precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons, and more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2 and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH- and cathepsin-dependent in late endosomes where, like SARS-CoV-1 S, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we find that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs.

IMPORTANCEThe furin cleavage site in the S protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2, and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423592,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423592,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,False
467,Sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters conferred by a novel recombinant subunit vaccine,"A safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential to avert the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed a subunit vaccine, which is comprised of CHO-expressed spike ectodomain protein (StriFK) and nitrogen bisphosphonates-modified zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH002C). This vaccine candidate rapidly elicited the robust humoral response, Th1/Th2 balanced helper CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell immune response in animal models. In mice, hamsters, and non-human primates, 2-shot and 3-shot immunization of StriFK-FH002C generated 28- to 38-fold and 47- to 269-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than the human COVID-19 convalescent plasmas, respectively. More importantly, the StriFK-FH002C immunization conferred sterilizing immunity to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which also protected animals from virus-induced weight loss, COVID-19-like symptoms, and pneumonia in hamsters. Vaccine-induced neutralizing and cell-based receptor-blocking antibody titers correlated well with protective efficacy in hamsters, suggesting vaccine-elicited protection is immune-associated.

468,A comprehensive transcriptome analysis reveals broader but weaker host response of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV,"COVID-19, which has resulted a worldwide health crisis with more than 74.9 million confirmed cases worldwide by December 2020, is caused by a newly emerging coronavirus identified and named SARS-CoV-2 in February in Wuhan, China. Experiences in defeating SARS, which infested during 2002-2003, can be used in treating the new disease. However, comparative genomics and epidemiology studies have shown much difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which underlies the different clinical features and therapies in between those two diseases. Further studies comparing transcriptomes infected by these two viruses to uncover the differences in host responses would be necessary. Here we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infected human cell lines, including Caco-2, Calu-3, H1299. Clustering analysis and expression of ACE2 show that SARS-CoV-2 has broader but weaker infection, where the largest discrepancy occurs in the epithelial lung cancer cell, Calu-3. SARS-CoV-2 genes also show less tissue specificity than SARS-CoV genes. Furthermore, we detected more general but moderate immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected transcriptomes by comparing weighted gene co-expression networks and modules. Our results suggest a different immune therapy and treatment scheme for COVID-19 patients than the ones used on SARS patients.

469,The impact of the first UK Covid-19 lockdown on carers and people living with low prevalence dementia: results from the Rare Dementia Support survey,"IntroductionThe public health measures imposed to contain Covid-19 during the first UK lockdown resulted in significant changes in the provision of community support and care for people with dementia. People with low prevalence and young-onset dementias often experience non-memory, behavioural or neuropsychiatric symptoms that require specialised support.

ObjectiveWe explored the impact of the first Covid-19 lockdown on people living with low prevalence and young-onset dementia and their carers in the UK.

MethodAn online survey, including eleven questions about the impact of the lockdown on both the person with dementia and their family caregivers was conducted. Participants were people living with dementia and caregivers who are members of the UK national-reach organisation Rare Dementia Support.

Results184 carers and 24 people with dementia completed the survey. People with dementia experienced worsening of cognitive symptoms (70%), ability to do things (62%) and well-being (57%) according to their carers. Carers also reported a reduction in the support received for caring (55%). 93% of carers of people living in care homes reported a reduction in their ability to provide care. 26% of carers reported changes in the medication of the person with dementia during the lockdown. 74% of people with dementia reported decreased ability to connect with people socially.

ConclusionsPeople with dementia experienced a worsening of dementia symptoms, removal of support and increased difficulty to connect with other people socially during the 1st wave of Covid-19. Carers encountered barriers to both receiving and providing support and a decline in their own mental health and well-being.

Key pointsO_LI70 % of carers reported cognitive symptoms getting worse during the lockdown (e.g., the person with dementia being more disoriented and finding it more difficult to communicate).
C_LIO_LI26 % of carers reported a change (initiation or increase) in medication in the person with dementia during the lockdown.
C_LIO_LI79 % carers reported their own physical or mental health getting worse due to the lockdown. This increased to 93% when considering responses only from family carers of people living in care homes.
C_LIO_LI93 % of family carers of people living in care homes found it harder to continue providing care and support for their relative due to Covid-19.

We then tested if rare pLOF variants in these 13 genes were associated with severe COVID-19. We identified only one rare pLOF mutation across these genes amongst 713 cases with severe COVID-19 and observed no enrichment of pLOFs in severe cases compared to population controls or mild COVID-19 cases.

However, beyond their protective function, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may also participate in disease pathogenesis. To explore the potential relationship between virus-specific humoral responses and COVID-19 immunopathology, we measured serum antibody classes and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleoprotein in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We found that RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG3 dominated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, were more abundant in severe patients, and positively correlated with several clinical parameters of inflammation. In contrast, a virus-specific IgA2 response skewed toward RBD rather than NP associated with a more favorable clinical course.

In this paper, we have evaluated the effects of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Results have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known effects of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein) and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids).

The risk factors do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, so it is possible that genetic factors could account for novel insights into its pathogenesis.

In our previous study, we hypothesized that common variants on chromosome 21, near TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes, may be genetic risk factors associated to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show suggestive associations (P[&le;]1x10-5) with severe COVID-19. All five SNPs replicated the association in two independent cohorts of Asian subjects while two and one out of the 5 SNPs replicated in African and Italian populations, respectively (P[&le;]0.05). The minor alleles of these five SNPs correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and increased level of MX1 expression in blood.

All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 31 were asymptomatic carriers, 149 were symptomatic patients, and 14 were presymptomatic patients. Compared to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower levels of C-reactive protein and viral load, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (P=0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (P=0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic than presymptomatic patients.

The S-protein furin-like motifs PRRAR685{downarrow} and KPSKR815{downarrow} indicated that proprotein convertases promote virus entry. We demonstrate that furin and PC5A induce cleavage at both sites, ACE2 enhances S2 processing, and their pharmacological inhibition (BOS-inhibitors) block endogenous cleavages. S1/S2-mutations (S1/S2) limit S-protein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, similarly to BOS-inhibitors. Unexpectedly, TMPRSS2 does not cleave at S1/S2 or S2, but it can: (i) cleave/inactivate S-protein into S2a/S2b; (ii) shed ACE2; (iii) cleave S1-subunit into secreted S1, activities inhibited by Camostat. In lung-derived Calu-3 cells, BOS-inhibitors and {micro}S1/S2 severely curtail ""pH-independent"" viral entry, and BOS-inhibitors alone/with Camostat potently reduce infectious viral titer and cytopathic effects.

While great strides have been made toward understanding and combating the mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, relatively little is known about the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins that contribute to pathogenicity during infection and that cause neurological sequela after viral clearance. We used Drosophila to develop an in vivo model that characterizes mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and found ORF3a adversely affects longevity and motor function by inducing apoptosis and inflammation in the nervous system. Chloroquine alleviated ORF3a induced phenotypes in the CNS, arguing our Drosophila model is amenable to high throughput drug screening. Our work provides novel insights into the pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system that can be used to develop new treatment strategies for post-viral syndrome.

482,Fast and scalable lipid nanoparticle formulation of niclosamide (nano NCM) effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro,"As exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, highly infective respiratory viruses can spread rapidly in the population because of lack of effective approaches to control viral replication and spread. Niclosamide (NCM) is an old anthelminthic drug (World Health Organization essential medicine list) with pleiotropic pharmacological activities. Several recent publications demonstrated that NCM has broad antiviral activities and potently inhibits viral replication, including replication of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and dengue viruses.

483,Longitudinal omics in Syrian hamsters integrated with human data unravel complexity of moderate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2,"In COVID-19, the immune response largely determines disease severity and is key to therapeutic strategies. Cellular mechanisms contributing to inflammatory lung injury and tissue repair in SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly endothelial cell involvement, remain ill-defined. We performed detailed spatiotemporal analyses of cellular and molecular processes in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Comparison of hamster single-cell sequencing and proteomics with data sets from COVID-19 patients demonstrated inter-species concordance of cellular and molecular host-pathogen interactions. In depth vascular and pulmonary compartment analyses (i) supported the hypothesis that monocyte-derived macrophages dominate inflammation, (ii) revealed endothelial inflammation status and T-cell attraction, and (iii) showed that CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses precede viral elimination.

485,Genetic Conservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Replication Complex in Globally Circulating Isolates from Humans and Minks Predicts Minimal Pre-Existing Resistance to Remdesivir,"Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, > 90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates and >300 from mink isolates collected through early September 2020 were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in [&ge;]0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in [&ge;]0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time predicts a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.",Ross Martin; Jason Perry; Tomas Cihlar; Hongmei Mo; Danielle P Porter; Evguenia S Svarovskaia,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423600,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423600,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,False
486,Oxygen saturation instability in suspected covid-19 patients; contrasting effects of reduced VA/Q and shunt.,"Patients in the UK at risk of Covid-19 pneumonia, but not needing immediate hospital attention, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify at home deterioration in oxygen saturation (SaO2 or SpO2). A recent finding in Covid-19 pneumonia is a dominant reduction in VA/Q. A mathematical model of gas exchange was used to examine the effect of reduction of VA/Q or increase in shunt on SaO2 stability inferred from the slope of the PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersects the line representing ambient PIO2. Reduced VA/Q predicted SpO2 instability breathing air, e.g. a {+/-}1 kPa change in PIO2 gave an 8% change in SpO2 at a VA/Q of 0.4 but a 1.5% change in SpO2 with a 15% shunt. As a consistency check, two patients with pre-existing lung disease and 12 hour continuous SpO2 monitoring breathing air had gas exchange impairment analysed in terms of shunt and reduced VA/Q. The patient with 16% shunt and normal VA/Q had a stable but reduced SpO2 (circa 93%) throughout the 12 hr period. The patient with a VA/Q reduced to 0.48 had SpO2 ranging from 75-95% during the same period. SpO2 monitoring in suspected covid-19 patients should focus on SpO2 varying >5% in 30 minutes. Such instability in at risk patients is not diagnostic of Covid -19 pneumonia but this may be suspected from a dominant reduction in VA/Q if episodic hypoxaemia has progressed from a stable SpO2.",John Gareth Jones,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248126,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248126,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True

It is indicated that many of the people with mild symptoms and positive test results are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in some regions. It is also concluded that current and foreseen alternative tests cannot be used to ""clear"" patients, students or workers as being non-infected.

488,Risk Factors for SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity in a Health Care Worker Population,"BackgroundProtecting health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is essential. Serologic testing can identify HCWs who had minimally symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that were missed by occupational screening based on daily symptom and temperature checks. Recent studies report conflicting results regarding the impact of occupational factors on SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity amongst HCWs.

MethodsThe study population included all hospital workers at an academic medical center in Orange County, California. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed from a fingerstick blood specimen using a coronavirus antigen microarray, which compares IgM and IgG antibodies against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens with positive and negative controls to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with 98% specificity and 93% sensitivity. Demographic, occupational, and clinical factors were surveyed and their effect on seropositivity estimated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

ResultsAmongst 1,557 HCWs with complete data, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 10.8%. Risk factors for increased seropositivity included male gender, exposure to COVID-19 outside of work, working in food or environmental services, and working in COVID-19 units. Amongst the 1,103 HCW who were seropositive but missed by occupational screening, additional risk factors included younger age and working in administration.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is significantly higher than reported case counts even amongst HCWs who are meticulously screened. Seropositive HCWs missed by occupational screening were more likely to be younger, work roles without direct patient care, or have COVID-19 exposure outside of work.

Key PointsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity risk factors amongst health care workers included male gender, nonoccupational exposure, food or environmental services role, and COVID-19 unit location.

489,Longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients shows age-associated T cell changes independent of ongoing ill-health,"The trajectory of immunological and inflammatory changes following acute COVID-19 infection are unclear. We investigate immunological changes in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate their potential relationships with persistent symptoms, termed long COVID.

We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise tolerance were assessed and investigated their relationship with convalescent results.

We demonstrate persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance were common but were not associated with immunological changes.

490,Negative vaccine attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 in relation to smoking status: a population survey of UK adults,"IntroductionWe examined differences in negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 specifically, by smoking status in a large sample of adults in the UK.

MethodData were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions.

ResultsRelative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsCurrent smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities.

ImplicationsThese results suggest that without intervention, smokers will be less likely than non-smokers to take up the offer of a Covid-19 vaccine when offered. Targeted policy action may be required to ensure low uptake of Covid-19 vaccination programmes does not compound health inequalities between smokers and non-smokers.",Sarah E Jackson; Elise E Paul; Jamie Brown; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248396,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248396,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
491,Enhancing the estimation of compartmental model parameters for COVID-19 data with a high level of uncertainty,"Research on predictions related to the spread of the novel coronavirus are crucial in decision-making to mitigate the disease. Computational simulations are often used as a basis for forecasting the dynamics of epidemics and, for this purpose, compartmental models have been widely used to assess the situation resulting from the spread of the disease in the population. Reliable data is essential to obtain adequate simulations. However, several political, economic, and social factors have caused inconsistencies in the reported data, which are reflected in the capacity for realistic simulations and predictions. Such uncertainties are mainly motivated by a large-scale underreporting of cases due to the reduced testing capacity in some locations. In order to mitigate the effects of noise in the data used to estimate parameters of compartmental models, we propose strategies capable of improving the ability to predict the spread of the disease. We show that the regularization of data by means of Gaussian Process Regression can reduce the variability of successive forecasts, thus improving predictive ability. We also present the advantages of adopting parameters of compartmental models that vary over time, in detriment to the usual approach with constant values.",Gustavo B Libotte; Lucas Anjos; Regina C Almeida; Sandra M C Malta; Renato S Silva,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248389,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248389,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
492,Assessing Global Covid-19 Cases Data through Compositional Data Analysis(CoDa),"BackgroundCovid-19 cases data pose an enormous challenge to any analysis. The evaluation of such a global pandemic requires matching reports that follow different procedures and even overcoming some countries censorship that restricts publications.

MethodsThis work proposes a methodology that could assist future studies. Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) is proposed as the proper approach as Covid-19 cases data is compositional in nature. Under this methodology, for each country three attributes were selected: cumulative number of deaths (D); cumulative number of recovered patients(R); present number of patients (A).

ResultsAfter the operation called closure, with c=1, a ternary diagram and Log-Ratio plots, as well as, compositional statistics are presented. Cluster analysis is then applied, splitting the countries into discrete groups.

493,Blood group A Secretors are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 cardiovascular disease complications,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, an infection capable of causing severe disease and death but which may also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic in many individuals. While several risk factors, including age, have been described, the mechanisms of this variation are poorly understood. Several studies have described associations between blood group and COVID-19 severity, while others do not. Expression of ABO glycans on secreted proteins and non-erythroid cells is controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2). Inactivating mutations result in a non-secretor phenotype which is known to protect against some viral infections. We investigated whether ABO or secretor status was associated with COVID-19 severity. Data combined from healthcare records and laboratory tests (n=275) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients hospitalised with COVID-19, confirmed higher than expected numbers of blood group A individuals compared to O (RR=1.24, CI 95% [1.05,1.47], P=0.0111). There was also a significant association between group A and COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications (RR=2.56, CI 95% [1.43,4.55], P=0.0011) which is independent of gender. Molecular analysis of phenotype revealed that group A patients who are non-secretors are significantly less likely to be hospitalised than secretors. In a larger cohort of 1000 convalescent plasma donors, among whom the majority displayed COVID-19 symptoms and only a small minority required hospitalisation, group A non-secretors were slightly over-represented. Our findings indicate that group A non-secretors are not resistant to infection by SARS-CoV-2, but they are likely to experience a less severe form of its associated disease.

494,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk perception, behaviour, and preventive measures at schools in Berlin, Germany, during the early post-lockdown phase: A cross-sectional study","BackgroundBriefly before the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Berlin, Germany, schools closed in mid-March 2020 for six weeks. Following re-opening, schools gradually resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks preceding the summer holidays.

AimDuring this phase, we conducted a situational assessment in schools among students and teachers as to infection status, symptoms, affective, behavioural, educational issues, and preventive measures.

MethodsAt twenty-four randomly selected primary and secondary schools, one class each was examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household and schooling characteristics, leisure time activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and facemask wearing were assessed.

ResultsAmong 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was SARS-CoV-2 infected (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%); 16% reported symptoms upon examination, and 48% in the preceding 14 days. Compared to before the pandemic, the proportion of leisure time spent as screen-time increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity. Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, but acceptance of adapted health behaviours was high. Governmental preventive measures were adequately implemented, with primary schools performing better than secondary schools.

ConclusionIn this phase of rare infection and low seroreactivity, individual and school-level infection prevention and control measures were largely adhered to.

This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options in some cases. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence based assay that received EUA authorization from the FDA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 27.6-45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting. These findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in high demand; often with limited resources.

496,Detection of SARS-CoV2 antigen in human saliva may be a reliable tool for large scale screening,"IntroductionSARS-CoV2, the aetiological agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, has been detected in saliva and recently implicated in several oral diseases. Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) requires medical / technical expertise. A reliable and easy to handle point-of-care (POC) test is highly desirable, especially to curb transmission. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated a commercially available POC rapid antigen test (RAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV2 antigens in the saliva of RT-PCR confirmed positive and negative patients.

MethodsThirty saliva samples of 10 saliva RT-PCR negative and 20 saliva RT-PCR positive patients were tested by RAT.

ResultsRAT was negative in 10/10 (100%) RT-PCR-negative samples; positive in 9/20 (45%) RT-PCR-positive samples; concordance was 63% (p=0.001). Patients with positive RAT had higher virus copies in their NPS samples compared to the RAT-negative patients. This difference was also statistically significant (p=0.01).

ConclusionThus, the POC RAT may be used to detect SARS-CoV2 as a reliable tool for self-testing, large-scale population screening and emergency medical/dental screening.

497,Current evidence for COVID-19 therapies: a systematic literature review,"Effective therapeutic interventions for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 are urgently needed. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019 and 14 October 2020. Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively.

In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderate-to-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term; and some included low patient numbers.

Such information is necessary to target policies and programs that prevent further excess mortality and reduce inequities.

MethodsUsing death certificate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latinos in California from March 1 through October 3, 2020. We quantified excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups defined by age, sex, place of birth, education, occupation, and combinations of these factors.

ResultsDuring the first seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded expected deaths by 10,304, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or Central America (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.63), with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in manufacturing (RR 1.62; 95% PI, 1.52, 1.72) or food-and-agriculture occupations (RR 1.50; 95% PI, 1.40, 1.61). Disparities in excess death by place of birth and education were magnified among Latinos in essential occupations.

ConclusionsForeign-birth, low formal education, and work in an essential sector put some Latinos in California at higher risk of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should reduce the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Latino immigrants and Latinos in unsafe working conditions; these may include early vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care.",Alicia R.

500,Coinfection with Respiratory Pathogens in COVID-19 in Korea,"Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in upper and lower respiratory specimens and coinfection with other respiratory pathogens in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were investigated. From the study subjects (N = 258) retrospectively enrolled when confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive, nasopharyngeal (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), and sputum specimens were restored for retesting SARS-CoV-2 and detecting respiratory pathogens. Majority of the study subjects (95.7%, N = 247) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS/OPS specimens, suggesting that the upper respiratory specimen is most valuable in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Coinfection rates in COVID-19 patients (N = 258) with respiratory pathogens were 9.7% (N = 25); 8.5% (N = 22) respiratory viruses and 1.2% (N = 3) Mycoplasma pneumoniae, an atypical bacterium. Of the respiratory virus coinfection cases (N = 22), 20 (90.9%) were co-infected with a single respiratory virus and 2 (0.8%) (metapneumovirus/adenovirus and rhinovirus/bocavirus 1/2/3/4) with two viruses. Respiratory viruses in single viral coinfection cases with SARS-CoV-2 were as follows: non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43, N = 5, 1.9%), rhinovirus (N = 4, 1.6%), metapneumovirus (N = 3, 1.2%), influenza A (N = 3, 1.2%), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (N = 3, 1.2%), and adenovirus (N = 2, 0.8%). No mixed coinfections with respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae were found. In conclusion, the diagnostic value of utilizing NPS/OPS specimen is excellent, and, as the first report in Korea, coinfection with respiratory pathogens were detected at a rate of 9.7% in patients with COVID-19.",Kyung Ho Roh; Yu Kyung Kim; Shin-Woo Kim; Eun-Rim Kang; Yong-Jin Yang; Sun-Kyung Jung; Sun-Hwa Lee; Nackmoon Sung,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248449,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248449,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
501,"History of premorbid depression is a risk factor for COVID-related mortality: Analysis of a retrospective cohort of 1,387 COVID+ patients","BackgroundThe goal of the present work was to examine risk factors for mortality in a 1,387 COVID+ patients admitted to a hospital in Suffolk County, NY.

MethodsData were collated by the hospital epidemiological service for patients admitted from 3/7/2020-9/1/2020. Time until final discharge or death was the outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate time until death among admitted patients.

FindingsIn total, 99.06% of cases had resolved leading to 1,179 discharges and 211 deaths. Length of stay was significantly longer in those who died as compared to those who did not p=0.007). Of patients who had been discharged (n=1,179), 54 were readmitted and 9 subsequently died. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that in addition to older age, male sex, and heart failure, a history of premorbid depression was a risk factor for COVI-19 mortality.

InterpretationWhile an increasing number of studies have shown effects linking cardiovascular risk factors with increased risk of mortality in COVID+ patients, this study reports that history of depression is a risk factor for COVID mortality.

502,Risk of thrombotic complications in influenza versus COVID-19 hospitalized patients,"BackgroundWhereas accumulating studies on COVID-19 patients report high incidences of thrombotic complications, large studies on clinically relevant thrombosis in patients with other respiratory tract infections are lacking. How this high risk in COVID-19 patients compares to those observed in hospitalized patients with other viral pneumonias such as influenza is unknown.

ObjectivesTo assess the incidence of venous and arterial thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients as opposed to that observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study; we used data from Statistics Netherlands (study period: 2018) on thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients. In parallel, we assessed the cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications - adjusted for competing risk of death - in patients with COVID-19 in three Dutch hospitals (February 24th - April 26th 2020).

ResultsOf the 13.217 hospitalized influenza patients, 437 (3.3%) were diagnosed with thrombotic complications, versus 66 (11%) of the 579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The 30-day cumulative incidence of any thrombotic complication in influenza was 11% (95%CI 9.4-12) versus 25% (95%CI 18-32) in COVID-19. For venous thrombotic complications (VTE) and arterial thrombotic complications alone, these numbers were respectively 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.6) and 7.5% (95%CI 6.3-8.8) in influenza versus 23% (95%CI 16-29) and 4.4% (95%CI 1.9-8.8) in COVID-19.

ConclusionsThe incidence of thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients was lower than in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This difference was mainly driven by a high risk of VTE complications in the COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. Remarkably, influenza patients were more often diagnosed with arterial thrombotic complications.

503,The COSEVAST Study: Unravelling the role of Arterial Stiffness in COVID-19 Disease severity.,"BackgroundBased on the detailed review of available research and case studies reported in reputed international journals, it can be concluded that endothelial damage (En-dotheliitis) both in small and large arteries may be an important factor of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Arterial stiffness due to Endothelial Dysfunction has been established as an independent and specific marker of various chronic cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveOur objective was to examine functional impairment of the arteries in COVID-19 disease and establish the non-invasive measurement of Arterial Stiffness as an independent marker of disease severity.

MethodsWe recorded the Arterial Stiffness of 23 Mild, 21 Moderate and 20 Severe COVID-19 patients grouped on latest NIH severity criteria. We observed Arterial Stiffness of COVID-19 patients with standard parameters like non-invasive Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave velocity (cfPWV), Age-Normalized increase in cfPWV (ANI_cfPWV).

ResultsModerate and Severe COVID-19 patients have extremely elevated arterial stiffness than Mild patients. In Mild patients, cfPWV (829.1 {+/-} 139.2 cm/s) was extremely significantly lower than both Moderate (1067 {+/-} 152.5 cm/s, P< 0.0001) and Severe (1416 {+/-} 253.9 cm/s, P < 0.0001) patients. ANI_cfPWV in Moderate and Severe patients was significantly higher than Mild patients. (Mild: 101.2 {+/-} 126.1 cm/s; Moderate: 279 {+/-} 114.4 cm/s; Severe: 580.1 {+/-} 216.4 cm/s; intergroup P <0.0001).

504,Lessons learned from Vietnam's COVID-19 response: the role of adaptive behavior change and testing in epidemic control,"BackgroundVietnam has emerged as one of the worlds leading success stories in responding to COVID-19. After prolonged zero-low transmission, a summer outbreak of unknown source at Da Nang caused the countrys first COVID-19 deaths, but was quickly suppressed. Vietnam recently reopened its borders to international travelers. Understanding the attendant risks and how to minimize them is crucial as Vietnam moves into this new phase.

MethodsWe create an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Vietnam, using regional testing data and a detailed linelist of the 1,014 COVID-19 cases, including 35 deaths, identified across Vietnam. We investigate the Da Nang outbreak, and quantify the risk of another outbreak under different assumptions about behavioral/policy responses and ongoing testing.

ResultsThe Da Nang outbreak, although rapidly contained once detected, nevertheless caused significant community transmission before it was detected; higher symptomatic testing could have mitigated this. If testing levels do not increase, the adoption of past policies in response to newly-detected cases may reduce the size of potential outbreaks but will not prevent them. Compared to a baseline symptomatic testing rate of 10%, we estimate half as many infections under a 20% testing rate, and a quarter as many with 40-50% testing rates, over the four months following border reopenings.

ConclusionsVietnams success in controlling COVID-19 is largely attributable to its rapid response to detected outbreaks, but the speed of response could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing.",Quang D Pham; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Thuong V Nguyen; Quang C Luong; Dai Q Tran; Thai Q Pham; Lan T Phan; Tan Q Dang; Duong N Tran; Hung T Do; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Romesh G Abeysuriya; Assaf P Oron; Cliff C Kerr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248454,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
505,Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution suggest a possible role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 titers,"BackgroundRecent in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pathogen and one clinical study reported fluoxetine exposure at a median dose of 20mg in patients with the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a significantly lower risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct in silico population dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (EC90) of SARS-Cov-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells.

MethodsPopulation pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for a structural one-compartment model with first-order absorption was used to simulate fluoxetine concentration-time data. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine doses (20mg/day, 40mg/day, and 60mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough level for the EC90 SARS-Cov-2 inhibitory concentration at each day throughout a 10-day treatment period. All analyses were conducted via statistical programming in R.

ResultsStandard fluoxetine antidepressant doses resulted in a range of 79% to 97% of the patient population achieving a trough target plasma concentration of 25.1 ng/ml which translates to lung-tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher (EC90 of 4.02 M). At a dose of 40mg per day, at least 85% of patients will reach the trough target EC90 concentration within 3-days.

506,Classification of the infection status of COVID-19 in 186 countries,We analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in 186 countries on the basis of the SIQR model. We first represent the time dependence of the rate of change of the number of infected individuals by a piecewise quadratic function and determine the parameters for each country by fitting the time dependence of the daily confirmed new cases of the country. We define the status of outbreak in each country by the sign and the deviation from zero of the rate and show that the infection status of each country can be completely classified into nine different states.,Takashi Odagaki; Reiji Suda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248445,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248445,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
507,Household bubbles and COVID-19 transmission: insights from percolation theory,"BackgroundIn the era of social distancing to curb the spread of COVID-19, bubbling is the combining of two or more households to create an exclusive larger group. The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved.

MethodsWe developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number.

ResultsWe find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household has a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household.

ConclusionsBubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission, however under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.",Leon Danon; Lucas Lacasa; Ellen Brooks-Pollock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248311,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248311,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True

However, a significant minority of the public are unwilling or hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine, when available. A nationally representative sample survey (N=1040) was conducted in July 2020 in New Zealand to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention. Trust in experts and general vaccine hesitancy were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention.

509,"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, risk factors for infection and associated symptoms in Geneva, Switzerland: a population-based study","BackgroundPopulation-based serological surveys provide a means for assessing the immunologic landscape of a community, without the biases related to health-seeking behaviors and testing practices typically associated with rt-PCR testing. This study assesses SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over the first epidemic wave in Canton Geneva, Switzerland, as well as biological and socio-economic risk factors for infection and symptoms associated with IgG seropositivity.

Methods and findingsBetween April 6 and June 30, 2020, former participants of a yearly representative cross-sectional survey of the 20-75-year-old population of the canton of Geneva were invited to participate in a seroprevalence study, along with household members five years and older. We collected blood and tested it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG). Questionnaires were self-administered. We estimated seroprevalence with a Bayesian model accounting for test performance and sampling design. We included 8344 participants (53.5% women, mean age 46.9 years). The population-level seroprevalence over the 12-week study period was 7.8 % (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9), accounting for sex, age and household random effects. Seroprevalence was highest among 18-49 year olds (9.5%, 95%CrI 8.1-10.9), with young children (5-9 years) and those >65 years having significantly lower seroprevalence (4.3% and 4.7-5.4% respectively). Men were more likely to be seropositive than women (relative risk 1.2, 95%CrI 1.1-1.4). Odds of seropositivity were reduced for female retirees (0.46, 95%CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (0.35, 95%CI 0.13-1.0) compared to employed individuals, and for current smokers (0.36, 95%CI 0.23-0.55) compared to never-smokers. We found no significant association between occupation, level of education, neighborhood income and the risk of being seropositive. Symptoms most strongly associated with seropositivity were anosmia/dysgeusia, loss of appetite, fever, fatigue and myalgia and/or arthralgia. Thirteen percent of seropositive participants reported no symptoms.

ConclusionsOur results confirm a low population seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first wave in Geneva, a region hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors were not associated with seropositivity in this sample. The elderly and young children were less frequently seropositive, though it is not clear how biology and behaviors shape these differences.
