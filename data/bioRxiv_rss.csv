0,Analysis of respiratory and systemic immune responses in COVID-19 reveals mechanisms of disease pathogenesis,"Immune responses to respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 originate and function in the lung, yet assessments of human immunity are often limited to blood. Here, we conducted longitudinal, high-dimensional profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19, revealing immune processes in the respiratory tract linked to disease pathogenesis. Survival from severe disease was associated with increased CD4+T cells and decreased monocyte/macrophage frequencies in the airway, but not in blood. Airway T cells and macrophages exhibited tissue-resident phenotypes and activation signatures, including high level expression and secretion of monocyte chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL3 by airway macrophages. By contrast, monocytes in blood expressed the CCL2-receptor CCR2 and aberrant CD163+ and immature phenotypes. Extensive accumulation of CD163+monocyte/macrophages within alveolar spaces in COVID-19 lung autopsies suggested recruitment from circulation. Our findings provide evidence that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by respiratory immunity, and rationale for site-specific treatment and prevention strategies.",Peter A.

1,Development and pre-clinical characterization of two therapeutic equine formulations towards SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the potential treatment of COVID-19,"In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials. The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.",Guillermo León; María Herrera; Mariángela Vargas; Mauricio Arguedas; Andrés Sánchez; Álvaro Segura; Aarón Gómez; Gabriela Solano; Eugenia Corrales-Aguilar; Kenneth Risner; Aarthi Narayanan; Charles Bailey; Mauren Villalta; Andrés Hernández; Adriana Sánchez; Daniel Cordero; Daniela Solano; Gina Durán; Eduardo Segura; Maykel Cerdas; Deibid Umaña; Edwin Moscoso; Ricardo Estrada; Jairo Gutiérrez; Marcos Méndez; Ana Cecilia Castillo; Laura Sánchez; José María Gutiérrez; Cecilia Díaz; Alberto Alape,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.343863,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.343863,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False
2,A novel viral protein translation mechanism reveals mitochondria as a target for antiviral drug development,"The ongoing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has acutely highlighted the need to identify new treatment strategies for viral infections. Here we present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria through 5' leader and 3'UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and activate the EGR1 pathway. Mitochondrial-targeted drugs such as lonidamine and polydatin significantly repress rare codon-driven gene expression and viral replication. This study identifies an unreported viral protein translation mechanism and opens up a novel avenue for developing antiviral drugs.",Zhenguo Cheng; Danhua Zhang; Jingfei Chen; Yifan Wu; Lingling Si; Zhe Zhang; Na Zhang; Zhongxian Zhang; Hong Liu; Lirong Zhang; Lijie Song; Louisa S Chard Dunmall; Jianzeng Dong; Nicholas R Lemoine; Yaohe Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.344713,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.344713,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False
3,Structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase inhibition by Favipiravir,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into an unprecedented global pandemic. Nucleoside analogues, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against the newly emerging viral diseases. Recent clinical trials of these two drugs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment revealed antiviral efficacies as well as side effects with different extents. As a pyrazine derivative, Favipiravir could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides, which may further lead to mutations in progeny RNA copies due to the non-conserved base-pairing capacity. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues which may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. These findings shed lights on the mechanism of coronavirus polymerase catalysis and provide a rational basis for developing antiviral drugs to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Qi Peng; Ruchao Peng; Bin Yuan; Min Wang; Jingru Zhao; Lifen Fu; Jianxun Qi; Yi Shi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345470,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345470,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False
4,SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through the air between ferrets over more than one meter distance,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, whereas the closely related SARS-CoV was contained rapidly in 2003. Here, a newly developed experimental set-up was used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses caused a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmitted efficiently. Serological assays confirmed all virus transmission events. Although the experiments did not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while traveling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms. Although the evidence for airborne virus transmission between humans under natural conditions is absent or weak for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets may represent a sensitive model to study interventions aimed at preventing virus transmission.",Jasmin S Kutter; Dennis de Meulder; Theo M Bestebroer; Pascal Lexmond; Ard Mulders; Ron AM Fouchier; Sander Herfst,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345363,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345363,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False
5,"On Classification and Taxonomy of Coronaviruses (Riboviria, Nidovirales, Coronaviridae) with the special focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)","Coronaviruses are highly pathogenic and therefore important human and veterinary pathogens viruses worldwide. Members of family Coronaviridae have previously been analysed phylogenetically, resulting in proposals of virus interrelationships. However, available Coronavirus phylogenies remain unrooted, based on limited sampling, and normally depend on a single method. The main subjects of this study are the taxonomy and systematics of coronaviruses and our goal is to build the first natural classification of Coronaviridae using several methods of cladistic analyses, Maximum Likelihood method, as well as rigorous taxonomic sampling, making the most accurate representation of Coronaviridae s relationships to date. Nomenclature recommendations to help effectively incorporate principles of binary nomenclature into Coronaviridae taxonomy are provided.

6,Mutational analysis and assessment of its impact on proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India,"The ongoing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 implies a corresponding accumulation of mutations. Herein the mutational status of 611 genomes from India along with their impact on proteins was ascertained. After excluding gaps and ambiguous sequences, a total of 493 variable sites (152 parsimony informative and 341 singleton) were observed. The most prevalent reference nucleotide was C (209) and substituted one was T (293). NSP3 had the highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74 sites), NSP12b (43 sites) and ORF3a (31 sites). The average number of mutations per sample for males and females was 2.56 and 2.88 respectively suggesting a higher contribution of mutations from females. Non-uniform geographical distribution of mutations implied by Odisha (30 samples, 109 mutations) and Tamil Nadu (31 samples, 40 mutations) suggests that sequences in some regions are mutating faster than others. There were 281 mutations (198 Neutral and 83 Disease) affecting amino acid sequence. NSP13 has a maximum of 14 Disease variants followed by S protein and ORF3a with 13 each. Further, constitution of Disease mutations in genomes from asymptomatic people was mere 11% but those from deceased patients was over three folds higher at 38% indicating contribution of these mutations to the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2.",Rezwanuzzaman Laskar; Safdar Ali,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345066,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345066,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False
7,"COVID-19: Variant screening, an important step towards precision epidemiology","Precision epidemiology using genomic technologies allows for a more targeted approach to COVID-19 control and treatment at individual and population level, and is the urgent need of the day. It enables identification of patients who may be at higher risk than others to COVID-19-related mortality, due to their genetic architecture, or who might respond better to a COVID-19 treatment. The COVID-19 virus, similar to SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral S protein priming. This study aspires to present a multi-omics view of how variations in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes affect COVID-19 infection and disease progression in affected individuals. It reports, for both genes, several variant and gene expression analysis findings, through (i) comparison analysis over single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that may account for the difference of COVID-19 manifestations among global sub-populations; (ii) calculating prevalence of structural variations (copy number variations (CNVs) / insertions), amongst populations; and (iii) studying expression patterns stratified by gender and age, over all human tissues. This work is a good first step to be followed by additional studies and functional assays towards informed treatment decisions and improved control of the infection rate.",Amrita Chattopadhyay; Tzu-Pin Lu; Ching-Yu Shih; Liang-Chuan Lai; Mong-Hsun Tsai; Eric Y Chuang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345140,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345140,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False
8,Diversity and genomic determinants of the microbiomes associated with COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging and highly transmissible disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the microbiomes associated with the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 diseases has clinical interest. We hypothesized that the diversity of microbiome compositions and their genomic features are associated with different pathological conditions of these human respiratory tract diseases (COVID-19 and non-COVID; URTI and COPD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 21 whole metagenome sequences (WMS) including eleven COVID-19 (BD = 6 and China = 5), six COPD (UK = 6) and four URTI (USA = 4) samples to unravel the diversity of microbiomes, their genomic features and relevant metabolic functions. The WMS data mapped to 534 bacterial, 60 archaeal and 61 viral genomes with distinct variation in the microbiome composition across the samples (COVID-19>COPD>URTI). Notably, 94.57%, 80.0% and 24.59% bacterial, archaeal and viral genera shared between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples, respectively, however, the COVID-19 related samples had sole association with 16 viral genera other than SARS-CoV-2. Strain-level virome profiling revealed 660 and 729 strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID sequence data, respectively and of them 34.50% strains shared between the conditions. Functional annotation of metagenomics sequences of thevCOVID-19 and non-COVID groups identified the association of several biochemical pathways related to basic metabolism (amino acid and energy), ABC transporters, membrane transport, replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems, virulence, disease and defense, adhesion, regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and primary immunodeficiency. We also detected 30 functional gene groups/classes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (RATC) in both COVID-19 and non-COVID microbiomes. Furthermore, a predominant higher abundance of cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance (CZCR) and multidrug resistance to efflux pumps (MREP) genes were detected in COVID-19 metagenome. The profiles of microbiome diversity and associated microbial genomic features found in both COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI) samples might be helpful for developing the microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases. However, future studies might be carried out to explore the microbiome dynamics and the cross-talk between host and microbiomes employing larger volume of samples from different ethnic groups and geoclimatic conditions.",M.

9,An engineered decoy receptor for SARS-CoV-2 broadly binds protein S sequence variants,"The spike S of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 on the host cell membrane to initiate entry. Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, due to close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find an engineered decoy receptor, sACE22.v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.",Kui K Chan; Timothy JC Tan; Krishna K Narayanan; Erik Procko,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.344622,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.344622,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False
10,"Single cell resolution of SARS-CoV-2 tropism, antiviral responses, and susceptibility to therapies in primary human airway epithelium","The human airway epithelium is the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used flow cytometry and single cell RNA-Sequencing to understand how the heterogeneity of this diverse cell population contributes to elements of viral tropism and pathogenesis, antiviral immunity, and treatment response to remdesivir. We found that, while a variety of cell types are susceptible to infection, ciliated cells are a predominant cell target for SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir treatment effectively inhibited viral replication across cell types, and blunted hyperinflammatory responses. We also found that heavily infected epithelial cells demonstrate impaired IFN signaling and express abundant IL-6, a potential mediator of COVID-19 pathogenesis.",Jessica K. Fiege; Joshua M.

11,COVID-19 In a Rural Health System in New York - Case Series and an Approach to Management,"Background: Many rural hospitals and health systems in the U.S. lack sufficient resources to treat COVID-19. We developed a system for managing inpatient COVID-19 hospital admissions in St. Lawrence County, an underserved rural county which is the largest county in New York State. Methods: We used a hub and spoke system to route COVID-19 patients in the St. Lawrence Health System to its flagship hospital. We assembled a small clinical team to manage admitted COVID-19 patients and to stay abreast of a quickly changing body of literature and standard of care. We subsequently completed a review of clinical data for patients who were treated by our inpatient COVID-19 treatment team between March 20 and May 22, 2020. Results: Twenty COVID-19 patients were identified. Sixteen patients (80%) met NIH criteria for severe or critical disease. One patient died. No patients were transferred to other hospitals. Conclusions: During the first two months of the pandemic, we were able to manage hospitalized COVID-19 patients in our rural community.

12,"Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge","Background The medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood. Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls. Interpretation A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.",Betty Raman; Mark Philip Cassar; Elizabeth M Tunnicliffe; Nicola Filippini; Ludovica Griffanti; Fidel Alfaro-Almagro; Thomas Okell; Fintan Sheerin; Cheng Xie; Masliza Mahmod; Ferenc E Mózes; Adam J Lewandowski; Eric O Ohuma; David Holdsworth; Hanan Lamlum; Myles J Woodman; Catherine Krasopoulos; Rebecca Mills; Flora A Kennedy McConnel; Chaoyue Wang; Christoph Arthofer; Frederik J Lange; Jesper Andersson; Mark Jenkinson; Charalambos Antoniades; Keith M Channon; Mayooran Shanmuganathan; Vanessa M Ferreira; Stefan K Piechnik; Paul Klenerman; Christopher Brightling; Nick P Talbot; Nayia Petousi; Najib M Rahman; Ling-Pei Ho; Kate Saunders; John R Geddes; Paul Harrison; Kyle Pattinson; Matthew J Rowland; Brian Angus; Fergus Gleeson; Michael Pavlides; Ivan Koychev; Karla L Miller; Clare Mackay; Peter Jezzard; Stephen M Smith; Stefan Neubauer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20205054,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20205054,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
13,"HIV testing by public health centers and municipalities, and new HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","Background: During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical resources were primarily allocated to COVID-19, which might have reduced facility capacity for HIV testing. Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and its consequences in Japan. Methods: We analysed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations that public health centers received, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the same analysis for two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese. Findings: The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. The number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis numerically decreased (166 vs. 217), although the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trend for the MSM and non-Japanese groups. Interpretation: The current HIV testing system including public health centers misses more HIV cases at the early phase of the infection during the pandemic. Given that the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the pandemic is still uncertain, continuously monitoring the situation as well as securing sufficient test resources using self-test is essential.",Keisuke Ejima; Yoshiki Koizumi; Nao Yamamoto; Molly Rosenberg; Christina Ludema; Ana I Bento; Daisuke Yoneoka; Seiichi Ichikawa; Daisuke Mizushima; Shingo Iwami,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213959,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213959,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True

We aimed to investigate whether white blood cell traits have potential causal effects on severe COVID-19 using Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: To evaluate the causal associations between various white blood cell traits and severe COVID-19, we conducted a two-sample MR analysis with summary statistics from recent large genome-wide association studies. Results: Our MR results indicated potential causal associations of white blood cell count, myeloid white blood cell count, and granulocyte count with severe COVID-19, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.98), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.70-0.94), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.99), respectively. Increasing eosinophil percentage of white blood cells was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.45).

17,Tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the wastewater treatment process,"The municipal sewage carries the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), shed by COVID-19 patients, to wastewater treatment plants. Proper wastewater treatment can provide an important barrier for preventing uncontrolled discharged of the virus into the environment. However, the role of the different wastewater treatment stages in reducing virus concentrations was, thus far, unknown. In this work, we quantified SARS-CoV-RNA in the raw sewage and along the main stages of the wastewater process from two different plants in Israel during this COVID-19 outbreak. We found that ca. 2 Log removal could be attained after primary and secondary treatment. Despite this removal, significant concentrations of SARS-CoV-RNA (>100 copies per mL) could still be detected in the treated wastewater.

Our results highlight the need to protect wastewater treatment plants operators, as well as populations living near areas of wastewater discharge, from the risk of infection.

18,Role of Professionalism in the Policy Response to COVID-19: Does a Public Health or Medical Background Help?,"Less than 5 percent of Chinese cities had top-ranked officials with public health or medical backgrounds (PHMBGs). Does professionalism improve their response to a public crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic? Collecting resumes of government and Party officials in almost all prefectural Chinese cities, and matching with other data sources, including weather conditions, city characteristics, COVID-19-related policies, and health outcomes, we demonstrate that cities 15 whose top officials had PHMBGs witnessed significantly lower infection rates, and often lower death rates, than cities whose top officials lacked such backgrounds. Mechanism testing suggests that the effects were at least partially explained by more rapid lockdown or community closure. Our findings offer insights into better preparation for future epidemics via improving leadership team composition, particularly recruiting major officials with PHMBGs.",Xun Li; Weizheng Lai; Qianqian Wan; Xi Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213934,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213934,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
19,Melatonin is significantly associated with survival of intubated COVID-19 patients,"Background <br> Respiratory distress requiring intubation is the most serious complication associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <br> Methods In this retrospective study, we used survival analysis to determine whether or not mortality following intubation was associated with hormone exposure in patients treated at New York Presbyterian/ Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Here, we report the overall hazards ratio for each hormone for exposure before and after intubation for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. <br> Results Among the 189,987 patients, we identified 948 intubation periods across 791 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or infected with SARS-CoV2 and 3,497 intubation periods across 2,981 patients who were not. Melatonin exposure after intubation was statistically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.131, 95% CI: 7.76E-02 - 0.223, p-value = 8.19E-14) and non-COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.278, 95% CI: 0.142 - 0.542, p-value = 1.72E-04) intubated patients. Additionally, melatonin exposure after intubation was statically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 patients (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.127, 95% CI: 6.01E-02 - 0.269, p-value = 7.15E-08). <br> Conclusions Melatonin exposure after intubation is significantly associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, melatonin exposure after intubation is significantly associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. While our models account for many covariates, including clinical history and demographics, it is impossible to rule out confounding or collider biases within our population.

20,Modelling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a UK university setting,"Background: The higher education system in the United Kingdom comprises a large student population. Around 40% of school leavers attend university and individual universities generally host thousands of students each academic year. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing together these student communities presents questions regarding the strength of interventions required to control transmission. Prior modelling analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within universities has usually adopted a compartmental modelling approach, whose projections suggest an almost inevitable likelihood of outbreaks. Methods: We constructed a network-based model to capture the interactions of a student population in different settings (housing, social and study). For a representative campus-based university, we ran a susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered type epidemic process, parameterised according to available estimates for SARS-CoV-2. Over the course of a single academic term, we investigated the impact on infection control of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation, test and trace measures, the additional use of room isolation as an intervention and supplementary mass testing. Results: Incorporating uncertainty in the fraction of cases that are asymptomatic and their associated infectivity, in the absence of interventions our model estimated that 16% (2% - 38%) of the student population could be infected during the autumn term. In contrast, with full adherence to isolation measures and engagement with test-and-trace, predictions of the cumulative infection count were lower, 1.4% (0.4% - 5%). Irrespective of the adherence to isolation measures, on average a higher proportion of students resident on-campus became infected compared with students resident off-campus. Widespread adherence of interventions led to reductions in the average fraction of time those individuals adhering to measures were expected to be isolated, with room isolation as an additional intervention generating minimal benefits. The model found that a one-off instance of mass testing would not drastically reduce the term-long case load or end-of-term prevalence, but regular weekly or fortnightly testing could reduce both measures by more than 50% (compared to having no mass testing). Conclusions: Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 may readily transmit amongst a student population within a university setting if there is limited adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions and there are delays present in receiving test results. Following isolation guidance and effective contact tracing both curbed transmission and reduced the expected time an adhering student would spend in isolation. Additionally, widespread adherence throughout the term suppresses the amount of unwitting asymptomatic transmission to family and community members in the students' domicile regions at the end of term.",Edward M Hill; Benjamin D Atkins; Matt J Keeling; Michael Tildesley; Louise Dyson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20208454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20208454,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
21,Predictors of severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 reinfection,"Background: There is a major concern regarding the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who recovered to first-time illness. Objective: To evaluate factors predicting severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR) SARS-COV-2 (severe acute coronavirus-2) reinfection. Method: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico and data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-COV-2 infection. Results: The risk of severe disease was 14.7% and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38] and previous severe laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating disease outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection and factors associated with illness severity was characterized. Our results may contribute to the current knowledge of SARS-COV-2 pathogenicity and to identify populations at increased risk of a poorer outcome after reinfection.",Efren Murillo-Zamora; Oliver Mendoza-Cano; Ivan Delgado-Enciso; CARLOS M HERNANDEZ-SUAREZ,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212720,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212720,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
22,Aging and COVID-19 mortality: A demographic perspective,"Demographers were among the first to emphasize the importance of age in explaining the spread and impact on mortality of COVID-19. Yet, the relationship between age and COVID-19 is not fully understood. This study aims to answer the following questions: Do COVID-19 deaths follow the Gompertz force of mortality? How does the relationship between age and COVID-19 mortality compare with other major causes of death? Does this relationship vary between countries? Using US vital Statistics, COVID-19 mortality doubling time is compared with 68 major cause of death categories. COVID-19 fatality is similarly compared across 33 countries using COVerAGE-DB, a harmonized dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Several findings are supported by the evidence. First, COVID-19 mortality increasing exponentially with age at a rate near the median of aging-related causes of death, as well as pneumonia and influenza. Second, COVID-19 mortality levels in the US are currently 4 to 8 times higher than pneumonia and influenza across the adult age range. Third, the relationship between COVID-19 fatality and age varies considerably across high-income countries. Fourth, these regularities can be utilized for indirect estimation of COVID-19 deaths by age. In conclusion, the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and age resembles the population rate of aging. Between-country variation in the Gompertz slope of COVID-19 fatality may point to differences in underlying population health, standards of clinical care, and data quality.",Isaac Sasson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213454,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
23,National Routine Adult Immunization Programs among World Health Organization Member States: An Assessment of Health Systems to Deploy Future SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines,"Introduction: As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disproportionately affects older adults, future pandemic vaccine response will rely on existing adult immunization infrastructures. Methods: We evaluated the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization for country reports on adult immunization programs. We described countries with programs and used multivariable regression to identify independent factors associated with having them. Results: Of 194 WHO Member States, 120 (62%) reported having any adult vaccination program. The Americas and Europe had the most adult immunization programs, most commonly Hepatitis B and influenza vaccines (>45% and >90% of countries). Africa and South-East Asia had the fewest adult immunization programs, with <11% of countries reporting any adult immunization programs for influenza or hepatitis vaccines, and none for pneumococcal vaccines. In bivariate analyses, high- or upper-middle income, introduction of new or underused vaccines, having achieved pediatric vaccine coverage goals, and meeting National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups basic functional indicators were significantly associated (p<0.001) with having any adult immunization programs. In multivariable analyses, the factor most strongly associated with adult immunization programs was country income, with high- or upper-middle income countries significantly more likely to report having a program (aOR 19.3, 95% CI 6.5, 57.7). Discussion: That 38% of countries lack functional platforms for adult immunization has major implications for future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine deployment. Systems for vaccine storage and handling, delivery, and waste management for adult immunization do not exist in much of the world. Developing countries should strengthen immunization programs to reach adults with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines when they become available.",Sarah R Williams; Amanda J Driscoll; Hanna M LeBuhn; Wilbur H Chen; Kathleen M Neuzil; Justin R Ortiz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213967,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213967,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True

Acute neurologic symptoms including encephalitis, acute myopathic quadriplegia, strokes and seizures have been reported in COVID-19.1 Anecdotally, even survivors without acute neurologic conditions have reported long-term neurologic symptoms months after their illness. These reports have called for the importance of studying long-term neurologic outcomes, also referred as the 'Long-Haul COVID'.2 During previous epidemics, including SARS and MERS, both short- and long-term neurological symptoms were reported3 but the chronic neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are unknown.

Here, we demonstrate the utility of volumetric three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging using tissue optical clearing and light sheet microscopy to investigate host-pathogen interactions of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets at a mesoscopic scale. The superior spatial context of large, intact samples (> 150 mm3) allowed detailed quantification of interrelated parameters like focus-to-focus distance or SARS-CoV-2-infected area, facilitating an in-depth description of SARS-CoV-2 infection foci. Accordingly, we could confirm a preferential infection of the ferret upper respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 and emphasize a distinct focal infection pattern in nasal turbinates.

Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived alveolar type-II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19. Infected ALO-monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2[-&gt;]AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both.

27,Molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by temperature,"Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be inactivated by effect of heat, even though, little is known about the molecular changes induced by the temperature. Here, we unravel the basics of such inactivation mechanism over the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by executing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Both the closed down and open up states, which determine the accessibility to the receptor binding domain, were considered. Results suggest that the spike undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bond network while salt bridges are mainly preserved. Reorganization in the hydrogen bonds structure produces conformational variations in the receptor binding subunit and explain the thermal inactivation of the virus. Conversely, the macrostructure of the spike is preserved at high temperature because of the retained salt bridges. The proposed mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Didac Marti; Joan Torras; Oscar Bertran; Pau Turon; Carlos Aleman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.343459,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.343459,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,False
28,"Structure, Dynamics, Receptor Binding, and Antibody Binding of Fully-glycosylated Full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in a Viral Membrane","The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates host cell entry by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and is considered the major target for drug and vaccine development. We previously built fully-glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple s-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of S protein, and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of RBD, and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of a commonly-used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibody.

29,Ongoing Adaptive Evolution and Globalization of Sars-Cov-2,"Unprecedented sequencing efforts have, as of October 2020, produced over 100,000 genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is paramount to control the pandemic. Although this extensive data availability quickly facilitated the development of vaccine candidates1, major challenges in the analysis of this enormous dataset persist, limiting the ability of public health officials to translate science into policy. Having evolved over a short period of time, the SARS-CoV-2 isolates show low diversity, necessitating analysis of trees built from genome-scale data. Here we provide a complete ancestral genome reconstruction for SARS-CoV-2 leveraging Fitch Traceback2. We show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection. However, a small set of sites, including the extensively studied spike 6143, harbor mutations which recurred on multiple, independent occasions, indicative of positive selection. These mutations form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions. The phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 7 major clades which show distinct global and temporal dynamics.

However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19. Objectives: To find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion. Results: The survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment for about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients.

32,Recovery of monocyte exhaustion is associated with resolution of lung injury in COVID-19 convalescence.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection resulting in the clinical syndrome COVID-19 is associated with an exaggerated immune response and monocyte infiltrates in the lungs and other peripheral tissues. It is now increasingly recognised that chronic morbidity persists in some patients. We recently demonstrated profound alterations of monocytes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. It is currently unclear whether these abnormalities resolve or progress following patient discharge. We show here that blood monocytes in convalescent patients at their 12 week follow up, have a greater propensity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6, which was consistently higher in patients with resolution of lung injury as indicated by a normal chest X-ray and no shortness of breath (a key symptom of lung injury). Furthermore, monocytes from convalescent patients also displayed enhanced levels of molecules involved in leucocyte migration, including chemokine receptor CXCR6, adhesion molecule CD31/PECAM and integrins VLA-4 and LFA-1. Expression of migration molecules on monocytes was also consistently higher in convalescent patients with a normal chest X-ray. These data suggest persistent changes in innate immune function following recovery from COVID-19 and indicate that immune modulating therapies targeting monocytes and leucocyte migration may be useful in recovering COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms.",Nicholas A Scott; Sean Blandin Knight; Laurence Pearmain; Oliver Brand; David J Morgan; Chris Jagger; Saba Khan; Pamela Hackney; Lara Smith; Madhvi Menon; Joanne Konkel; Halima A Shuwa; Miriam Franklin; Verena Kaestele; Sarah Harbach; Seema Brij; Andrew Ustianowski; Alison Uriel; Gabriella Lindergard; Nawar Diar Bakerly; Paul Dark; Alexander Mathioudakis; Kathryn Gray; Graham Lord; Timothy Felton; Chris Brightling; Ling-Pei Ho; - NIHR Respiratory TRC; - CIRCO; Karen Piper Hanley; Angela Simpson; John R Grainger; Tracy Hussell; Elizabeth R Mann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20207449,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20207449,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
33,sMAdCAM:IL-6 (sMIL Index): A novel signature associated with COVID-19 disease progression and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"IMPORTANCE: Recent studies positing the gut as a sanctuary site for viral persistence in SARS-CoV-2 infection highlight the importance of assimilating profiles of systemic as well as gut inflammatory mediators to understand the pathology of COVID-19. Also, the role of these markers in governing virus specific immunity following infection remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of systemic and gut inflammatory markers in disease progression and development of anti-viral humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (n=58) of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals included a group of in-patients (n=36) at various stages of disease progression together with convalescent individuals (n=22) recruited between April and June 2020 (peak of the epidemic) from a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 11 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out, resulting in a total of 47 in-patient samples. EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based testing of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the measurement of inflammatory markers including Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and levels of soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) in plasma. Anti-viral humoral response was measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (IgG). Also antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Secondary outcomes were correlation of the inflammatory signature with clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration and co-morbidities. RESULTS: Twenty eight of 36 (78%) in-patients and 19 of 22 (86%) convalescents were males. Out of 47 in-patient samples, 22 (46%), 11 (23%) and 14 (30%) were IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM- respectively. Of 22 convalescent samples, 3 (14%), 1 (4%) and 17 (77%) were respectively IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-. Two out of 22 (9%) convalescents showed high IL-6 levels (>100pg/ml) and 4 (18%) had high TNF levels (>30pg/ml). However, the convalescents (n =22) had significantly lower levels of IL-6 [Median=27.48 (IQR=23.54-39.92)] compared to followed up in-patients (n = 11) at day 0 [Median=111(IQR=68-129.7), p =0.0002] and higher levels of sMAdCAM [Median=1940 (1711-2174) pg/ml] compared to these individuals at day 0 [Median=1701 (IQR=1532-1836) pg/ml; p=0.032] and day 7 [Median=1534 (IQR=1236-1654) pg/ml; p=0.0007]. Further, IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients inversely correlated with one another (r =-0.374, p = 0.009, CI = 95%). When expressed as a novel integrated marker, sMIL (sMAdCAM/IL-6 ratio) index, these levels were incrementally and significantly higher across various disease states with convalescents exhibiting the highest values [Median= 64.74 (IQR=47.33-85.58)]. Also, the sMIL index was significantly higher in convalescents (with class-switched responses) compared to IgG+/IgM+ individuals at early stages of infection [Median=28.65 (IQR=13.63-96.26), p = 0.034]. Real-time measurement by SPR of plasma antibody binding to viral nucleocapsid (NC), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) revealed waxing and waning of plasma antibody responses to all 3 targets. Importantly, sMAdCAM levels as well as sMIL index (fold change) correlated with peak association rates of RBD-binding (r = 0.462, p = 0.03, CI = 95%) and fold change in binding to S (r = 0.68, p = 0.050, CI = 95%) respectively.

34,SARS-CoV-2 S protein ACE2 interaction reveals novel allosteric targets,"The Spike (S) protein is the main handle for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells through surface ACE2 receptors. How ACE2 binding activates proteolysis of S protein is unknown. Here, we have mapped the S:ACE2 interface and uncovered long-range allosteric propagation of ACE2 binding to sites critical for viral host entry. Unexpectedly, ACE2 binding enhances dynamics at a distal S1/S2 cleavage site and flanking protease docking site ~27 [A] away while dampening dynamics of the stalk hinge (central helix and heptad repeat) regions ~ 130 [A] away. This highlights that the stalk and proteolysis sites of the S protein are dynamic hotspots in the pre-fusion state. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for S:ACE2 complex formation, critical for proteolytic processing and viral-host membrane fusion and highlight protease docking sites flanking the S1/S2 cleavage site, fusion peptide and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) as allosterically exposed cryptic hotspots for potential therapeutic development.

35,Novel Machine-Learned Approach for COVID-19 Resource Allocation: A Tool for EvaluatingCommunity Susceptibility,"Despite worldwide efforts to develop an effective COVID vaccine, it is quite evident that initial supplies will be limited. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that will ensure that the COVID vaccine is allocated to the people who are at major risk until there is a sufficient global supply. Herein, I developed a machine-learning tool that could be applied to assess the risk in communities based on social, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. As a proof of concept, I modeled COVID risk in the Massachusetts communities using 29 risk factors, including the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions like COPD and social factors such as racial composition. Of the 29 factors, 14 were found to be significant (p < 0.1) indicators: poverty, food insecurity, lack of high school education, lack of health insurance coverage, premature mortality, population, population density, recent population growth, Asian percentage, high-occupancy housing, and preexisting prevalence of cancer, COPD, overweightness, and heart attacks. The machine-learning approach finds the 9 highest risk communities in the state of Massachusetts: Lynn, Brockton, Revere, Randolph, Lowell, New Bedford, Everett, Waltham, and Fitchburg. The 5 most at-risk counties are Suffolk, Middlesex, Bristol, Norfolk, and Plymouth. With appropriate data, the tool could evaluate risk in other communities, or even enumerate individual patient susceptibility.

36,Analysis of Collective Response Reveals that COVID-19-Related Activities Start From the End of 2019 in Mainland China,"While the COVID-19 outbreak is making an impact at a global scale, the collective response to the pandemic becomes the key to analyzing past situations, evaluating current measures, and formulating future predictions. In this paper, we analyze the public reactions to the pandemic using search engine data and mobility data from Baidu Search and Baidu Maps respectively, where we particularly pay attentions to the early stage of pandemics and find early signals from the collective response to COVID-19. First, we correlate the number of confirmed cases per day to daily search queries of a large number of keywords through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA), where the keywords top in the most critical days are believed the most relevant to the pandemic. We then categorize the ranking lists of keywords according to the specific regions of the search, such as Wuhan, Mainland China, the USA, and the whole world. Through the analysis on search, we succeed in identifying COVID-19 related collective response would not be earlier than the end of 2019 in Mainland China. Finally, we confirm this observation again using human mobility data, where we specifically compare the massive mobility traces, including the real-time population densities inside key hospitals and inter-city travels departing from/arriving in Wuhan, from 2018 to 2020.

37,Understanding the value of clinical symptoms of COVID-19. A logistic regression model,"Background The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is responsible for the current pandemic outbreak worldwide. However, there is limited information regarding the set of specific symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the main symptoms associated with COVID-19 to aid in the clinical diagnosis for the rapid identification of cases. Methods and findings A cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers. A total of 67318 individuals were included in this study, where 12% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population was divided in two age groups, a group aged 0 to 55 years-old (<56 group), (median = 32, n=48748) and another group aged 56 to 103 years-old ([&ge;]56 group) (median =72, n=18570). A cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers.Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that out of a total of 23 symptoms, only five were found to have a positive association with COVID-19: anosmia (odds ratio [OR] 10.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.20-13.10, <56 group; OR 6.09 CI 3.05-12.20, [&ge;]56 group), dysgeusia (OR 3.67, CI 2.7-4.9, <56 group; OR 3.53 CI 1.52-8.18, [&ge;]56 group), low grade fever (37.5-37.9 {degrees}C) (OR 1.61, CI 1.20-2.05, <56 group; OR 1.80 CI 1.07-3.06, [&ge;]56 group), cough (OR 1.20, CI 1.05-1.38, <56 group; OR 1.37 CI 1.04-1.80, [&ge;]56 group) and headache only in <56 group (OR 1.71, CI 1.48-1.99). In turn, at the time of presentation, the symptoms associated with respiratory problems: chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, respiratory failure and use of accessory muscles for breathing, had a negative association with COVID-19 (OR <1) or did not present statistical relevance (OR = 1). With the intention of helping the clinical diagnosis, we designed a model to be able to identify possible cases of COVID-19. This model included 16 symptoms, the age and sex of the individuals, and was able to detect 80% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 with a specificity of 46%. Conclusions The analysis of symptoms opens the opportunity for a guidance and improved symptoms based definition of suspected cases of COVID-19, where multiple factors (age, sex, symptoms and interaction between symptoms) are considered.

38,Title: COVID-19 and frontline health workers in West Africa: a scoping review,"Introduction The novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global health threat since its emergence. Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic well-being of frontline health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. Materials and methods Literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question. Results Of the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility. Conclusion Being the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa, the study has illustrated the urgent need for West African governments to enact laws/rules that would compel all frontline health workers to adhere to all the COVID-19 protocols at the workplace. To end intermittent shortage or issue of inadequate PPEs, governments ought to liaise with local industries by empowering them, providing financial support and creating a conducive atmosphere for them to produce cost effective PPEs using available local resources.",Kingsley K.A.

39,On Modeling of COVID-19 for the Indian Subcontinent using Polynomial and Supervised Learning Regression,"COVID-19, a recently declared pandemic by WHO has taken the world by storm causing catastrophic damage to human life. The novel cornonavirus disease was first incepted in the Wuhan city of China on 31st December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Since the devastating phenomenon is essentially a time-series representation, accurate modeling may benefit in identifying the root cause and accelerate the diagnosis. In the current analysis, COVID-19 modeling is done for the Indian subcontinent based on the data collected for the total cases confirmed, daily recovered, daily deaths, total recovered and total deaths. The data is treated with total confirmed cases as the target variable and rest as feature variables. It is observed that Support vector regressions yields accurate results followed by Polynomial regression. Random forest regression results in overfitting followed by poor Bayesian regression due to highly correlated feature variables. Further, in order to examine the effect of neighbouring countries, Pearson correlation matrix is computed to identify geographic cause and effect.",Dishita Neve; Honey Patel; Harsh S Dhiman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212563,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212563,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
40,"CoViD-19, learning from the past: A wavelet and cross-correlation analysis of the epidemic dynamics looking to emergency calls and Twitter trends in Italian Lombardy region","The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Italy was detected on February the 20th in Lombardy region. Since that date, Lombardy has been the most affected Italian region by the epidemic, and its healthcare system underwent a severe crisis during the outbreak. From a public health point of view, therefore, it is fundamental to provide healthcare services with tools that can reveal a possible new epidemic burden with a certain time anticipation, which is the main aim of the present study. Moreover, the sequence of law decrees to face the epidemic and the large amount of news generated in the population feelings of anxiety and suspicion. Considering this whole complex context, it is easily understandable how people overcrowded social media with messages dealing with the pandemic, and emergency numbers were overwhelmed by the calls. Thus, in order to find potential predictors of a possible second epidemic wave, we analyzed data both from Twitter and from emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Since our principal goal is to forecast a possible new ascending phase of the epidemic, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast a new burden. Since we analyzed aggregated regional data, and taking into account also the huge geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic spread, a future perspective would be to conduct the same analysis on a more local basis.",Bruno Alessandro Rivieccio; Alessandra Micheletti; Manuel Maffeo; Matteo Zignani; Alessandro Comunian; Federica Nicolussi; Silvia Salini; Giancarlo Manzi; Francesco Auxilia; Mauro Giudici; Giovanni Naldi; Sabrina Gaito; Silvana Castaldi; Elia Biganzoli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212415,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212415,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
41,Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed. Methods: An ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions. Findings: Between April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms. There was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p<0.05). Interpretation: In a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.",Andrea Dennis; Malgorzata Wamil; Sandeep Kapur; Johann Alberts; Andrew Badley; Gustav Anton Decker; Stacey A Rizza; Rajarshi Banerjee; Amitava Banerjee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212555,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212555,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
42,A betacoronavirus multiplex microsphere immunoassay detects early SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and controls for pre-existing seasonal human coronavirus antibody cross-reactivity,"With growing concern of persistent or multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays remain critical for community and hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Here, we describe the development and application of a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA) for COVD-19 antibody studies, utilizing serum samples from non-human primate SARS-CoV-2 infection models, an archived human sera bank and subjects enrolled at five U.S. military hospitals. The MMIA incorporates prefusion stabilized spike glycoprotein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the seasonal human coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, into a multiplexing system that enables simultaneous measurement of off-target pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We report the sensitivity and specificity performances for this assay strategy at 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity for subject samples collected as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms. In archival sera collected prior to 2019 and serum samples from subjects PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2, we detected seroprevalence of 72% and 98% for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-0C43, respectively. Requiring only 1.25 uL of sera, this approach permitted the simultaneous identification of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, further demonstrating the presence of conserved epitopes in the spike glycoprotein of zoonotic betacoronaviruses. Application of this serology assay in observational studies with serum samples collected from subjects before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection will permit an investigation of the influences of HCoV-induced antibodies on COVID-19 clinical outcomes.",Eric D.

43,The effect of influenza vaccination on trained immunity: impact on COVID-19,"Every year, influenza causes 290.000 to 650.000 deaths worldwide and vaccination is encouraged to prevent infection in high-risk individuals. Interestingly, cross-protective effects of vaccination against heterologous infections have been reported, and long-term boosting of innate immunity (also termed trained immunity) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Several epidemiological studies also suggested cross-protection between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 during the current pandemic. However, the mechanism behind such an effect is unknown. Using an established in-vitro model of trained immunity, we demonstrate that the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine used in the Netherlands in the 2019-2020 influenza season can induce a trained immunity response, including an improvement of cytokine responses after stimulation of human immune cells with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was less common among Dutch hospital employees who had received influenza vaccination during the 2019/2020 winter season (RR = 0,61 (95% CI, 0.4585 - 0.8195, P = 0.001). In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against COVID-19. These data, coupled with similar recent independent reports, argue for a beneficial effect of influenza vaccination against influenza as well as COVID-19, and suggests its effective deployment in the 2020-2021 influenza season to protect against both infections.",Priya A.

44,Early Prediction of COVID-19 Severity Using Extracellular Vesicles and Extracellular RNAs,"The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death. But the predictive biomarkers for characterizing the variability are still lacking. Since emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are functionally involved in a number of pathological processes, we hypothesize that these extracellular components may be key determinants and/or predictors of COVID-19 severity. To test our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms at the time of their admission. After standard therapy without corticosteroids, 9 of the 31 patients developed severe COVID-19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID-19 severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and liver damage-related exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. Among these markers, EV COPB2 has the best predictive value for severe deterioration of COVID-19 patients in this cohort. This type of information concerning functional extracellular component profiles could have great value for patient stratification and for making early clinical decisions about strategies for COVID-19 therapy.",Yu Fujita; Tokio Hoshina; Juntaro Matsuzaki; Tsukasa Kadota; Shota Fujimoto; Hironori Kawamoto; Naoaki Watanabe; Kenji Sawaki; Yohei Sakamoto; Makiko Miyajima; Kwangyole Lee; Kazuhiko Nakaharai; Tetsuya Horino; Ryo Nakagawa; Jun Araya; Mitsuru Miyato; Masaki Yoshida; Kazuyoshi Kuwano; Takahiro Ochiya,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212340,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212340,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
45,How to remove the testing bias in CoV-2 statistics,"BACKGROUND. Public health measures and private behaviour are based on reported numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Some argue that testing influences the confirmed number of infections. OBJECTIVES/METHODS. Do time series on reported infections and the number of tests allow one to draw conclusions about actual infection numbers? A SIR model is presented where the true numbers of susceptible, infectious and removed individuals are unobserved. Testing is also modelled. RESULTS. Official confirmed infection numbers are likely to be biased and cannot be compared over time. The bias occurs because of different reasons for testing (e.g. by symptoms, representative or testing travellers). The paper illustrates the bias and works out the effect of the number of tests on the number of reported cases. The paper also shows that the positive rate (the ratio of positive tests to the total number of tests) is uninformative in the presence of non-representative testing. CONCLUSIONS. A severity index for epidemics is proposed that is comparable over time. This index is based on Covid-19 cases and can be obtained if the reason for testing is known.",Klaus Waelde,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212431,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212431,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True

A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.",Ursula Rescher; Sebastian Schloer; Linda Brunotte; Angeles Mecate-Zambrano; Shuyu Zheng; Jing Tang; Stephan Ludwig,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
47,Peptide vaccine candidate mimics the heterogeneity of natural SARS-CoV-2 immunity in convalescent humans and induces broad T cell responses in mice models,"We developed a global peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that addresses the dual challenges of heterogeneity in the immune responses of different individuals and potential heterogeneity of the infecting virus. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 is a polypeptide vaccine containing nine 30-mer peptides derived from all four major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents blood investigated, 1-5 months after symptom onset. The PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific T cell repertoire used for recovery from COVID-19 was extremely diverse: donors had an average of seven different peptide-specific T cells, against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins; 87% of donors had multiple targets against at least three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 53% against all four. In addition, PEPIs determined based on the complete HLA class I genotype of the convalescent donors were validated, with 84% accuracy, to predict PEPI-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured for the individuals.

48,Abnormal Antibodies to Self-Carbohydrates in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients,"SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly virus that is causing the global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our immune system plays a critical role in preventing, clearing, and treating the virus, but aberrant immune responses can contribute to deleterious symptoms and mortality. Many aspects of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated, but little is known about immune responses to carbohydrates. Since the surface of the virus is heavily glycosylated, pre-existing antibodies to glycans could potentially recognize the virus and influence disease progression. Furthermore, antibody responses to carbohydrates could be induced, affecting disease severity and clinical outcome. In this study, we used a carbohydrate antigen microarray with over 800 individual components to profile serum anti-glycan antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy control subjects. In COVID-19 patients, we observed abnormally high IgG and IgM antibodies to numerous self-glycans, including gangliosides, N-linked glycans, LacNAc-containing glycans, blood group H, and sialyl Lewis X. Some of these anti-glycan antibodies are known to play roles in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, which may help explain some of the unusual and prolonged symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies to self-glycans has important implications for using convalescent serum to treat patients, developing safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and understanding the risks of infection. In addition, this study provides new insight into the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates the importance of including host and viral carbohydrate antigens when studying immune responses to viruses.",Dorothy L.

49,Antibody Response to a Nucleocapsid Epitope as a Marker for COVID-19 Disease Severity,"Characterization of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to predict COVID-19 disease trajectories. Ineffective antibodies or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) could derail patients immune responses, for example. ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis epitope-mapped plasma from 86 COVID-19 patients. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including ICU stay, requirement for ventilators, and death. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate both with various comorbidities and ADE hallmarks, including increased IL-6 levels and early IgG response. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within five days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day. The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 diagnostic for the early prediction of disease severity to guide more effective therapeutic interventions.

50,Early induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells associates with rapid viral clearance and mild disease in COVID-19 patients,"Virus-specific humoral and cellular immunity act synergistically to protect the host from viral infection. We interrogated the dynamic changes of virological and immunological parameters in 12 patients with symptomatic acute SARS-CoV-2 infection from disease onset to convalescence or death. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the respiratory tract in parallel with antibodies and circulating T cells specific for various structural (NP, M, ORF3a and spike) and non-structural proteins (ORF7/8, NSP7 and NSP13). We observed that while rapid induction and quantity of humoral responses were associated with increased disease severity, an early induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells was present in patients with mild disease and accelerated viral clearance.

52,Duple extinguishment of COVID-19: single compound synergized inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and direct suppression of inflammatory cytokines in vitro/vivo,"The virus replication and lung inflammation are basic targets for COVID-19 treatment. To effectively treat COVID-19, the best chemical drug should combine inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and direct suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression together. Our SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) crystal structure studies revealed Au(I), derived from auranofin (AF) or gold cluster (GA), could specifically bind thiolate of Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. GA or AF could well inhibit Mpro activity and significantly decrease SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell. Cell studies showed that either AF or GA could down-regulate NF{kappa}B pathway, therefore significantly inhibit inflammatory cytokine level of IL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNF- in macrophage and bronchial epithelial cell, respectively. The lung viral load in GA treated COVID-19 mice (15mg/kg.bw) is significantly lower than that in normal saline (NS, 0.9% NaCl) treated COVID-19 mice, and pathological studies revealed GA treatment (score ~1.8) significantly reduced lung inflammatory injury compared with NS treated COVID-19 mice (score ~3). After normal mice were treated by GA (15mg/kg), the Au ingredient well distributed into lungs and there are no pathological changes in main organs when compared with control mice. The toxicity results revealed GA is more safety than auranofin for cell/mice/rat. The rat pharmacokinetics studies show GA is with high bioavailability (> 90%) in vivo.

53,Multivalency transforms SARS-CoV-2 antibodies into broad and ultrapotent neutralizers,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic. Antibodies are powerful biotherapeutics to fight viral infections; however, discovery of the most potent and broadly acting clones can be lengthy. Here, we used the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit to drive oligomerization of antibody fragments and transform antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into exceptionally potent neutralizers. Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 9 x 10-14 M were achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency enhancements. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral sequence variability together with outstanding potency and Ig-like in vivo bioavailability. This MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody; or MB) platform contributes a new class of medical countermeasures against COVID-19 and an efficient approach to rapidly deploy potent and broadly-acting therapeutics against infectious diseases of global health importance.

54,"The Theory and Practice of the viral dose in neutralization assay: insights on SARS-CoV-2 ""doublethink"" effect.","Due to the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for reliable high-throughput serological assays in order to evaluate the immunological responses against SARS-COV-2 virus and to enable population screening, as well as vaccines and drugs efficacy testing. Several serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are now becoming available in the market. However, it has also become extremely important to have well-established assays with desirable high sensitivity and specificity. To date, the micro-neutralization (MN) assay, is currently considered the gold-standard being capable of evaluating and detecting, functional neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Several protocols exist for microneutralization assays which vary in several steps of the protocol: cell seeding conditions, number of cells seeded, virus amount used in the infection step, virus-serum-cells incubation period etc. These potential differences account for a high degree of variability and inconsistency of the results and using a harmonized protocol for the micro-neutralization assay could potentially solve this.

Given this situation, the main aim of our study was to carry out SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus MN assay in order to investigate which optimal tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) infective dose in use is the most adequate choice for implementation in terms of reproducibility, standardization possibilities and comparability of results. Therefore, we assessed the MN by using two different viral infective doses: a standard dose of 100 TCID50/well and a lower dose of 25 TCID50/well. The results obtained, yielded by MN on using the lower infective dose (25 TCID50), were in line with those obtained with the standard infective dose; in some cases, however, we detected a titre that was one or two dilution steps higher, which maintained all negative samples negative. This suggesting that the lower dose can potentially have a positive impact on the detection and estimation of neutralizing antibodies present in a given sample, showing higher sensitivity but similar specificity and therefore, it would require a more accurate assessment and cross-laboratories standardisation especially when MN is employed as serological assay of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies.",Eleonora Molesti; Alessandro Manenti; Marta Maggetti; Giulia Lapini; Alessandro Torelli; Emanuele Montomoli,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342428,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342428,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
55,The effect of temperature and humidity on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses,"Since emerging in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, and it may become an endemic human pathogen. Understanding the impact of environmental conditions on SARS-CoV-2 viability and its transmission potential is crucial to anticipating epidemic dynamics and designing mitigation strategies. Ambient temperature and humidity are known to have strong effects on the environmental stability of viruses1, but there is little data for SARS-CoV-2, and a general quantitative understanding of how temperature and humidity affect virus stability has remained elusive. Here, we characterise the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at a variety of temperature and humidity conditions, and introduce a mechanistic model that enables accurate prediction of virus stability in unobserved conditions. We find that SARS-CoV-2 survives better at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life was more than 24 hours at 10 {degrees}C and 40 % RH, but approximately an hour and a half at 27 {degrees}C and 65 % RH. Our results highlight scenarios of particular transmission risk, and provide a mechanistic explanation for observed superspreading events in cool indoor environments such as food processing plants. Moreover, our model predicts observations from other human coronaviruses and other studies of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the existence of shared mechanisms that determine environmental stability across a number of enveloped viruses.",Dylan H.

56,Targeting androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 as a therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an adverse effect on the progression of multiple cancers, including prostate cancer, due to the ensuing cytokine storm and associated oncogenic signaling. Epidemiological data showing increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in men suggests a potential role for androgen in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse tissues and human prostate and lung cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. In an overexpression model, and the prostate and lung cells, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens such as enzalutamide/AR-PROTAC, or Camostat treatment attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry in lung and prostate cells. Together, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy and androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with anti-viral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent inflammation driven COVID-19 progression.",Qu Deng; Reyaz ur Rasool; Ronnie M Russell; Ramakrishnan Natesan; Irfan A Asangani,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342782,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342782,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
57,"Social contact patterns among employees in 3 U.S. companies during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, April to June 2020.","Importance: Devising control strategies against diseases such as COVID-19 require understanding of contextual social mixing and contact patterns. There has been no standardized multi-site social contact study conducted in workplace settings in the United States that can be used to broadly inform pandemic preparedness policy in these settings. Objective: The study aimed to characterize the patterns of social contacts and mixing across workplace environments, including on-site or when teleworking. Design: This was a cross-sectional non-probability survey that used standardized social contact diaries to collect data. Employees were requested to record their physical and non-physical contacts in a diary over two consecutive days, documented at the end of each day. Employees from each company were enrolled through email and electronic diaries sent as individual links. Data were collected from April to June 2020. Setting: Two multinational consulting companies and one university administrative department, all located in Georgia, USA. Participants: Employees opted into the study by accepting the invitation on a link sent via email. Main Outcome: The outcome was median number of contacts per person per day. This was stratified by day of data collection, age, sex, race and ethnicity. Results: Of 3,835 employees approached, 357 (9.3%) completed the first day of contact diary of which 304 completed both days of contact diary. There was a median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-21) per respondent on both day one and two. The majority (55%) of contacts involved conversation only, occurred at home (64%), and cumulatively lasted more than 4 hours (38%). Most contacts were repeated, and within same age groups, though participants aged 30-59 years reported substantial inter-generational mixing with children. Conclusion: Participating employees in 3 surveyed workplaces reported few contacts, similar to studies from the UK and China when shelter-in-place orders were in effect during the pandemic. Many contacts were repeated which may limit the spread of infection. Future rounds are planned to assess changes in contact patterns when employees resume work in the office after the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic.",Moses Chapa Kiti; Obianuju G Aguolu; Carol Liu; Ana Mesa Restrepo; Rachel Regina; Kathryn Willebrand; Chandra Couzens; Tilman Bartelsmeyer; Kristin Nicole Bratton; Samuel M Jenness; Steven Riley; Alessia Melegaro; Faruque Ahmed; Fauzia Malik; Ben Lopman; Saad B Omer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212423,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212423,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,True

We demonstrate robust IgM autoantibodies that recognize angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in 18/66 (27%) patients with severe COVID-19, which are rare (2/52; 3.8%) in hospitalized patients who are not ventilated. The antibodies do not undergo class-switching to IgG, suggesting a T-independent antibody response. Purified IgM from anti-ACE2 patients activates complement. Pathological analysis of lung obtained at autopsy shows endothelial cell staining for IgM in blood vessels in some patients.

Despite being an important issue concerning women and girls in the menstruating age group, access to menstrual hygiene products neglected during the COVID19 pandemic. Further, there is no evidence of the practice of menstrual hygiene products in Indian settings during this period. This paper investigates the prevalence of socio-demographic correlations of access to sanitary napkins among college students in Lucknow. Methods An online retrospective cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lucknow in September 2020. In total, 1439 participants took part in the survey. After removing 55 participants, those quit the survey by clicking on the disagree button and 13 were not satisfying inclusion criteria. So the final samples were 1371, which were included in the analysis. Students of UG and PG currently studying in colleges in the Lucknow were eligible to participate. The data collection was anonymous. Responses were analysed using descriptive and bivariate logistic regression. Results In this study, 1371 students were included, making a response rate of 96.2 percent. Nearly 12.5 percent of students reported about difficulty encountered during the lockdown. Muslims, Father education illiterate or upto12th, father occupation as farmer, monthly salary less than 25 thousand, residence as rural, and history of reusable clothes were more likely to face problems to access sanitary pads during the lockdown in Lucknow (P < .05). Conclusions During COVID-19 lockdown, about 12.5 percent of girls were dependent on either locally available resources as absorbents during menstruation or paid more to access in Lucknow. Because of the lockdown, many people have lost their livelihood.

64,"Characteristics and Factors Associated with COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Mortality Across Race and Ethnicity","Background Data on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited. We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across the major racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large, integrated health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and August 30, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Findings 289,294 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, of whom 27.5% were non-White minorities. 15,605 persons tested positive, with minorities representing 58.0%. Disparities were widest among Hispanics, who represented 40.5% of infections but 12.8% of those tested. Hispanics were generally younger and had fewer comorbidities except diabetes than White patients. Of the 3,197 patients hospitalized, 58.9% were non-White. 459 patients died, of whom 49.8% were minorities. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increase odds of testing positive and hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities except American Indian/Alaska Native. Highest odds of testing SARS-CoV-2 positive was for Hispanic patients (OR [95% CI]: 3.68 [3.52-3.84]) and highest odds of COVID-19 hospitalization was for Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients (2.13 [1.48 - 3.06]). Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity including need for mechanical ventilation. In multivariate modeling, Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with increased odds of hospital mortality (1.75 [1.15-2.67]) among patients over age 70, but hospital mortality was not increased for any race/ethnicity sub-population in the multivariate model. Interpretation Major healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a higher rate, and despite younger in age, required excess hospitalization and need for mechanical ventilation compared to their expected demographic proportions. As characteristics of patients varying between race/ethnicity, targeted, culturally-responsive interventions are needed to address the increased risk of poor outcomes among minority populations with COVID-19.

65,Development of a deep learning classifier to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from look-a-like pathology on lung ultrasound,"Objectives Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a portable, low cost respiratory imaging tool but is challenged by user dependence and lack of diagnostic specificity. It is unknown whether the advantages of LUS implementation could be paired with deep learning techniques to match or exceed human-level, diagnostic specificity among similar appearing, pathological LUS images. Design A convolutional neural network was trained on LUS images with B lines of different etiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set was compared to surveyed LUS-competent physicians. Setting Two tertiary Canadian hospitals. Participants 600 LUS videos (121,381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either 1) COVID-19, Non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) and 3) Hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE). Results The trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (AUC 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies. This was significantly better than physician ability (AUCs of 0.697, 0.704, 0.967 for the COVID, NCOVID and HPE classes, respectively), p < 0.01. Conclusions A deep learning model can distinguish similar appearing LUS pathology, including COVID-19, that cannot be distinguished by humans.

66,Physical Activity Decreases the Prevalence of COVID-19-associated Hospitalization: Brazil EXTRA Study,"Objectives: We compared physical activity levels before the outbreak and quarantine measures with COVID-19-associated hospitalization prevalence in surviving patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we investigated the association of physical activity levels with symptoms of the disease, length of hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. Methods: Between June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We shared the electronic link to the questionnaire on the internet. In this cross-sectional study, we collected data about clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay) and cofactors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases, socioeconomic and educational, and physical activity levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short version). Results: Out of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate analysis, sex, age, and BMI were all associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Men had a higher prevalence of hospitalization (66.6%, P=0.013). Patients older than 65 years, obese, and with preexisting disease had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. In a multivariate regression model, performance of at least 150 min/wk (moderate) and/or 75 min/wk (vigorous) physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of hospitalizations after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and preexisting diseases (PR=0.657; P=0.046). Conclusions: Sufficient physical activity levels are associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity physical activity reduces this prevalence by 34.3%.",Francis Ribeiro Souza; Daisy Motta-Santos; Douglas dos Santos Soares; Juliana Beust Lima; Gustavo Goncalves Cardozo; Luciano Santos Pinto Guimaraes; Carlos Eduardo Negrao; Marcelo Rodrigues dos Santos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212704,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212704,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,True
67,Heterogeneity in transmissibility and shedding SARS-CoV-2 via droplets and aerosols,"A growing number of studies provide insight into how SARS-CoV-2 spreads1-7. Yet, many factors that characterize its transmissibility remain unclear, including mechanistic correlates of overdispersion, viral kinetics, the extent to which respiratory droplets and aerosols carry viable virus and the infectiousness of asymptomatic, presymptomatic and pediatric cases7. Here, we developed a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) via systematic review and investigated these factors using meta-analyses and modeling. By comparing cases of COVID-19, SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, we found that heterogeneity in rVL was associated with overdispersion and facilitated the distinctions in individual variation in infectiousness among these emergent diseases. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity was broad throughout the infectious period, although rVL tended to peak at 1 day from symptom onset (DFSO) and be elevated for 1-5 DFSO. While most cases presented minimal risk, highly infectious ones could spread SARS-CoV-2 by talking, singing or breathing, which shed virions at comparable rates via droplets and aerosols. Coughing shed considerable quantities of virions, predominantly via droplets, and greatly increased the contagiousness of many symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Asymptomatic and symptomatic infections showed similar likelihoods of expelling aerosols with SARS-CoV-2, as did adult and pediatric cases. Children tended to be less contagious by droplet spread than adults based on tendencies of symptomatology rather than rVL.

68,Repurposed antiviral drugs for COVID-19; interim WHO SOLIDARITY trial results,"BACKGROUND WHO expert groups recommended mortality trials in hospitalized COVID-19 of four re-purposed antiviral drugs. METHODS Study drugs were Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir (fixed-dose combination with Ritonavir) and Interferon-{beta}1a (mainly subcutaneous; initially with Lopinavir, later not). COVID-19 inpatients were randomized equally between whichever study drugs were locally available and open control (up to 5 options: 4 active and local standard-of-care). The intent-to-treat primary analyses are of in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs its controls (concurrently allocated the same management without that drug, despite availability). Kaplan-Meier 28-day risks are unstratified; log-rank death rate ratios (RRs) are stratified for age and ventilation at entry. RESULTS In 405 hospitals in 30 countries 11,266 adults were randomized, with 2750 allocated Remdesivir, 954 Hydroxychloroquine, 1411 Lopinavir, 651 Interferon plus Lopinavir, 1412 only Interferon, and 4088 no study drug. Compliance was 94-96% midway through treatment, with 2-6% crossover. 1253 deaths were reported (at median day 8, IQR 4-14). Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 12% (39% if already ventilated at randomization, 10% otherwise). Death rate ratios (with 95% CIs and numbers dead/randomized, each drug vs its control) were: Remdesivir RR=0.95 (0.81-1.11, p=0.50; 301/2743 active vs 303/2708 control), Hydroxychloroquine RR=1.19 (0.89-1.59, p=0.23; 104/947 vs 84/906), Lopinavir RR=1.00 (0.79-1.25, p=0.97; 148/1399 vs 146/1372) and Interferon RR=1.16 (0.96-1.39, p=0.11; 243/2050 vs 216/2050). No study drug definitely reduced mortality (in unventilated patients or any other subgroup of entry characteristics), initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration. CONCLUSIONS These Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The mortality findings contain most of the randomized evidence on Remdesivir and Interferon, and are consistent with meta-analyses of mortality in all major trials. (Funding: WHO.

69,A high throughput RNA displacement assay for screening SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex towards developing therapeutics for COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, evades the human immune system by capping its RNA. This process protects the viral RNA and is essential for its replication. Multiple viral proteins are involved in this RNA capping process including the nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) which is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2-O-methyltransferase. Nsp16 is significantly active when in complex with another nonstructural protein, nsp10, which plays a key role in its stability and activity. Here we report the development of a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based RNA displacement assay for nsp10-nsp16 complex in 384-well format with a Z'-Factor of 0.6, suitable for high throughput screening. In this process, we purified the nsp10-nsp16 complex to higher than 95% purity and confirmed its binding to the methyl donor SAM, product of the reaction, SAH, and a common methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). The assay was further validated by screening a library of 1124 drug-like compounds.

70,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in vitro upon blocking N- and O-glycan elaboration,"The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its receptor binding domain (RBD), and its primary receptor ACE2 are extensively glycosylated. The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.",Qi Yang; Thomas A. Hughes; Anju Kelkar; Xinheng Yu; Kai Cheng; Sheldon J. Park; We-Chiao Huang; Jonathan F.

71,Multiplexed proteomics and imaging of resolving and lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung,"Normal tissue physiology and repair depends on communication with the immune system. Understanding this communication at the molecular level in intact tissue requires new methods. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in acute respiratory distress, thrombosis and death, has been studied primarily in accessible liquid specimens such as blood, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage, all of which are peripheral to the primary site of infection in the lung. Here, we describe the combined use of multiplexed deep proteomics with multiplexed imaging to profile infection and its sequelae directly in fixed lung tissue specimens obtained from necropsy of infected animals and autopsy of human decedents. We characterize multiple steps in disease response from cytokine accumulation and protein phosphorylation to activation of receptors, changes in signaling pathways, and crosslinking of fibrin to form clots. Our data reveal significant differences between naturally resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques and lethal COVID-19 in humans. The approach we describe is broadly applicable to other tissues and diseases.

72,The Strand-biased Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 and Unbalanced Inhibition by Remdesivir,"SARS-CoV-2, a positive single-stranded RNA virus, caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Although its sense-mRNA architecture was reported, its anti-sense strand was unexplored. Here, we deeply sequenced both strands of RNA and found SARS-CoV-2 transcription is strongly biased to form the sense strand. During negative strand synthesis, apart from canonical sub-genomic ORFs, numerous non-canonical fusion transcripts are formed, driven by 3-15 nt sequence homology scattered along the genome but more prone to be inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase inhibitor Remdesivir. The drug also represses more of the negative than the positive strand synthesis as supported by a mathematic simulation model and experimental quantifications. Overall, this study opens new sights into SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis and may facilitate the anti-viral drug design.

73,Evidence of antigenic imprinting in sequential Sarbecovirus immunization,"Antigenic imprinting, which describes the bias of antibody response due to previous immune history, can influence vaccine effectiveness and has been reported in different viruses. Give that COVID-19 vaccine development is currently a major focus of the world, there is a lack of understanding of how background immunity influence antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. This study provides evidence for antigenic imprinting in Sarbecovirus, which is the subgenus that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to. Specifically, we sequentially immunized mice with two antigenically distinct Sarbecovirus strains, namely SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We found that the neutralizing antibodies triggered by the sequentially immunization are dominantly against the one that is used for priming.

74,Systematic analysis of innate immune antagonism reveals vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2,"The innate immune system efficiently defends the human host against viral pathogens. Thus, viruses evolved strategies to counteract immune activation. Here, we systematically analysed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins on three major arms of our cell-intrinsic innate immune defences: interferon (IFN) induction, cytokine signalling and autophagy. Subsequent mechanistic analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins target the respective signalling cascades at multiple steps. For example, we show that Nsp14 reduces endogenous IFN receptor levels and ORF3a and ORF7a perturb the late endosomal/trans-Golgi network. Our data demonstrates that most antagonistic activities are conserved between proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the closely related bat RaTG13-CoV and the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1. However, SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is strikingly more potent in suppressing IFN induction and signalling than its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. This may help explain the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitated its rapid spread. Overall our analyses revealed that IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{lambda}1 signalling are antagonised the least, leaving SARS-CoV-2 highly susceptible to these two cytokines. Their combination synergistically potentiated the anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Taken together, our results allow an explanation for differences in susceptibility towards IFNs and provide evidence that rational immune activation may be an effective future therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",Manuel Hayn; Maximilian Hirschenberger; Lennart Koepke; Jan Hendrik Straub; Rayhane Nchioua; Susanne Klute; Caterina Prelli Bozzo; Wasim Aftab; Fabian Zech; Carina Conzelmann; Janis Alexander Mueller; Smitha Srinivasachar Badarinarayan; Christina Martina Stuerzel; Ignasi Forne; Steffen Stenger; Karl-Klaus Conzelmann; Jan Muench; Daniel Sauter; Axel Imhof; Frank Kirchhoff; Konstantin Maria Johannes Sparrer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.340612,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.340612,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,False

Rapid and comprehensive analysis of both pathogen and host sequencing data is critical to track infection and inform therapies. In this study, we performed unbiased metatranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples from COVID-19 patients using a newly-developed RNA-seq library construction method (TRACE-seq), which utilizes tagmentation activity of Tn5 on RNA/DNA hybrids. This approach avoids the laborious and time-consuming steps in traditional RNA-seq procedure, and hence is fast, sensitive and convenient.

76,Quantitative Assays Reveal Cell Fusion at Minimal Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Fusion-from-Without,"Cell entry of the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by its spike protein S. As main antigenic determinant, S protein is in focus of antibody-based prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Besides particle-cell fusion, S mediates fusion between infected and uninfected cells resulting in syncytia formation. Here we present quantitative assay systems covering not only particle-cell and cell-cell fusion, but also demonstrating fusion-from-without (FFWO), the formation of syncytia induced by S-containing viral particles in absence of newly synthesized S protein. Based on complementation of split {beta}-galactosidase and virus-like-particles (VLPs) displaying S protein, this assay can be performed at BSL-1. All three assays provided readouts with a high dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratios covering several orders of magnitude. The data obtained confirm the enhancing effect of trypsin and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on membrane fusion. Neutralizing antibodies as well as sera from convalescent patients inhibited particle-cell fusion with high efficiency. Cell-cell fusion, in contrast, was only moderately inhibited despite requiring much lower levels of S protein, which were below the detection limit of flow cytometry and Western blot. The data indicate that syncytia formation as a pathological consequence in tissues of Covid-19 patients can proceed at low levels of S protein and may not be effectively prevented by antibodies.",Samuel A.

77,A Common Methodological Phylogenomics Framework for intra-patient heteroplasmies to infer SARS-CoV-2 sublineages and tumor clones,"We present a common methodological framework to infer the phylogenomics from genomic data, be it reads of SARS-CoV-2 of multiple COVID-19 patients or bulk DNAseq of the tumor of a cancer patient. The commonality is in the phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads in both scenarios. While there is evidence of heteroplasmy, i.e., multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the same COVID-19 patient; to date, there is no evidence of sublineages recombining within the same patient. The heterogeneity in a patients tumor is analogous to intra-patient heteroplasmy and the absence of recombination in the cells of tumor is a widely accepted assumption. Just as the different frequencies of the genomic variants in a tumor presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that so do the different variant frequencies in the viral reads, offering the means to infer the multiple co-infecting sublineages. We describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We also make some additional discoveries. We uncovered new potential parallel mutation in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

79,"Predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Athens, Greece","Background: The epidemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths. Numerous efforts are being made to clarify how the infection progresses and potential factors associated with disease severity and mortality. We investigated the mortality in Greek hospitalized COVID-19 patients and also the predictors of this mortality. Methods: Study population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis. Results: The mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age [&ge;]65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.

80,Should international borders re-open? The impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 importation risk,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread across the world at an unprecedented pace, reaching over 200 countries and territories in less than three months. In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open.

Participants Study involved 1,294 adult community residents in the 23 districts of the state. Results The respondents were aged between 18 and 80 years with average age of 39.6 years (SD = 11.9 years). A total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary education. Almost all respondents 1,271 (98.2%) had heard about COVID 19. The three most common sources of information about COVID 19 were radio jingles 1102 (86.7%), television adverts 940 (74.0%) and announcements in Church 612 (48.2%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had poor knowledge of COVID 19. About 1167 (90.2%) of the respondents who were aware of COVID 19 acknowledged that COVID 19 is a problem in the state while 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they were unlikely contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of the respondents washed all critical parts of the hand correctly. Conclusion Risk communication interventions during pandemics need to be based on an understanding of the gaps in knowledge, attitude, perceptions, and practice. Broadcast media has a pivotal role to play in risk communication for behaviour change for the control of current and future epidemics in this population.",Golden Owhonda; Omosivie Maduka; Ifeoma Nwadiuto; Charles Tobin-West; Esther Azi; Chibianotu Ojimah; Datonye Alasia; Ayo-Maria Olofinuka; Vetty Agala; John Nwolim Paul; Doris Nria; Chinenye Okafor; Ifeoma Ndekwu; Chikezie Opara; Chris Newsom,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210864,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210864,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
82,Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based population: Results from an epidemiological study,"Background: Studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population. Methods: We pooled statewide, community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection. Conclusions: When laboratory testing is not readily accessible, symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.",Brian E Dixon; Kara Wools-Kaloustian; William F Fadel; Thoomas J Duszynski; Constantin Yiannoutsos; Paul K Halverson; Nir Menachemi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210922,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

84,"High Food Insecurity in Latinx Families and Associated COVID-19 Infection in the Greater Bay Area, California","Background: Food insecurity impacts nearly one-in-four Latinx households in the United States and has been exacerbated by the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We examined the impact of COVID-19 on household and child food security in three preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx urban cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area (N=375 households, 1,875 individuals). Households were initially recruited during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this COVID sub-study, participants responded to a 15-minute telephonic interview. Participants answered 18 questions from the US Food Security Food Module (US HFSSM), described food consumption, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection as per community or hospital-based testing. Food security and insecurity levels were compared with prior year metrics. Results: We found low levels of household food security in Latinx families (by cohort: 29.2%; 34.2%; 60.0%) and child food security (56.9%; 54.1%; 78.0%) with differences between cohorts explained by self-reported levels of education and employment status. Food security levels were much lower than those reported previously in two cohorts where data had been recorded from prior years. Reported history of COVID-19 infection in households was 4.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI); 1.5-14.3%); 7.2% (95%CI; 3.6-13.9%) and 3.5% (95%CI; 1.7-7.2%) by cohort and was associated with food insecurity in the two larger cohorts (p=0.03; p=0.01 respectively). Conclusions: Latinx families in the Bay Area with children are experiencing a sharp rise in food insecurity levels during the COVID-19 epidemic. Food insecurity, similar to other indices of poverty, is associated with increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive interventions are needed to address food insecurity in Latinx populations and further studies are needed to better assess independent associations between household food insecurity, poor nutritional health and risk of COVID-19 infection.",Milagro Escobar; Andrea DeCastro Mendez; Maria Romer Encinas; Janet Wojcicki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210906,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210906,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

Methods: A graph network was constructed from the publicly available CORD-19 database of COVID-19-related publications using an engine leveraging medical knowledgebases to identify discrete medical concepts and an open source tool (Gephi) used to visualise the network. Results: The network shows connections between disease, medication and procedures identified from title and abstracts of 195,958 COVID-19 related publications (CORD-19 Dataset). Connections between terms with few publications, those unconnected to the main network and those irrelevant were not displayed. Nodes were coloured by knowledgebase and node size related to the number of publications containing the term. The dataset and visualisations made publicly accessible via a webtool.

86,COVID-CT-Mask-Net: Prediction of COVID-19 from CT Scans Using Regional Features,"We present COVID-CT-Mask-Net model that predicts COVID-19 from CT scans. The model works in two stages: first, it detects the instances of ground glass opacity and consolidation in CT scans, then predicts the condition from the ranked bounding box detections. To develop the solution for the three-class problem (COVID, common pneumonia and control), we used the COVIDx-CT dataset derived from the dataset of CT scans collected by China National Center for Bioinformation. We use about $5\%$ of the training split of COVIDx-CT to train the model, and without any complicated data normalization, balancing and regularization, and training only a small fraction of the model's parameters, we achieve a $\mathbf{90.80\%}$ COVID sensitivity, $\mathbf{91.62\%}$ common pneumonia sensitivity and $\mathbf{92.10\%}$ normal sensitivity, and an overall accuracy of $\textbf{91.66\%}$ on the test data (21182 images), bringing the ratio of test/train data to \textbf{7.06}, which implies a very high capacity of the model to generalize to new data. We also establish an important result, that ranked regional predictions (bounding boxes with scores) in Mask R-CNN can be used to make accurate predictions of the image class. The full source code, models and pretrained weights are available on \url{https://github.com/AlexTS1980/COVID-CT-Mask-Net}. %One of the challenges of training a machine learning model to detect the presence of COVID-related areas in CT scans is the scarcity of segmented data. We present the COVID-CT-Mask-Net, a COVID19 detection model based on instance segmentation of COVID-related areas in CT scans. The model is first trained to segment instances of two types of COVID correlates: ground-glass opacity and consolidation. Then, this model is augmented with three classification modules to predict COVID from the regional features in CT scans. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting COVID in patients, it is conceptually simpler, requires a smaller dataset for training compared to other machine learning models, and does not require tricks to balance the data.",Aram Ter-Sarkisov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211052,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211052,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

88,CORRELATION BETWEEN SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODY SCREENING BY IMMUNOASSAY AND NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TESTING,"Background: Passive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP) represents a promising alternative for the treatment of SARS CoV 2 infection. The efficacy of CP therapy has been associated with high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the plasma of recovered patients, but the assays for quantifying nAbs are not widely available. Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS CoV 2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of the CP potential donors. Methods: Two hundred and fourteen CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS CoV 2 antibodies using two commercial immunoassays (IA): Anti SARS CoV 2 ELISA IgG EUROIMMUN and Anti SARS CoV 2 Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott. In parallel, quantification of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) was performed using the Cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE VNT). Three criteria for identifying donors with high titers of nAbs (more than 160) were tested: Criterion1: Curve ROC Method; Criterion 2: Conditional decision tree considering only the results from the IA and Criterion 3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables. Results: The performance of Abbott and EUROIMMUN immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers more than 1:160. Regarding the three studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers (more than 1:160): 1) Criterion 1 showed 76.1% accuracy when the S/CO cut-off of 4.65 was used, 2) Criterion 2 presented 76.1% accuracy if the S/CO more than 4.57 was applied and 3) Criterion 3 had 71.6% accuracy if either S/CO more than 4.57 or S/CO between 2.68 and 4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms occurred less than 19 days from donor recruiting were used. Conclusion: The results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (S/CO) can be used to predict high nAbs titers of potential CP donors. This study has proposed three different criteria for identifying donors with more than 160 nAbs titer based on either solely S/CO results or S/CO together with clinical variables, all with high efficacy and accuracy.",ALFREDO MENDRONE-JUNIOR; CARLA DINARDO; SUZETE FERREIRA; ANNA NISHIA; NANCI SALLES; CESAR ALMEIDA-NETO; DEBORA HAMASAKI; TILA FACINCANI; LUCAS ALVES; RAFAEL MACHADO; DANIELLE ARAUJO; EDISON DURIGON; VANDERSON ROCHA; ESTER SABINO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210005,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210005,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
89,"School education during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - Which concept is safe, feasible and environmentally sound?","The future belongs to children and they need education to shape the future with foresight and intention. Children therefore have the right to education, according to Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, professional education is not everything, because children must also experience their strengths and weaknesses together and educate each other to be responsible and considerate people, so that they become socially valuable personalities. Only in this way can they shape the future in a peaceful and humane way. Therefore, attending school is essential. However, children also have the right to protection and care by their parents and the state, because the welfare of the child must also be given priority in accordance with Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The question is therefore how schooling in community schools can be realized during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without exposing children to an unnecessary risk of infection. It is not only about the children, because if the children are at risk, then so are their parents and grandparents and ultimately society as a whole. There are numerous concepts that promise safety in schools during the pandemic. When selecting concepts, the costs must of course be weighed against the benefits. People rightly expect an efficient use of resources. This means that either the set goal is achieved with the least possible resources or that the available resources are used to achieve the greatest possible approximation to the goal. In addition to the financial resources, however, the long-term consequences for the state, the economy, the population and the environment under the pressure of the pandemic must also be taken into account. Social cohesion and democracy must not be jeopardized either. Various protection concepts are currently under discussion. Often the advantages are overstated and the disadvantages concealed. Furthermore, some arguments are based on assumptions that are not true. The aim of this study is to provide a comparative assessment of the main protection concepts and to demonstrate, with the help of experimental analyses, the extent to which the protection concepts are effective. We will show that a comparatively high level of safety against infection in classrooms can be technically ensured without exposing children to masks. At the same time, the protection concept makes economic sense and the burden on the environment is comparatively low, so that infection prevention and climate protection do not have to be weighed against each other, because infection prevention and climate protection are political and social goals that have to be achieved together.",Christian J.

90,High and increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity in England during end September beginning October 2020: REACT-1 round 5 updated report,"Background REACT-1 is quantifying prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among random samples of the population in England based on PCR testing of self-administered nose and throat swabs. Here we report results from the fifth round of observations for swabs collected from the 18th September to 5th October 2020. This report updates and should be read alongside our round 5 interim report. Methods Representative samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 175,000 people at each round. Prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimation of reproduction number (R) and time trends between and within rounds using exponential growth or decay models. Results 175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October. Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). These results correspond to 1 in 170 people currently swab-positive for the virus and approximately 45,000 new infections each day. At regional level, the highest prevalence is in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East with strongest regional growth in North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West Midlands. Conclusion Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England, with highest rates in the North of England. Prevalence has increased in all age groups, including those at highest risk.

Methods We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set. Results We analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.38 (0.38-0.39) for scores above four points.

92,Understanding the Los Angeles County Coronavirus Epidemic: The Critical Role of Intrahousehold Transmission,"We tracked the course of the COVID-19 epidemic among the approximately 300 communities comprising Los Angeles County. The epidemic, we found, had three distinct phases. During Phase I, from early March through about April 4, initial seeding of infection in relatively affluent areas was followed by radial geographic extension to adjoining communities. During Phase II, which continued to about July 11, COVID-19 cases continued to rise at a slower rate, and became increasingly concentrated in four geographic foci of infection across the county. This phase saw changes in two indicators of social mobility: the proportion of location-tracked smartphones staying at home, and the number of smartphones visiting a gym. For both indicators, those communities with a larger reduction in social mobility during April reported fewer new COVID-19 cases in May. During Phase III, COVID-19 incidence only gradually declined, remaining as high as the incidence seen at the end of Phase I. Across communities, the prevalence of households at high risk for intergenerational transmission was strongly correlated with the persistence of continued COVID-19 propagation. This association was even stronger in those communities with a higher rate of gym attendance in Phase II. The map of the prevalence of at-risk households in Los Angeles County coincided strikingly with the map of cumulative COVID-19 incidence. These findings, taken together, support the critical role of household structure in the persistent propagation of COVID-19 infections in Los Angeles County. Public health policy needs to be reoriented from a focus on protecting the individual to a focus on protecting the household.",Jeffrey E Harris,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211045,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211045,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
93,Prioritisation of population groups with the most interactions for COVID-19 vaccination can substantially reduce total fatalities,"The rapid development of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an unprecedented achievement. Once vaccines become mass produced, they will have to be distributed to almost the entire population to prevent deaths and permit prompt economic recovery. The necessity to vaccinate a large number of people in a short period of time, and possibly with insufficient vaccine doses to cover most, creates in itself a new challenge for governments and health authorities: which population groups (by age or other criteria) should be targeted first and what sequence must be followed, if any at all, to achieve the minimum number of fatalities? In this work, we demonstrate the importance and impact of optimally planning the priorities for vaccine deployment by population groups using a modified SEIR-type model for the COVID-19 outbreak considering age-related groups. Finding the absolute guaranteed best solution of the mathematical optimisation problem may be hard, if even possible, and would likely require intense computational resources for every possible case study scenario. In this work, several strategies are evaluated and compared, in an attempt to approach the most effective possible vaccination priority sequence in an example case study using demographic and epidemiological data from Spain. The minimum total fatalities at the end of the vaccination campaign is the objective pursued. The population groups classifications are established based on relevant differences in mortality (due to their age) and risk-related behaviour such as their number of daily person-to-person interactions. Assuming a capacity limited constant vaccination rate, vaccination distribution strategies were evaluated for different vaccine effectiveness levels and different percentages of final vaccine population coverage. Our results unambiguously show how planning vaccination by priority groups can achieve dramatic reductions in total fatalities (more than 70% in some cases) compared to no prioritisation. The results also indicate in all cases, for all vaccine effectiveness and coverage values evaluated, that the criteria for groups vaccination priority should not be those with the highest mortality but rather those the highest number of daily person-to-person interactions. Strikingly, our results show in all cases, that prioritisation of groups with the highest mortality but less social interactions, may lead to significantly larger numbers of final total fatalities, even higher as if no group priorities were established at all. The explanation, clearly displayed by the mechanistic model, is that vaccination avoids infections that reduce mortality not only from the vaccinated group itself but also from the projected secondary and subsequent infections inflicted on the rest of the population by those vaccinated in that group. Precisely this amplification effect (exponential nature of the curve) appears to cause the larger reduction in total fatalities if the groups with the most interactions are vaccinated first. The possible contradiction of these results with some published recommendations highlight the importance of conducting an open comprehensive and rigorous analysis of this problem leaving behind any subjective preconceptions.",Jorge Rodriguez; Mauricio Paton; Juan M Acuna,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211094,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211094,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
94,COVID-19 in Italy: targeted testing as a proxy of limited health care facilities and a key to reducing hospitalization rate and the death toll.,"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) has induced a worldwide pandemic, notably in Italy, one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, which witnessed a death toll unseen in the recent past. There are potentially many factors, such as infections from undetected index cases, early vs late testing strategies, limited health care facilities etc., that might have aggravated the COVID-19 situation in Italy. We developed a COVID-19 specific infection epidemic model composed of susceptible (S), exposed (E), carrier (C), infected (I), recovery (R) and dead (D) (SECIRD), specifically parameterized for Italy to disentangle the impact of these factors and their implications on infection dynamics to help planning an effective control strategy for a possible second wave. Our model discriminates between detected infected and undetected individuals who played a crucial role in the disease spreading and is not well addressed by classical SEIR-like transmission models. We first estimated the number of undetected infections through a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, which ranges from ~7 to ~22 fold higher than reported infections, depending upon regions. We exploited this information to evaluate the impact of the undetected component on the evolution of the pandemic and the benefits of an enhanced testing strategy. In high testing regions like Veneto, 18% of all infections resulted in hospitalization, while for Lombardia and Piemonte, it is 25% and 27%, respectively. We investigated the impact of an overwhelmed health care system upon death toll by applying hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) capacities in the SECIRD model, and we estimated a 10% reduction in death in Lombardia, the worst hit region, if a higher number of hospital facilities had been available since the beginning. Adopting a combined strategy of rapid early and targeted testing (~10 fold) with increased hospital capacity would help in avoiding bottlenecks affecting the health care system. Our results demonstrate that the early testing would have a strong impact on the overall hospital accessibility and, hence, upon death toll (~20% to 50% reduction) and could have mitigated the lack of facilities at the crucial middle stage of the epidemic.",Arnab Bandyopadhyay; Marta Schips; Tanmay Mitra; Sahamoddin Khailaie; Sebastian Binder; Michael Meyer-Hermann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211169,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211169,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
95,SARS-CoV-2 sequencing reveals rapid transmission from college student clusters resulting in morbidity and deaths in vulnerable populations,"College reopening decisions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represent a trade-off between competing risks to students, faculty and staff, and college finances. Additionally, risks taken in reopening colleges can impose significant burdens on individuals living in surrounding communities. Many colleges that reopened for in-person instruction have reported frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. La Crosse County, Wisconsin experienced a substantial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (2,002 cases in September 2020) that coincided with the return to in-person instruction at three local academic institutions. Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 cases in La Crosse during that period found rapid expansion of two viral substrains. Although the majority of cases were among college-age individuals, from a total of 111 genomes sequenced we identified rapid transmission of the virus into more vulnerable populations. Eight sampled genomes represented two independent transmission events into two skilled nursing facilities, resulting in two fatalities.

96,Early Crowdfunding Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: As the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the US, policymakers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of online crowdfunding to defray these costs. We examined the online crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Methods: On May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns created between January 1 and May 10, 2020 on GoFundMe and identified the subset of COVID-related campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored incidence of COVID-related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time and compared campaign characteristics to non-COVID-related campaigns after March 11 when the pandemic was declared. Results: We found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe online crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-related campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 cases declined more than tenfold across all states. COVID-related campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period. Conclusions: Online crowdfunding appears to be a transient stopgap, predicated on the novelty of an emergency rather than the true sustained need of a community. Rather, crowdfunding activity is likely an early marker for communities in acute distress that could be used by governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.",Sameh Nagui Saleh; Christoph U.

98,Using Automated-Machine Learning to Predict COVID-19 Patient Survival: Identify Influential Biomarkers,"Background: In a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to develop and compare between multiple machine learning (ML) models that predict the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection and identified the best-performing model. In addition, we investigated which biomarkers are the most influential in generating an accurate model. We believe an ML model such as this could be a useful tool for clinicians stratifying hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients. Methods: The data was retrospectively collected from Clinical Looking Glass (CLG) on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 through a nasopharyngeal specimen by real-time RT-PCR and admitted between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020 (4376 patients) at our institution. We collected 47 biomarkers from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity, and tracked whether a patient survived or not for one month following this time. We utilized the autoML from H2O.ai, an open source package for R language. The autoML generated 20 ML models and ranked them by area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) on the test set. We selected the best model (model_var_47) and chose a threshold probability that maximized F2 score to make a binary classifier: dead or alive. Subsequently, we ranked the relative importance of variables that generated model_var_47 and chose the 10 most influential variables. Next, we reran the autoML with these 10 variables and likewise selected the model with the best AUCPR on the test set (model_var_10). Again, threshold probability that maximized F2 score for model_var_10 was chosen to make a binary classifier. We calculated and compared the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicate value (PPV) for model_var_10 and model_var_47. Results: The best model that autoML generated using all 47 variables was the stacked ensemble model of all models (AUCPR = 0.836). The most influential variables were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, troponin, and glucose. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 most important variables, it did not significantly affect the performance (AUCPR= 0.828). For the binary classifiers, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of model_var_47 was 83.6%, 87.7%, and 69.8% respectively, while for model_var_10 they were 90.9%, 71.1%, and 51.8% respectively. Conclusions: By using autoML, we developed high-performing models that predict patient mortality from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified the most important biomarkers correlated with mortality. This ML model can be used as a decision supporting tool for medical practitioners to efficiently triage COVID-19 infected patients. From our literature review, this will be the largest COVID-19 patient cohort to train ML models and the first to utilize autoML.

99,Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in oral fluids,Current commercially available methods for reliably detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remain expensive and inaccessible due to the need for whole blood collection by highly trained phlebotomists using personal protective equipment (PPE). We evaluated an antibody detection approach utilizing the OraSure Technologies' Oral Antibody Collection Device (OACD) and their proprietary SARS-CoV-2 total antibody detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

100,"How Policies on Restaurants, Bars, Nightclubs, Masks, Schools, and Travel Influenced Swiss COVID-19 Reproduction Ratios","The role of complete lockdowns in reducing the reproduction ratios (Rt) of COVID-19 is now established. However, the persisting reality in many countries is no longer a complete lockdown, but restrictions of varying degrees using different choices of Non-pharmaceutical interaction (NPI) policies. A scientific basis for understanding the effectiveness of these graded NPI policies in reducing the Rt is urgently needed to address the concerns on personal liberties and economic activities. In this work, we develop a systematic relation between the degrees of NPIs implemented by the 26 cantons in Switzerland during March 9 to September 13 and their respective contributions to the Rt. Using a machine learning framework, we find that Rt which should ideally be lower than 1.0, has significant contributions in the post-lockdown scenario from the different activities - restaurants (0.0523 (CI. 0.0517-0.0528)), bars (0.030 (CI. 0.029-0.030)), and nightclubs (0.154 (CI. 0.154-0.156)). Activities which keep the land-borders open (0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178)), and tourism related activities contributed comparably 0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178). However, international flights with a quarantine did not add further to the Rt of the cantons. The requirement of masks in public transport and secondary schools contributed to an overall 0.025 (CI. 0.018-0.030) reduction in Rt, compared to the baseline usage even when there are no mandates. Although causal relations are not guaranteed by the model framework, it nevertheless provides a fine-grained justification for the relative merits of choice and the degree of the NPIs and a data-driven strategy for mitigating Rt.",C.

101,Use of antivirals and antibiotics for COVID-19 in Mexico City: A Real-World Multicenter Cohort Study,"We aimed to characterize real-world use of antivirals and antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 and their associations with mortality. We conducted a real-world retrospective cohort study in 688 primary-to-tertiary medical units in Mexico City; 395,343 patients were evaluated for suspected COVID-19 between February 24 and September 14, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (n=137,012) were included; those receiving unspecified antivirals (n=137), excluded, and groups of antivirals with <30 patients (n=20), eliminated. Survival and mortality risk analyses were done for patients receiving antivirals, antibiotics, both, or none (exposition groups). 136,855 patients were analyzed; mean age 44.2 (SD:16.8) years; 51.3% were men. 16.6% received an antiviral (3%), antibiotic (10%), or both (3.6%). More symptomatic patients received antivirals and antibiotics more often. Antivirals studied were Oseltamivir (n=8414), Amantadine (n=319), Lopinavir-Ritonavir (n=100), Rimantadine (n=61), Zanamivir (n=39), and Acyclovir (n=36). Survival with antivirals (73.7%, P<.001) and antibiotics (85.8%, P<.001) was lower than no antiviral/antibiotic (93.6%) in the general population. Increased risk of death was observed with antivirals in ambulatory (HR=4.7, 95%CI:3.94-5.62) and non-critical (HR=2.03, 95%CI:1.86-2.21) patients; no benefit in hospitalized and critical patients. Oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality in the general population (HR=1.72, 95%CI:1.61-1.84), ambulatory (HR=4.79, 95%CI:4.01-5.75), non-critical (HR=2.05, 95%CI:1.88-2.23), and pregnancy (HR=8.35, 95%CI:1.77-39.30). Antibiotics were a protective factor in hospitalized (HR=0.81, 95%CI:0.77-0.86) and critical patients (HR=0.67, 95%CI:0.63-0.72), but a risk factor in the general population (HR=1.13, 95%CI:1.08-1.19) and children and adolescents (HR=4.22, 95%CI:2.01-8.86). In conclusion, oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality or no benefit in all groups. Common antivirals for COVID-19 should be avoided. Antibiotics may increase survival in hospitalized and critical patients. Vaccination history and rapid differentiation of etiologic agent will be key to promptly initiate or avoid antivirals during the COVID-19-influenza season.",Javier Mancilla-Galindo; Jorge Oscar Garcia-Mendez; Jessica Marquez-Sanchez; Rodrigo Estefano Reyes-Casarrubias; Eduardo Aguirre-Aguilar; Hector Isaac Rocha-Gonzalez; Ashuin Kammar-Garcia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211797,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211797,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

103,Funding and COVID-19 Research Priorities - Are the research needs for Africa being met?,"Introduction Emerging data from Africa indicates remarkably low numbers of reported COVID-19 deaths despite high levels of disease transmission. However evolution of these trends as the pandemic progresses remains unknown. More certain are the devastating long-term impacts of the pandemic on health and development evident globally. Research tailored to the unique needs of African countries is crucial. UKCDR and GloPID-R have launched a tracker of funded COVID-19 projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and research priorities of Africa and less-resourced countries and published a baseline analysis of a Living Systematic Review (LSR) of these projects. Methods In-depth analyses of the baseline LSR for COVID-19 funded research projects in Africa (as of 15th July 2020) to determine the funding landscape and alignment of the projects to research priorities of relevance to Africa. Results The limited COVID-19 related research across Africa appears to be supported mainly by international funding, especially from Europe, although with notably limited funding from United States-based funders. At the time of this analysis no research projects funded by an African-based funder were identified in the tracker although there are several active funding calls geared at research in Africa and there may be funding data which has not been made publicly available. Many projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and 5 particular gaps in research funding were identified namely: investigating the role of children in COVID-19 transmission; effective modes of community engagement; health systems research; communication of uncertainties surrounding mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19; and identifying ways to promote international cooperation. Capacity strengthening was identified as a dominant theme in funded research project plans.

104,Implementing a Telemedicine Curriculum for Internal Medicine Residents during a Pandemic: The Cleveland Clinic Experience,"Introduction Telemedicine is an important element of healthcare. However, until the COVID-19 pandemic, training in telemedicine was not a substantial element of most residency programs. Social distancing measures changed this. The Cleveland Clinic Internal Medicine Residency Program (IMRP) is one of the largest programs in the United States, which made the task of developing and adopting an effective, expedited telemedicine curriculum challenging. Our goal was to implement a system for teaching telemedicine care skills and supervising the care provided by residents during virtual visits. Study Design This study was started in April 2020. We developed and implemented a resident-led curriculum and training program for providing telemedicine care in less than five weeks. This entailed creating a formal training program for residents, creating a resource guide for the different video communication tools, and training preceptors to safely supervise care in this new paradigm. We also created an assessment instrument in our education evaluation system that allows residents to receive feedback on their performance during virtual appointments. Results Over 2000 virtual visits were performed by residents in a span of 10 weeks. Of 148 residents, 38% responded to the pre-participation survey. A majority had no prior telemedicine experience and expressed only slight comfort with the modality. Discussion Through collaboration with experienced residents and faculty, we expeditiously developed an enhancement to our ambulatory care curriculum to teach residents how to provide virtual care and help faculty with supervision.

105,Validation of a Derived International Patient Severity Phenotype to Support COVID-19 Analytics from Electronic Health Record Data,"Introduction. The Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) includes hundreds of hospitals internationally using a federated computational approach to COVID-19 research using the EHR. Objective. We sought to develop and validate a standard definition of COVID-19 severity from readily accessible EHR data across the Consortium. Methods. We developed an EHR-based severity algorithm and validated it on patient hospitalization data from 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also used a machine learning approach to compare selected predictors of severity to the 4CE algorithm at one site. Results. The 4CE severity algorithm performed with pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of single code categories for acuity were unacceptably inaccurate - varying by up to 0.65 across sites. A multivariate machine learning approach identified codes resulting in mean AUC 0.956 (95% CI: 0.952, 0.959) compared to 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921) using expert-derived codes. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with 49% precision and recall compared against chart review at one partner institution. Discussion. We developed a proxy measure of severity that proved resilient to coding variability internationally by using a set of 6 code classes. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may tend to overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed discrepancies even in the gold standard outcomes, possibly due to pandemic conditions. Conclusion.

Using data from the New York Times and the American Community Survey, we assess the effect of this return to campus on viral case growth in counties with a significant college student population (what we term college counties) relative to non-college counties. We find a significant surge of 9% in new cases in a 21-day time frame in college counties, a finding consistent across U.S. Census divisions. These results suggest the need for institutions of higher education and the communities where these institutions reside work together quickly and effectively to mitigate viral transmission and to prevent overwhelming local healthcare infrastructure in college counties.",Grace Bagwell Adams; Jerry Shannon; Sarah Shannon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212183,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212183,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
107,Preventing COVID-19 spread in closed facilities by regular testing of employees - an efficient intervention in long-term care facilities and prisons,"Background: Draconic control measures were introduced to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), where in parts of the US, accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. Methods and findings: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees in order to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group are investigated as well as the potential economic gain resulting from savings in COVID-19 related treatment costs in comparison to costs resulting from the testing interventions. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in the Federal Republic of Germany. The probability is nearly one that COVID-19 spreads into closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Regular screening of all employees by PCR tests provides a significant reduction of COVID-19 cases and related deaths in LTCFs. While the frequency of testing (testing rate) and the quality of tests have noticeable effects, the waiting time for obtaining test results (ranging from 12 up to 96 hours) hardly impacts the outcome. The results suggest that testing every two weeks with low-quality tests and a processing time of up to 96 hours yields a strong reduction in the number of cases. Rough estimates suggest a significant economic gain. Conclusions: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. These measures provide an economically meaningful way to protect vulnerable risk groups characterized by an elevated risk of severe infections in closed facilities, in which contact-reducing measures are difficult to implement due to imminent unavoidable close human-to-human contacts.",Henri Christian Junior Tsoungui Obama; Nessma Adil Mahmoud Yousif; Looli Hassan Mohamed Alawam Nemer; Pierre Marie Ngougoue Ngougoue; Gideon Akumah Ngwa; Miranda Teboh-Ewungkem; Kristan Schneider,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211573,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211573,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort SETTING: A total of 6 databases consisting of electronic medical records and claims data from France, Spain, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women with [&ge;] 1 year in contributing databases, diagnosed and/or tested positive, or hospitalized with COVID-19. The influenza cohort was derived from the 2017-2018 influenza season. OUTCOMES: Baseline patient characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms; 30-day inpatient drug utilization, maternal complications and pregnancy-related outcomes following diagnosis/hospitalization. RESULTS: 8,598 women diagnosed (2,031 hospitalized) with COVID-19 were included. Hospitalized women had, compared to those diagnosed, a higher prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities including renal impairment (2.2% diagnosed vs 5.1% hospitalized) and anemia (15.5% diagnosed vs 21.3% hospitalized). The ten most common inpatient treatments were systemic corticosteroids (29.6%), enoxaparin (24.0%), immunoglobulins (21.4%), famotidine (20.9%), azithromycin (18.1%), heparin (15.8%), ceftriaxone (7.9%), aspirin (7.0%), hydroxychloroquine (5.4%) and amoxicillin (3.5%). Compared to 27,510 women with influenza, dyspnea and anosmia were more prevalent in those with COVID-19. Women with COVID-19 had higher frequency of cesarean-section (4.4% vs 3.1%), preterm delivery (0.9% vs 0.5%), and poorer maternal outcomes: pneumonia (12.0% vs 2.7%), ARDS (4.0% vs 0.3%) and sepsis (2.1% vs 0.7%). COVID-19 fatality was negligible (N<5 in each database respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities that were more prevalent with COVID-19 hospitalization (compared to COVID-19 diagnosed) in pregnancy included renal impairment and anemia. Multiple medications were used to treat pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, some with little evidence of benefit. Anosmia and dyspnea were indicative symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnancy compared to influenza, and may aid differential diagnosis.

110,Persistent symptoms after Covid-19: qualitative study of 114 long Covid patients and draft quality criteria for services,"Background Approximately 10% of patients with Covid-19 experience symptoms beyond 3-4 weeks. Patients call this long Covid. We sought to document the lived experience of such patients, their accounts of accessing and receiving healthcare, and their ideas for improving services. Method We held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their personal stories and comment on other stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, the clinical relationship, access to care, and service redesign. Results The sample was 70% female, aged 27-73 years, and comprised White British (74%), Asian (11%), White Other (7%), Black (4%), and Mixed (4%). 27 were doctors and 23 other health professionals. Approximately 10% had been hospitalised. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others described feeling fobbed off); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotional touch points in participant experiences informed ideas for improving services. Conclusion Quality principles for a long Covid service should include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.",Emma Ladds; Alexander Rushforth; Sietse Wieringa; Sharon Taylor; Clare Rayner; Laiba Husain; Trisha Greenhalgh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211854,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211854,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
111,Systematic analysis of electronic health records identifies drugs reducing risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and severity,"BACKGROUND It may take months to years until drugs specifically designed to treat COVID-19 are available. Until then, it is crucial to identify whether existing medications could have a protective effect against severe disease. This is the objective of this large population study performed in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel. METHODS CHS centrally manages electronic health records (EHRs) including medication purchases for over 4.5 million members. Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess systematically which drugs affected the risk of COVID 19 hospitalization: in both cohorts, case patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; matched control patients were taken from the general population in the first cohort, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the second cohort. For each medication anatomical-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) class acquired during the last month before the index-date, we computed the odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95% confidence interval (CI), and the p value, using Fisher's exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS Several drugs and pharmacy sold items were associated with significantly reduced odds for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, notably ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95% CI [0.058,0.458], p<0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.513, 95% CI [0.375,0.688], P<0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.746, 95% CI [0.645,0.858], p<0.001) and flecainide (OR=0.303, 95% CI [0.080,0.813], p<0.01). Additionally, acquisition of surgical masks, latex gloves and several ophthalmological products were associated with decreased risk for hospitalization. CONCLUSION Ubiquinone, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway were associated with reduced hospitalization risk. These findings suggest a promising protective effect which should be further investigated.",Ariel Israel; Alejandro Schaffer; Assi Cicurel; Ilan Feldhamer; Ameer Tal; Kuoyuan Cheng; Sanju Sinha; Eyal Schiff; Gil Lavie; Eytan Ruppin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211953,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211953,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
112,"Less severe course of COVID-19 is associated with elevated levels of antibodies against seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 (HCoV OC43, HCoV HKU1)","The clinical course of COVID-19 is very heterogeneous: Most infected individuals can be managed in an outpatient setting, but a substantial proportion of patients requires intensive care, resulting in a high rate of fatalities. Recently, an association between contact to small children and mild course of COVID-19 was reported. We performed an observational study to assess the impact of previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses on COVID-19 severity. 60 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were included (age 30 - 82 years; 52 males, 8 females): 19 inpatients with critical disease, 16 inpatients with severe or moderate disease and 25 outpatients (age and gender matched to inpatients). Patients with critical disease had significantly lower levels of HCoV OC43- (p=0.016) and HCoV HKU1-specific (p=0.023) antibodies at the first encounter compared to other COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses might protect against a severe course of disease.

113,Prone positioning of non-intubated patients with COVID-19 - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Purpose: Several studies have reported adopting prone positioning (PP) in non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related hypoxaemic respiratory failure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of PP on oxygenation and clinical outcomes. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and COVID-19 living systematic review from December1st 2019 to July23rd 2020. We included studies that reported using PP in hypoxaemic, non-intubated adult COVID-19 patients. Primary outcome measure was the weighted mean difference (MD) in oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2 or SpO2) pre and post-PP. Results: Fifteen single arm observational studies reporting PP in 449 patients were included. Substantial heterogeneity was noted in terms of, location within hospital where PP was instituted, respiratory supports, frequency and duration of PP. Significant improvement in oxygenation was reported post-PP: PaO2/FiO2, (MD 37.6, 95%CI 18.8, 56.5); PaO2, , (MD 30.4 mmHg, 95%CI 10.9, 49.9); and SpO2, (MD 5.8%, 95%CI 3.7, 7.9). Patients with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 [&le;]150 experienced greater oxygenation improvements compared with those with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 >150 (MD 40.5, 95%CI -3.5, 84.6) vs. 37, 95%CI 17.1, 56.9). Respiratory rate decreased post-PP (MD -2.9, 95%CI -5.4, -0.4). Overall intubation and mortality rates were 21% (90/426) and 26% (101/390) respectively. No major adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Despite significant variability in frequency and duration of PP and respiratory supports, PP was associated with improvements in oxygenation parameters without any reported serious adverse events. Major limitation being lack of control arm and adjustment for confounders.

114,Healthcare workers with mild / asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection show T cell responses and neutralising antibodies after the first wave,"Studies of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 include characterisation of lethal, severe and mild cases. Understanding how long immunity lasts in people who have had mild or asymptomatic infection is crucial. Healthcare worker (HCW) cohorts exposed to and infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic are an invaluable resource to study this question. The UK COVIDsortium is a longitudinal, London hospital HCW cohort, followed from the time of UK lockdown; weekly PCR, serology and symptom diaries allowed capture of asymptomatic infection around the time of onset, so duration of immunity could be tracked. Here, we conduct a cross-sectional, case-control, sub-study of 136 HCW at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown, with 76 having had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 mild or asymptomatic infection. Neutralising antibodies (nAb) were present in 90% of infected HCW sampled after the first wave; titres, likely to correlate with functional protection, were present in 66% at 16-18 weeks. T cell responses tended to be lower in asymptomatic infected HCW than those reporting case-definition symptoms of COVID-19, while nAb titres were maintained irrespective of symptoms. T cell and antibody responses were discordant. HCW lacking nAb also showed undetectable T cells to Spike protein but had T cells of other specificities. Our findings suggest that the majority of HCW with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection carry nAb complemented by multi-specific T cell responses for at least 4 months after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Catherine J.

115,Epidemiologial Analysis of Patients Presenting to a West London District General Hospital Requiring Admission with Covid-19,"Background: Coronavirus has lead to significant morbidity and mortality both within the UK and worldwide. We hypothesise there are local clusters of coronavirus which would therefore be amenable to targeted public health measures. Methods: This is a retrospective, observational case series conducted in a West London District General Hospital. All patients admitted to hospital with a radiological or microbiological diagnosis of Covid-19 were included (children under 16 years were excluded). Consecutive sampling was used and baseline characteristics including age, sex, postcode and final patient outcome were collected from the electronic health records. Patient origin postcode was plotted to a map of the local area and an online cloud based mapping analysis system was used to generate heat maps and case density maps which were compared to living base layers. The primary outcome was identification of local clusters of cases of coronavirus. Secondary outcome was identification of population characteristics that may provide evidence for more targetted public health intervention in a second wave. Results: Local clusters of infection were identified within the target population. These appeared to correlate with higher indices of deprivation, poorer overall health and high household occupancy suggesting a role for public health measures to target these areas. Conclusion: There is a role for targeted public health measures in tackling the spread of coronavirus, paying particular attention to those who live in more deprived areas.",Eleanor Heald; Natalie Ring; Dinesh Vatvani; David Shackleton,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212126,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212126,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
116,Mathematical Perspective of Covid-19 Pandemic: Disease Extinction Criteria in Deterministic and Stochastic Models,"The world has been facing the biggest virological invasion in the form of Covid-19 pandemic since the beginning of the year 2020. In this paper, we consider a deterministic epidemic model of four compartments classified based on the health status of the populations of a given country to capture the disease progression. A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time basic reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period. Estimated cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases are 1,613,626 and 42,899, respectively, with case fatality rate 2.66 per cent till the deadly virus is eliminated from Spain.",Debadatta Adak; Abhijit Majumder; Nandadulal Bairagi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211201,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211201,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
117,A comparative study of infection and mortality in COVID-19 across countries: A scaling analysis,"Analysing infection and mortality data for COVID-19 as a function of days for 54 countries across all continents, we show that there is a simple scaling behaviour connecting these two quantities for any given nation when the data is segmented over few ranges of dates covering the most rapid spread of the pandemic and the recovery, wherever achieved. This scaling is described by two parameters, one representing a shift along the time axis and the other is a normalisation factor, providing a reliable definition of the mortality rate for each country in a given period. The number of segments for any country required in our analyses turns out to be surprisingly few with as many as 16 out of 54 countries being described by a single segment and no country requiring more than three segments. Estimates of the shift and mortality for these 54 countries in different periods show large spreads ranging over 0-16 days and 0.45-19.96%, respectively. Shift and mortality are found to be inversely correlated. Analyses of number of tests carried out for detecting COVID-19 and the number of infections detected due to such tests suggest that an effective way to increase the shift, and therefore, decrease mortality, is to increase number of tests per infection detected. This points to the need of a dynamic management of testing that should accelerate with the rise of the pandemic; it also suggests a basis for adjusting variations in the testing patterns in different geographical locations within a given country.",Ranjan Das; Akmal Hossain; Sayak Mandal; Debasmita Pariari; Rohit Kumar Rohj; Swapnil Shukla; Rahul Mahavir Varma; Dipankar Das Sarma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212175,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212175,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
118,School closures and SARS-CoV-2. Evidence from Sweden's partial school closure,"To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 most countries closed schools, despite uncertainty if school closures are an effective containment measure. At the onset of the pandemic, Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions. Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03-1.27]. Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52-2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00-1.68]. When analyzing COVID-19 diagnoses from healthcare visits and the incidence of severe health outcomes, results are similar for teachers but somewhat weaker for parents and teachers' partners. The results for parents indicate that keeping lower secondary schools open had minor consequences for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in society. The results for teachers suggest that measures to protect teachers could be considered.",Jonas Vlachos; Edvin Hertegard; Helena B Svaleryd,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211359,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211359,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
119,A delayed modulation of solar radiation on the COVID-19 transmission reflects an incubation period,"Laboratory experiments have revealed the meteorological sensitivity of the virus of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no consensus has been reached about how the meteorological conditions modulate the virus transmission as it is constrained more often by non-meteorological factors. Here, we find that the non-meteorological factors constrain statistically-least the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases in a country when the cases arrive around 2500-3000. The least-constrained growth rate correlates with the near-surface ultraviolet flux and temperature significantly (correlation coefficients r=-0.55{+/-}0.08 and -0.45{+/-}0.08 at p 10-5, respectively). In response to increases of 1W/m2 ultraviolet and 1{degrees}C temperature, the growth rate decreases by 0.33{+/-}.11% and 0.18{+/-}.08% per day, respectively. The response to the ultraviolet flux exhibits a delay by about 7 days, providing an independent measure of the incubation period.

A living systematic review,"ABSTRACT Background: It is of paramount importance to understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools, which could support the decision-making about educational facilities closure or re-opening with effective prevention and control measures in place. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. We performed risk of bias evaluation of all included studies using the Newcastle- Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: 2,178 articles were retrieved and 11 studies were included. Five cohort studies reported a combined 22 student and 21 staff index cases that exposed 3,345 contacts with 18 transmissions [overall infection attack rate (IAR): 0.08% (95% CI: 0.00%-0.86%)]. IARs for students and school staff were 0.15% (95% CI: 0.00%-0.93%) and 0.70% (95% CI: 0.00%-3.56%) respectively. Six cross-sectional studies reported 639 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 6,682 study participants tested [overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate: 8.00% (95% CI: 2.17%-16.95%)]. SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was estimated to be 8.74% (95% CI: 2.34%-18.53%) among students, compared to 13.68% (95% CI: 1.68%-33.89%) among school staff. Gender differences were not found for secondary infection (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.50-4.14, P= 0.49) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.72-1.13, P= 0.36) in schools. Fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, asthenia, and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (based on two studies). Overall, study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias, limiting the confidence in the results. Conclusions: There is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff.

122,"Precautionary breaks: planned, limited duration circuit breaks to control the prevalence of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (early March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days (growth rate r{approx}0.2). The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic quantities (r{approx}-0.06) that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed (r{approx}-0.02). Since August, infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been rising (precise estimation of the cur-rent growth rate is difficult due to extreme regional heterogeneity and temporal lags between the different epidemiological observations) and various NPIs have been applied locally throughout the UK in response. Controlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Currently, NPI imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such emergency NPIs are required. These 'precautionary breaks' may offer a means of keeping control of the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their society impact. Here, using simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the unfolding UK epidemic, we investigate the action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of infection, as well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths. We find that precautionary breaks provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures (such as contact tracing)to regain control.",Matt J Keeling; Glen Guyver-Fletcher; Alexander Holmes; Louise J Dyson; Michael Tildesley; Edward M Hill; Graham F Medley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211813,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211813,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
123,Nonspecific blood tests as proxies for COVID-19 hospitalization: are there plausible associations after excluding noisy predictors?,"This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.",Gerson Ishikawa; Graziela Argenti; Cristina Berger Fadel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211557,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211557,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

During this period, children and their families were exposed to a full-time home life. The aim of this study was to assess the emotional experience and tolerance of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in this particular context. Method: A clinical survey was proposed to parents and rated by professionals once a week during the quarantine period in France. 95 autistic children followed by the child and adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital were assessed from the 18th of March to the 8th of May. The following clinical points were investigated: child anxiety, family anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on appetite, impact on school work, family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to follow a schedule, isolation behavior. Results: Despite minor changes in family anxiety and school work, no difference was highlighted between clinical scores collected at the beginning and at the end of this period. ASD children with or without intellectual disability had non-significant clinical changes during quarantine. This evolution was also independent of the accommodation type (house or apartment) and the parental status (relationship, separated or isolated). Conclusion: The sameness dimension in autism and parents adaptation may be involved in this clinical stability during COVID confinement.

125,Circulating Proteins Influencing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: a Mendelian Randomization Study,"Proteins detectable in peripheral blood may influence COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. However, understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be influenced by COVID-19 itself and also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and reduces bias due to confounding and reverse causation. We began by identifying the genetic determinants of 955 circulating proteins in up to 10,708 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide polymorphisms near the gene encoded by the circulating protein. We then undertook an MR study to estimate the effect of these proteins on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the Host Genetics Initiative. We found that a standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 2,972 cases / 284,472 controls; OR = 0.48, P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,492 / 1,012,809; OR = 0.60, P = 2x10-7) and COVID-19 susceptibility (N = 17,607 / 1,345,334; OR = 0.81, P = 6x10-5). Results were consistent despite multiple sensitivity analyses probing MR assumptions. OAS1 is an interferon-stimulated gene that promotes viral RNA degradation. Other potentially implicated proteins included IL10RB. Available medicines, such as interferon-beta-1b, increase OAS1 and could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.",Sirui Zhou; Guillaume Butler-Laporte; Tomoko Nakanishi; David Morrison; Jonathan Afilalo; Marc Afilalo; Nofar Kimchi; Zaman Afrasiabi; Nardin Rezk; Meriem Bouab; Charlotte Guzman; Louis Petitjean; Xioaqing Xue; Christos Tselios; Branka Vulesevic; Yiheng Chen; Vincent Mooser; Vincenzo Forgetta; Daniel Kaufmann; Brent Richards,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212092,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212092,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

In severe COVID-19 illness, there is significant up-regulation of complement and coagulation pathway, and negative correlation between NETosis and respiratory function (oxygen saturation). Interestingly, there is an early spike in the level of IL-6 gene expression in severe illness compared to moderate illness. With passing days post-onset, the level of IL-6 expression in severe illness approaches that in moderate illness. The data are consistent with IL-6 acting as a driver of NETosis in the early phase of severe COVID-19 illness, that results in a vicious cycle of NETosis-complement/coagulation-respiratory dysfunction. This has important consequence for timing of rational therapy with anti-IL-6 and NETosis inhibitors in severe COVID-19 illness.",Samanwoy Mukhopadhyay; Subrata Sinha; Saroj Kant Mohapatra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211425,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211425,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
127,Virus detection and identification in minutes using single-particle imaging and deep learning,"The increasing frequency and magnitude of viral outbreaks in recent decades, epitomized by the current COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in an urgent need for rapid and sensitive viral diagnostic methods. Here, we present a methodology for virus detection and identification that uses a convolutional neural network to distinguish between microscopy images of single intact particles of different viruses. Our assay achieves labeling, imaging and virus identification in less than five minutes and does not require any lysis, purification or amplification steps. The trained neural network was able to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from negative clinical samples, as well as from other common respiratory pathogens such as influenza and seasonal human coronaviruses, with high accuracy. Single-particle imaging combined with deep learning offers a promising alternative to traditional viral diagnostic methods, and has the potential for significant impact.",Nicolas Shiaelis; Alexander Tometzki; Leon Peto; Andrew McMahon; Christof Hepp; Erica Bickerton; Cyril Favard; Delphine Muriaux; Monique Andersson; Sarah Oakley; Alison Vaughan; Philippa C Matthews; Nicole Stoesser; Derrick Crook; Achillefs N Kapanidis; Nicole C Robb,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212035,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212035,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

Although the current gold standard involves testing of nasopharyngeal swabs specimens by nucleic acid amplification test, such as real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it presents several limitations that ultimately may translate into a bottleneck in the surveillance regimen. New strategies based on frequent testing using less invasive specimens are urgently needed for containment of the infection.

129,Innate lymphoid cell composition associates with COVID-19 disease severity,"Objectives: The role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unknown. Understanding the immune response in COVID-19 could contribute to unravel the pathogenesis and identification of treatment targets. To describe the phenotypic landscape of circulating ILCs in COVID-19 patients and to identify ILC phenotypes correlated to serum biomarkers, clinical markers, and laboratory parameters relevant in COVID-19. Methods: Blood samples collected from moderately (n=11) and severely ill (n=12) COVID-19 patients as well as healthy control donors (n=16), were analyzed with 18-parameter flow cytometry. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we examined the ILC activation status and homing profile. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained from all COVID-19 patients and serum biomarkers were analyzed with multiplex immunoassays. Results: ILCs were largely depleted from the circulation of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and ILCp, and ILC1, respectively. The activated ILC profile of COVID-19 patients was associated with soluble inflammatory markers, while frequencies of ILC subsets were correlated with laboratory parameters that reflect the disease severity. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the potential role of ILCs in immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, particularly linked to the severity of COVID-19.",Marina Garcia; Efthymia Kokkinou; Anna Carrasco Garcia; Tiphaine Parrot; Laura M.

130,Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on People with Hypertension,"Objectives: It is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are needed. Design: This retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions. Methods: Baseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender, education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions, prevention intentions and anxiety were measured. Results: At baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%). Conclusions: Anxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.",Carissa Bonner; Erin Cvejic; Julie Ayre; Jennifer Isautier; Christopher Semsarian; Brooke Nickel; Carys Batcup; Kristen Pickles; Rachael Dodd; Samuel Cornell; Tessa Copp; Kirsten J McCaffery,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
131,Frontline healthcare workers' experiences with personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a rapid qualitative appraisal,"Objectives To report frontline healthcare workers' (HCWs) experiences with personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. To understand HCWs' fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145,000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). HCWs interviewed were from secondary care, primary care and specialist community clinics. Media and policy data were from across the UK. Results A major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national-level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to re-use and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about inequitable access to PPE for community, lower seniority, female and ethnic minority HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use. Conclusion This study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use, as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance.

134,Post mortem pathological findings in COVID-19 cases: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is considered one of the most serious public health crisis over the last few decades. Although the disease can result in diverse, multiorgan pathology, there have been very few studies addressing the postmortem pathological findings of the cases. Active autopsy amid this pandemic could be an essential tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and research. Objective: To provide a total picture of the SARS-CoV-2 histopathological features of different body organs in postmortem autopsies through a systematic search of the published literature. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google scholar, Medrxiv & Biorxiv) was carried out from December 2019 to August, 15th 2020, for journal articles of different study designs reporting postmortem pathological findings in COVID-19 cases. PRISMA guidelines were used for reporting the review. Results: A total of 50 articles reporting 430 cases were included in our analysis. Postmortem pathological findings were reported for different body organs, pulmonary system (42 articles), cardiovascular system ( 23 articles), hepatobiliary system (22 articles), kidney (16 articles), spleen, and lymph nodes (12 articles), and central nervous system (7 articles). In lung samples, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most commonly reported findings in 239 cases (84.4%). Myocardial hypertrophy (87 cases by 51.2%), arteriosclerosis (121 cases by 62%), and steatosis ( 118 cases by 59.3%) were the most commonly reported pathological findings in the heart, kidney, and hepatobiliary system respectively. Conclusion: Autopsy examination as an investigation tool could help in a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and subsequently improving patient care.

135,"Coronavirus Disease-2019 Case, Death, and Testing Rates in the United States and Worldwide: Primary Data and Review","ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with a world-wide pandemic, with the United States (US) having the largest total number of cases and deaths (>7 million and >200,000, respectively) at this time. We assessed data as of September 1, 2020 from our combined laboratories and as reported for selected states and countries for case, death, and testing rates per 1 million in the population. Our goal was to elucidate potential causes for the large rate differences observed. SARS-CoV-2 naso-pharyngeal (NP) RNA swab testing in 985,219 US subjects referred to our laboratories by healthcare providers revealed an overall 10.1% positive rate, comparable to the 7.3% rate reported nationwide. In a small subset of 91 subjects, all of whom had been positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP swabs 2-4 weeks earlier, NP swab testing was twice as likely to be positive (58.6%) as saliva samples (21.5%), based on paired sampling. Our positive rates per state agreed reasonably well with reported Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data (r=0.609, P<0.0001) based on 19,898 cases, 593 deaths, and 271,637 tests, all per 1 million in the US population. Louisiana had the highest case rate; New Jersey had the highest death rate; and Rhode Island had the highest testing rate. Of 47 countries, including all countries with populations >50 million, Qatar had the highest case rate; Peru had the highest death rate; and Israel had the highest testing rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Correlations between case rates and death rates as well as testing rates were 0.473 and 0.398 for US states and 0.473 and 0.476 for the various countries, respectively (all P<0.0001). In conclusion, outpatient saliva testing is not as sensitive as NP testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

Of greatest interest is the ~300 amino acid receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit of the spike protein because of its key interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor present on many cell types, especially lung epithelial cells. We report here the development and functional characterization of 29 nanomolar-affinity mouse SARS-CoV-2 mAbs created by an accelerated immunization and hybridoma screening process.

137,Therapeutic activity of an inhaled potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibody in hamsters,"SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract, enabling transmission and often leading to substantial lung pathology. Delivering the antiviral treatment directly to the lungs has the potential to improve lung bioavailability and dosing efficiency. As the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) is increasingly deemed to be a clinically validated target, RBD-specific B cells were isolated from patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection to derive a panel of fully human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The most potent hmAb, 1212C2 was derived from an IgM memory B cell, has high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD which enables its direct inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2. The 1212C2 hmAb exhibits in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters when delivered intraperitoneally, achieving a meaningful reduction in upper and lower respiratory viral burden and lung pathology. Furthermore, liquid nebulized inhale treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters with as low as 0.6 mg/kg of inhaled dose, corresponding to approximately 0.03 mg/kg of lung deposited dose, mediated a reduction in respiratory viral burden that is below the detection limit, and mitigated lung pathology. The therapeutic efficacy achieved at an exceedingly low-dose of inhaled 1212C2 supports the rationale for local lung delivery and achieving dose-sparing benefits as compared to the conventional parenteral route of administration. Taken together, these results warrant an accelerated clinical development of 1212C2 hmAb formulated and delivered via inhalation for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Michael S Piepenbrink; Jun-Gyu Park; Fatai Oladunni; Ashlesha Deshpande; Madhubanti Basu; Sanghita Sarkar; Andreas Loos; Jennifer Woo; Phillip Lovalenti; Derek Sloan; Chengjin Ye; Kevin Chiem; Nathaniel B Erdmann; Paul A Goepfert; Vu L Truong; Mark R Walter; Luis Martinez-Sobrido; James J Kobie,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339150,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339150,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False

Through experimental co-infection of IAV with either pseudotyped or SARS-CoV-2 live virus, we found that IAV pre-infection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types. Remarkably, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice co-infected with IAV in vivo. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not seen with several other viruses probably due to a unique IAV segment as an inducer to elevate ACE2 expression.

Although viral RNA modification has been reported based on the transcriptome architecture, the types and functions of RNA modification are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in SARS-CoV-2. Our methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m6A modification. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection not only increased the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) but also altered its distribution. Modification of METTL3 expression by short hairpin RNA or plasmid transfection for knockdown or overexpression, respectively, affected viral replication. Furthermore, the viral key protein RdRp interacted with METTL3, and METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the presence of RdRp.

142,"ACIS, A Novel KepTide™, Binds to ACE-2 Receptor and Inhibits the Infection of SARS-CoV2 Virus in vitro in Primate Kidney Cells: Therapeutic Implications for COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a virus known as SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Without a targeted-medicine, this disease has been causing a massive humanitarian crisis not only in terms of mortality, but also imposing a lasting damage to social life and economic progress of humankind. Therefore, an immediate therapeutic strategy needs to be intervened to mitigate this global crisis. Here, we report a novel KepTide (Knock-End Peptide) therapy that nullifies SARS-CoV2 infection. SARS-CoV2 employs its surface glycoprotein ""spike"" (S-glycoprotein) to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its infection in host cells. Based on our in-silico-based homology modeling study validated with a recent X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB ID:6M0J), we have identified that a conserved motif of S-glycoprotein that intimately engages multiple hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions with ACE-2 enzyme. Accordingly, we designed a peptide, termed as ACIS (ACE-2 Inhibitory motif of Spike), that displayed significant affinity towards ACE-2 enzyme as confirmed by biochemical assays such as BLItz and fluorescence polarization assays. Interestingly, more than one biochemical modifications were adopted in ACIS in order to enhance the inhibitory action of ACIS and hence called as KEpTide. Consequently, a monolayer invasion assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that KEpTide efficiently mitigated the infection of SARS-CoV2 in vitro in VERO E6 cells. Finally, evaluating the relative abundance of ACIS in lungs and the potential side-effects in vivo in mice, our current study discovers a novel KepTide therapy that is safe, stable, and robust to attenuate the infection of SARS-CoV2 virus if administered intranasally.",Avik Roy; Gunnar Gottschalk; Konstance Knox; Chi Hao Luan; Jim Keating; Kris Kesler,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337584,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337584,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False

144,Structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 degrades with temperature,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.

Statement of Scientific SignificanceThe economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are very significant. However scientific information needed to underpin policy decisions are limited partly due to novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. There is therefore an urgent need for mechanistic studies of both COVID-19 disease and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

145,"Obesity alters Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in lung, trachea, and esophagus in a sex-dependent manner: Implications for COVID-19","Obesity is a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. The underlying basis of this association is likely complex in nature. The host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for viral cell entry. It is unclear whether obesity alters expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in the lower respiratory tract. Here, we show that: 1) Ace2 expression is elevated in the lung and trachea of diet-induced obese male mice and reduced in the esophagus of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 2) Tmprss2 expression is increased in the trachea of obese male mice but reduced in the lung and elevated in the trachea of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 3) in chow-fed lean mice, females have higher expression of Ace2 in the lung and esophagus as well as higher Tmprss2 expression in the lung but lower expression in the trachea compared to males; and 4) in diet-induced obese mice, males have higher expression of Ace2 in the trachea and higher expression of Tmprss2 in the lung compared to females, whereas females have higher expression of Tmprss2 in the trachea relative to males. Our data indicate diet- and sex-dependent modulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in the lower respiratory tract and esophagus. Given the high prevalence of obesity worldwide and a sex-biased mortality rate, we discuss the implications and relevance of our results for COVID-19.",Dylan C Sarver; G.

146,Immunogenicity of novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine MRT5500 in mice and non-human primates,"An effective vaccine to address the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an urgent public health priority1. Novel synthetic mRNA and vector-based vaccine technologies offer an expeditious development path alternative to traditional vaccine approaches. Here we describe the efforts to utilize an mRNA platform for rational design and evaluations of mRNA vaccine candidates based on Spike (S) glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Several mRNA constructs expressing various structural conformations of S-protein, including wild type (WT), a pre-fusion stabilized mutant (2P), a furin cleavage-site mutant (GSAS) and a double mutant form (2P/GSAS), were tested in a preclinical animal model for their capacity to elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). The lead 2P/GSAS candidate was further assessed in dose-ranging studies in mice and Cynomolgus macaques. The selected 2P/GSAS vaccine formulation, now designated MRT5500, elicited potent nAbs as measured in two types of neutralization assays. In addition, MRT5500 elicited TH1-biased responses in both mouse and non-human primate species, a result that helps to address a hypothetical concern regarding potential vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases associated with TH2-biased responses. These data position MRT5500 as a viable vaccine candidate for clinical development against COVID-19.",Kirill V Kalnin; Timothy Plitnik; Michael Kishko; Jinrong Zhang; Donghui Zhang; Andrien Beauvais; Natalie G Anosova; Timothy Tibbitts; Joshua M DiNapoli; Po-Wei D Huang; James Huleatt; Deanne Vincent; Katherine Fries; Shrirang Karve; Rebecca Goldman; Hardip Gopani; Anusha Dias; Khang Tran; Minnie Zacharia; Xiaobo Gu; Lianne Boeglin; Sudha Chivukula; Ron Swearingen; Victoria Landolfi; Tong-Ming Fu; Frank DeRosa; Danilo Casimiro,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.337535,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.337535,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False
147,The viral protein NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper for shutting down host translation and fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine  Achille heel of the virus.",Antonin Tidu; Aurelie Janvier; Laure Schaeffer; Piotr Sosnowski; Lauriane Kuhn; Philippe Hammann; Eric Westhof; Gilbert Eriani; Franck Martin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339515,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339515,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False
148,Use of convalescent serum reduces severity of COVID-19 in nonhuman primates,"Passive transfer of convalescent plasma or serum is a time-honored strategy for treating infectious diseases. Human convalescent plasma containing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is currently being used to treat COVID-19 patients. However, most patients have been treated outside of randomized clinical trials making it difficult to determine the efficacy of this approach. Here, we assessed the efficacy of convalescent sera in a newly developed African green monkey model of COVID-19. Groups of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals were treated with pooled convalescent sera containing either high or low to moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Differences in viral load and disease pathology were minimal between monkeys that received the lower titer convalescent sera and untreated controls. However, and importantly, lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory compartments, reduced gross and histopathological lesion severity in the lungs, and reductions in several parameters associated with coagulation and inflammatory processes were observed in monkeys that received convalescent sera versus untreated controls. Our data support human studies suggesting that convalescent plasma therapy is an effective strategy if donors with high level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are employed and if recipients are at an early stage of disease.",robert cross; Abhishek N Prasad; Viktoriya Borisevich; Courtney Woolsey; Krystle N Agans; Daniel J.

149,Associations between governor political affiliation and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States,"IntroductionAs the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly politicized in the United States (US), political party affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. We examined differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates stratified by governor party affiliation across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC).

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal analysis examining daily COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 to September 30, 2020, for each US state and DC. We fit a Bayesian negative binomial model to estimate adjusted daily risk ratios (RRs) and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing infection and death rates by gubernatorial (mayoral for DC) party affiliation. We adjusted for several state-level variables, including population density, age, race, poverty, and health.

ResultsFrom March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had, on average, lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. However, on June 8, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher per capita COVID-19 incidence rates (RR=1.15, 95% PI: 1.02, 1.25). This trend persisted until September 30 (RR=1.26, 95% PI: 0.96, 1.51). For death rates, Republican-led states had lower average rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 13 (RR=1.22, 95% PI: 1.03,1.37) to September 30 (RR=1.74, 95% PI: 1.20, 2.24).

150,"Findings from serological surveys (in August 2020) to assess the exposure of adult population to SARS Cov-2 infection in three cities of Odisha, India.","BackgroundThere is always an uncertainty of epidemiological, serological infectivity and virulence of the emerging novel coronavirus. Antibody test can be used for assessing whether immunity has developed in the infected person after 5-7 days of illness and understand cumulative exposure levels to the infection, make inferences on the actual burden of infection, its geographical spread, effect on specific demographic/risk groups, gaps in testing and infection fatality rates.

ObjectiveTo estimate and compare the sero-prevalence, hidden prevalence and determine the demographic risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in three largest cities of Odisha, India.

MethodologyThis was a population based cross sectional serological survey carried out in August 2020 in the three largest cities of the state of Odisha. Sample size per city was estimated to be 1500 and participants were enrolled from the community using multi-stage random sampling from 25 clusters from each city. Data was collected using ODK based tools by household visits and 3-4 ml of blood samples were collected after informed consent. Samples were transported to testing lab where Serum was separated and tested for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies using automated CLIA platform. Statistical analysis was done using R-software packages.

ResultsA total of 4146 participants from the 3 cities of Bhubaneswar (BBS), Berhampur (BAM) and Rourkela (RKL) participated. A total of 5635 households were approached and the average non response rate in the community was 17.4%. The gender weighted seroprevalence across the three cities was 20.78% (95% CI: 19.56%-22.05%). Seroprevalence was highest in BAM at 31.14% (95% CI: 28.69-33.66%) followed by 24.59% (95% CI: 22.39-26.88%) in RKL and 5.24% (95% CI: 4.10-6.58%) in BBS. While females reported a higher seroprevalence (22.8%) as compared to males (18.8%), there was no significant difference in seroprevalence across age groups. A majority of the seropositive participants were asymptomatic (93.87%). Among those who reported symptoms, the most common symptom was fever (68.89%) followed by cough (46.06%) and myalgia (32.67%). The case to infection ratio on the date of serosurvey was 1: 6.6 in BBS, 1:61 in BAM and 1:29.8 in RKL.

151,SARS-CoV-2 waves in Europe: A 2-stratum SEIRS model solution,"In order to design actionable SARS-CoV-2 strategies, we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable individuals. At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform, showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns. Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer non-uniform isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the <60 to >60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 43%; Catalonia 24%; Brussels 73%; and Stockholm 65%) are closer to reality. In locations where we didnt find reliable serology, we performed immunity estimations assuming Spains serology ratio (Paris: 24%; London: 34%). We predict that, with the exception of Brussels, no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller one). For locations far from the herd immunity threshold (HIT) we searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths, shockingly all found isolations for healthy <60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final deaths). Then, assuming an ideal 1-day long vaccination campaign with a 77% efficacy vaccine, we compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180-day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy <60 and results in 0.65 isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy <60 (i.e. schools and workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: March 7 2021; Catalonia: Dec 26 2020; Paris: Jan 12 2021; London: Jan 25 2021).

152,Estimating COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on-stream through phone-calls,"One of the main problems in controlling COVID-19 epidemic spread is the delay in confirming cases. Having information on changes in the epidemic evolution or outbreaks rise before lab-confirmation is crucial in decision making for Public Health policies. We present an algorithm to estimate on-stream the number of COVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line. By modeling the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with coefficient of determination R2 > 0.85. This result allows us to estimate the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days before the lab results are available. We validate the algorithm with real data. We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance to lab results. One key point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a main indicator to detect an anomaly. We present the details of the explicit example in Villa Azul (Quilmes) where this tool resulted crucial to control an outbreak on time.

153,Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with learning disabilities: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to July 2020,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a widespread impact on mental healthcare service provision and use. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemics first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with learning disabilities across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st July 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with learning disabilities. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with learning disabilities over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March (or a 282% increase if the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was considered alone).",Evangelia Martin; Eleanor Nuzum; Matthew Broadbent; Robert Stewart,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
154,EVALUATION OF ELEVEN IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHIC ASSAYS FOR SARS-CoV-2 DETECTION: INVESTIGATING DENGUE CROSS-REACTION,"BackgroundCOVID-19 disease (Coronavirus disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is widespread worldwide, affecting more than 11 million people globally (July 6th, 2020). Diagnostic techniques have been studied in order to contain the pandemic. Immunochromatographic (IC) assays are feasible and low cost alternative for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the population.

MethodsHere we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of eleven different immunochromatographic tests in 98 serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 through RT-PCR and 100 negative serum samples from blood donors collected in February 2019. Considering the endemic situation of Dengue in Brazil, we also evaluated the cross-reactivity with Dengue using 20 serum samples from patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue collected in early 2019 through four different tests.

ResultsOur results demonstrated agreement between immunochromatographic assays and RT-PCR, especially after 10 days since the onset of symptoms. The evaluation of IgG and IgM antibodies combined demonstrated a strong level of agreement (0.85) of IC assays and RT-PCR. It was observed cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 using four different IC assays for COVID-19 diagnosis. The specificity of IC assays to detected COVID-19 IgM antibodies using Dengue serum samples varied from 80% to 85%; the specificity of IgG detection was 100% and total antibody was 95%.

ConclusionsWe found high sensitivity, specificity and good agreement of IC assays, especially after 10 days onset of symptoms. However, we detected cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 mainly with IgM antibodies demonstrating the need for better studies about diagnostic techniques for these diseases.

MethodsWe performed a literature search of clinical trials, cohorts, and case series using PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library, and downloadable database of CDC. We excluded case reports and searched all-language articles for review and repeated until the final drafting. The search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database.

ResultsThirty studies with urinary sampling for viral shedding were included. A total number of 1,271 patients were enrolled initially, among which 569 patients had undergone urinary testing. Nine studies observed urinary viral shedding in urine from 41 patients. The total incidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%, compared to 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood and stool, respectively. The summarized risk ratio (RR) estimates for urine positive rates compared to the pharyngeal rate was 0.08. The pertaining RR urine compared to blood and stool positive rates were 0.20 and 0.33 respectively.

ConclusionsOur review concludes that not only the SARS-CoV-2 can be excreted in the urine in eight percent of patients but also its incidence may have associations with the severity of the systemic disease, ICU admission, and fatality rates. Moreover, the findings in our review suggest that a larger population size may reveal more positive urinary cases possibly by minimizing biases.

158,Extracorporeal Blood Purification in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients: a prospective cohort study,"Introduction: COVID-19 is characterised by hyperinflammation and coagulopathy. Severe cases often develop respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and critical cases progressing to ARDS. Control of hyperinflammation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic avenue for COVID-19; extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modalities offer an attractive mean to ameliorate maladaptive inflammation. With this work, we describe the longitudinal variation of parameters of systemic inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with blood purification using AN69ST (oXiris) hemodiafilter. Methods: We performed a time-series analysis of 44 consecutive COVID-19 cases treated with the AN69ST (oXiris) cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter; we visualise longitudinal results of biochemical, inflammatory, blood gas- and vital sign parameters. Results: Blood purification was indicated for suspected hyperinflammation or hypercoagulation, (= CRP > 100 mg/L and/or IL-6 > 40 pg/mL and/or Ferritin > 500 ng/mL and/or Lactate Dehydrogenase > 365 U/L or D-dimers > 2000 ng/mL). All patients were treated with at least 1 cycle extracorporeal continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVHF) with cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter (CAH); of these, 30 severe patients received CVVHF-CAH within 4 - 12 hours of hospitalisation. Another 14 patients admitted with mild-to-moderate symptoms progressed to severe disease and placed on EBP during the course of hospitalisation. The treatment was associated with a reduction of Ferritin, C-reactive protein, Fibrinogen, several inflammatory markers and a resolution of numerous cytopenias. The observed mortality across the cohort was 36.3% across the cohort. Conclusion: Extracorporeal blood purification with cytokine adsorbing hemofilter was associated with a decrease in the acute phase proteins CRP, Ferritin, and resolution of numerous cytopenias.

Hence, this study assessed the maternal health care services utilization in the amid of the COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia. Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interview using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables. A P-value of <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. The prevalence of maternal health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.8%. The odds of maternal health service utilization was higher among mothers who had primary (AOR=2.16, 95%CI: 1.29-3.60), secondary (AOR=1.97, 95%CI: 1.13-3.44), and college and above education (AOR=2.89, 95%CI: 1.34-6.22) than those who could not read and write. In addition, mothers who did travel 25-74 km (AOR= 0.37, 95%CI: 0.23-0.59) and 75-99 km (AOR= 0.10, 95%CI: 0.05-0.19) to reach health facility had a lower odds of maternal health service utilization than those who did travel < 24 km. Moreover, mothers who earn 1000-2000 (AOR= 3.10, 95%CI: 1.73-5.55) and > 2000 birr (AOR=2.66 95%CI: 1.52-4.64) had higher odds of maternal health service utilization than those who earn <500 birr. Similarly, the odds of utilizing maternal health service were higher among mothers who did not fear COVID-19 infection (AOR= 2.79, 95%CI: 1.85-4.20), who had not had to request permission from husband to visit the health facility (AOR= 7.24, 95%CI: 2.65-19.75), who had practiced COVID-19 prevention measure (AOR=5.82, 95%CI: 3.87-8.75), and used face mask (AOR= 2.06, 95% CI: 1.28-3.31) than their counterpart.

160,Duration of Oxygen Requirement and Predictors in Severe COVID-19 Patients in Ethiopia: A Survival Analysis,"AimTo estimate time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and identify predictors among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodsA prospective observational study was conducted among 244 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients from July to September, 2020. Frequency tables, KM plots, median survival times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to assess the presence of a statistically significant association between time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and the independent variables, where hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsMedian time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among the studied population was 6 days. Factors that affect time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy were age group (HR= 0.522, 95% CI= 0.323, 0.844, p-value=0.008 for [&ge;] 70 years) and shortness of breath (HR= 0.705, 95% CI= 0.519, 0.959, p-value=0.026).

ConclusionsAverage duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19 patients was 6 days and being 70 years and older and having shortness of breath were found to be associated with prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement. This result can be used as a guide in planning institutional resource allocation and patient management to provide a well equipped care to prevent complications and death from the disease.",Tigist W Leulseged; Ishmael S Hassen; Mesay G Edo; Daniel S Abebe; Endalkachew H Maru; Wuletaw C Zewde; Nigat W Chamesew; Tarik B Jagema,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209122,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209122,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

162,COVID-19 trends in Colombian regions with the highest disease burden,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic is currently the most significant global public health challenge, with more than 31 million cases reported to date. Colombia first reported COVID-19 cases in the country by early March 2020, and six months later it has reached ~750,471 clinical cases, with significant regional differences in morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization rates. Aims: Identify population characteristics and hospital capacity in the 13 municipalities with the highest disease notification and examine differences in cumulative reported cases, hospitalization, and mortality rates that may explain the regional differences. Materials and methods: A multi-group ecological study was performed based on the information available from public databases. Notification of cases, hospitalization, and crude mortality and age-adjusted rates were calculated. Results: The municipalities with the highest COVID-1 burden at different times during the study period displayed significant differences in population density and the proportion of elderly inhabitants, indigenous and afro descendants minorities; indices of unsatisfied basic needs and multidimensional poverty index, as well as the number of hospital beds. Likewise, essential variations in notification rates, hospitalization, and mortality were observed. The highest age-adjusted of reported cases (4,219 cases) and mortality (230.4 cases) rates were found in Leticia, the lowest general hospitalization rates in Buenaventura (37.5 cases) and the lowest ICU hospitalization rates (0) in Leticia and Tumaco due to a lack of these units in these municipalities. Conclusion: The probability of getting sick, hospitalized, and dying from COVID-19 appeared closely related to socio-economic, ethnic, and cultural characteristics, and also to hospital bed capacity.",Pablo Chaparro Sr.; Helmer Zapata Sr.; ISABEL HURTADO; ALBERTO ALZATE Sr.; MARIA CRISTINA LESMES; SOCRATES HERRERA Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210187,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210187,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
163,"Using an Agent-Based Model to Assess K-12 School Re-openings Under Different COVID-19 Spread Scenarios - United States, School Year 2020/21","School-age children play a key role in the spread of airborne viruses like influenza due to the prolonged and close contacts they have in school settings. As a result, school closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions were recommended as the first line of defense in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Assessing school reopening scenarios is a priority for states, administrators, parents, and children in order to balance educational disparities and negative population impacts of COVID-19. To address this challenge, we used an agent-based model that simulates communities across the United States including daycares, primary, and secondary schools to quantify the relative health outcomes of reopening schools. We explored different reopening scenarios including remote learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student population into cohorts (i.e., split cohort) in order to reduce exposure and disease spread. In addition, we assessed the combined impact of reduced in-person attendance in workplaces (e.g., through differing degrees of reliance on telework and/or temporary workplace closings) and school reopening scenarios to quantify the potential impact of additional transmission pathways contributing to COVID-19 spread. Scenarios where split cohorts of students return to school in non-overlapping formats resulted in significant decreases in the clinical attack rate (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic individuals), potentially by as much as 75% . These split cohort scenarios have impacts which are only modestly lesser than the most impactful 100% distance learning scenario. Split cohort scenarios can also significantly avert the number of cases--approximately 60M and 28M--depending on the scenario, at the national scale over the simulated eight-month period. We found the results of our simulations to be highly dependent on the number of workplaces assumed to be open for in-person business, as well as the initial level of COVID-19 incidence within the simulated community. Our results show that reducing the number of students attending school leads to better health outcomes, and the split cohort option enables part-time in-classroom education while substantially reducing risk. The results of this study can support decisions regarding optimal school reopening strategies that at the population level balance education and the negative health outcomes of COVID-19.",Timothy C.

164,Mathematical Modeling of COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent,"The present work aims to give a contribution to the understanding of the highly infectious pandemic caused by the COVID-19 in the African continent. The study focuses on the modelling and the forecasting of COVID-19 spread in the most affected African continent, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and South Africa and for the sake of comparison two of the most affected European country are also considered, namely: France and Italy. To this end, an epidemiological SEIQRDP model is presented, which is an adaptation of the classic SIR model widely used in mathematical epidemiology. In order to better coincide with the preventive measures taken by the governments to deal with the spread of COVID-19, this model considers the quarantine. For the identification of the models parameters, official data of the pandemic up to August 1st, 2020 are considered. The results show that the number of infections due to the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided the isolation is effective. However, it is increasing in some countries with the early lifting of containment. Finally, the information provided by the SEIQRDP model could help to establish a realistic assessment of the short-term pandemic situation. Moreover, this will help maintain the most appropriate and necessary public health measures after the lockdown lifting.",Nawel ARIES; Houdayfa OUNIS,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20210427,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20210427,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
165,"Robust test and trace strategies can prevent COVID-19 resurgences: a case study from New South Wales, Australia","Background: The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. In this study, we examine the Australian state of New South Wales, a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage, and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. We investigate how vulnerable the state would be to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing, and mask usage. Methods: We use a stochastic agent-based model, calibrated to the New South Wales epidemic and policy environment, to simulate possible epidemic outcomes over October 1 to December 31, 2020, under a range of assumptions about contact tracing efficacy, testing rates, and mask uptake. Results: We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower (and vice versa). With very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case), we estimate that the epidemic would remain under control until at least the end of 2020, with as little as 70-110 new infections estimated over October 1 to December 31 under high mask uptake scenarios, or 340-1400 without masks, depending on the efficacy of community contact tracing. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period would be up to 6 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 17 times higher if the testing rate was 65%, or more than 100 times higher with a 50% testing rate. Conclusions: Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission in dynamic community settings. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling community-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Robyn M Stuart; Romesh G Abeysuriya; Cliff C Kerr; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Richard Gray; Margaret Hellard; Nick Scott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209429,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209429,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
166,The Characteristics of Health Care Workers with COVID-19 and Relationship Between COVID-19 Mortality and BCG/Tuberculosis History: a multi-center study,"BackgroundToday, COVID-19 pandemic has brought countries health services into sharp focus. Despite the low incidence of cases(1.2%) and high mortality rate(2.4%) among Turkish population, the low mortality rate(0.3%) despite the high incidence(11.5%) declared in healthcare workers drew our groups attention. Therefore, we aimed to report the characteristics of infected health-care workers and investigate the relationship between BCG vaccine and tuberculosis history with COVID-19 mortality in infected health-care worker population.

MethodThis study was conducted in three hospitals to assess the clinical presentations, disease severity and correlation with BCG vaccine and tuberculous history in COVID-19 positive health-care workers by an online questionnaire platform. The relationship between characteristics and tuberculosis history were investigated according to hospitalization status of the patients.

ResultTotal of 465 infected healthcare workers included in the study. The rate of history of direct care and contact to tuberculosis patient, presence of previous tuberculosis treatment and BCG scar, presence of radiological infiltrations was significantly higher in hospitalized healthcare workers. The ratio of direct care and direct contact to the patient with tuberculosis, and presence of family history of tuberculosis were statistically significantly higher in patients with radiological infiltrations.

ConclusionAlthough COVID-19 risk and incidence are higher among healthcare workers compared to the normal population due to higher virus load, this study brings evidence for the fact that the lower mortality rate seen in infected healthcare workers might be due to healthcare workers frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of BCG vaccine, despite the higher hospitalization rate and radiological infiltrations due to over-triggered immune system.",Serife Torun; Sevket OZKAYA; Nazan Sen; Fikret Kanat; Irem Karaman; Sebnem Yosunkaya; Ozlem Sengoren Dikis; Ali Asan; Selma Aydogan Eroglu; Sefa Semih Atal; Omer Ayten; Nimet Aksel; Hilal Ermis; Neslihan Ozcelik; Meryem Demirelli; Iskender Kara; Sua Sumer; Kamile Marakoglu; Fatih Uzer; Yasin Uyar; Tuba Cicek; Husamettin Vatansev; Berna Botan Yildirim; Tuba Kuruoglu; Aynur Atilla; Yasemin Ersoy; Bahar Kandemir; Yasemin Durduran; Fatma Goksin Cihan; Nur Demirbas; Fatma Yildirim; M Sule Akcay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209403,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209403,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

We found that anxiety and cognitive impairment are manifested by 28-56% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild or no respiratory symptoms and are associated with altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using an independent cohort, we found histopathological signs of brain damage in 19% of individuals who died of COVID-19. All of the affected brain tissues exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in astrocytes. Infection of neural stem cell-derived astrocytes changed energy metabolism, altered key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons and for biogenesis of neurotransmitters, and elicited a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability.

168,Group Testing with Homophily to Curb Epidemics with Asymptomatic Carriers,"The global fight against COVID-19 is plagued by asymptomatic transmission and false negatives. Group testing is increasingly recognized as necessary to fight this epidemic. I examine the gains from considering heterogeneous interpersonal interactions (homophily), which induce potential contamination, when designing testing pools. Homophily can be identified ex ante at a scale commensurate with pool size, so that the risk of contamination is higher within a well-designed pool than with an outsider. This makes it possible to overcome the usual information-theoretic limits of group testing which rely on an implicit homogeneity assumption. More importantly, group testing with homophily detects asymptomatic carriers that would be missed even by exhaustive individual testing because of false negatives. Such a strategy should be implemented at least at a weekly frequency to fit the time profile of test positivity. It can be used either to avoid unnecessary lockdowns or to make lockdowns more efficient.",Louis-Marie Harpedanne de Belleville,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210260,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210260,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
169,Predicting mortality of individual COVID-19 patients: A multicenter Dutch cohort,"Objective: Develop and validate models that predict mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to the hospital. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: A multicenter cohort across ten Dutch hospitals including patients from February 27 to June 8 2020. Participants: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (age [&ge;] 18) admitted to the hospital. Main Outcome Measures: 21-day mortality evaluated by the area under the receiver operatory curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The predictive value of age was explored by comparison with age-based rules used in practice and by excluding age from analysis. Results: 2273 patients were included, of whom 516 had died or discharged to palliative care within 21 days after admission. Five feature sets, including premorbid, clinical presentation and laboratory & radiology values, were derived from 80 features. Additionally, an ANOVA-based data-driven feature selection selected the ten features with the highest F-values: age, number of home medications, urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, oxygen saturation (%), oxygen saturation is measured on room air, oxygen saturation is measured on oxygen therapy, blood gas pH and history of chronic cardiac disease. A linear logistic regression (LR) and non-linear tree-based gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm fitted the data with an AUC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.85) and 0.82 (0.79 to 0.85), respectively, using the ten selected features. Both models outperformed age-based decision rules used in practice (AUC of 0.69, 0.65 to 0.74 for age > 70). Furthermore, performance remained stable when excluding age as predictor (AUC of 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81) Conclusion: Both models showed excellent performance and had better test characteristics than age-based decision rules, using ten admission features readily available in Dutch hospitals.

170,Gargle-Direct: Extraction-Free Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) of Saline Gargle Rinse Samples,"BackgroundSaline mouth rinse/gargle samples have recently been shown to be a suitable option for swab-independent self-collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. We sought to evaluate a simplified process for direct reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of this novel sample type and to compare performance with routine RT-qPCR using automated nucleic acid extraction.

MethodsClinical saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were subjected to automated nucleic acid extraction (""standard method""), followed by RT-qPCR using three assays including the FDA authorized US-CDCs N1/N2 assay, which was the reference standard for determining sensitivity/specificity. For extraction-free workflow, an aliquot of each gargle sample underwent viral heat inactivation at 65 {degrees}C for 20 minutes followed by RT-qPCR testing, without an intermediate extraction step. An in-house validated RT-qPCR lab developed test (LDT), targeting the SARS-CoV-2s S/ORF8 genes (SORP triplex assay) and the N1/N2 US-CDC assay was used to evaluate the extraction-free protocol. To improve the analytical sensitivity, we developed a single-tube hemi-nested (STHN) version of the SORP triplex assay.

ResultsA total of 38 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 75 negative saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were included in this evaluation. A 100% concordance in detection rate was obtained between the standard method and the extraction-free approach for the SORP assay. An average increase of +2.63 to +5.74 of the cycle threshold (CT) values was observed for both the SORP and N1/N2 assay when extraction-free was compared between the standard method. The average {Delta}CT [{Delta}CT=CT(Direct PCR)-CT(Extracted RNA)], for each of the gene targets were: S ({Delta}CT= +4.24), ORF8 ({Delta}CT=+2.63), N1 ({Delta}CT=+2.74) and N2 ({Delta}CT=+5.74). The {Delta}CT for the STHN SORP assay was +1.51 and -2.05 for the S and ORF8 targets respectively, when extracted method was compared to the standard method.

ConclusionOur Gargle-Direct SARS-CoV-2 method is operationally simple, minimizes pre-analytical sample processing and is potentially implementable by most molecular diagnostic laboratories. The empirical demonstration of single-tube hemi-nested RT-qPCR, to specifically address and alleviate the widely-acknowledged problem of reduced analytical sensitivity of detection of extraction-free templates, should help diagnostic laboratories in choosing Gargle-Direct protocol for high-throughput testing.",Peter Tilley; Vijay Gadkar; David M Goldfarb; Virginia Young; Nicole Watson; Ghada N.

171,Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in recovered COVID-19 patients: studies based on cellular and structural biology analysis,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been reported in several virus infections including dengue fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. To study whether ADE is involved in COVID-19 infections, in vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into Raji cells, K562 cells, and primary B cells mediated by plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients were employed as models. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells was more commonly detected in plasma from severely-affected elderly patients with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. Cellular entry was mediated via the engagement of Fc{gamma}RII receptor through virus-cell membrane fusion, but not by endocytosis. Peptide array scanning analyses showed that antibodies which promote SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted the variable regions of the RBD domain. To further characterize the association between the spike-specific antibody and ADE, an RBD-specific monoclonal antibody (7F3) was isolated from a recovered patient, which potently inhibited SARS-Cov-2 infection of ACE-2 expressing cells and also mediated ADE in Raji cells. Site-directed mutagenesis the spike RBD domain reduced the neutralization activity of 7F3, but did not abolish its binding to the RBD domain. Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed that 7F3 binds to spike proteins at a shift-angled pattern with one ""up"" and two ""down"" RBDs, resulting in partial overlapping with the receptor binding motif (RBM), while a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that lacked ADE activity binds to spike proteins with three ""up"" RBDs, resulting in complete overlapping with RBM. Our results revealed that ADE mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies could result from binding to the receptor in slightly different pattern from antibodies mediating neutralizations. Studies on ADE using antibodies from recovered patients via cell biology and structural biology technology could be of use for developing novel therapeutic and preventive measures for control of COVID-19 infection.",Fan Wu; Renhong Yan; Mei Liu; Zezhong Liu; Yingdan Wang; Die Luan; Kaiyue Wu; Zhigang Song; Tingting Sun; Yunping Ma; Yuanyuan Zhang; Qimin Wang; Xiang Li; Ping Ji; Yaning Li; Cheng Li; Yanling Wu; Tianlei Ying; Yumei Wen; Shibo Jiang; Tongyu Zhu; Lu Lu; Yongzheng Zhang; Qiang Zhou; Jinghe Huang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209114,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209114,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

We then compared these genomes with Wuhan reference sequence and found 4160 mutation events including 2253 missense single nucleotide variations, 38 deletions and 10 insertions. The C>T nucleotide change was most prevalent (41% of all muations) possibly due to selective mutation pressure to reduce CpG sites to evade CpG targeted host immune response. The most frequent mutation that occurred in 98% isolates was 3037C>T which is a synonymous change that almost always accompanied 3 other mutations that include 241C>T, 14408C>T (P323L in RdRp) and 23403A>G (D614G in spike protein). The P323L was reported to increase mutation rate and D614G is associated with increased viral replication and currently most prevalent variant circulating all over the world. We identified multiple missense mutations in B-cell and T-cell predicted epitope regions and/or PCR target regions (including R203K and G204R that occurred in 86% of the isolates) that may impact immunogenicity and/or RT-PCR based diagnosis. Our analysis revealed 5 large deletion events in ORF7a and ORF8 gene products that may be associated with less severity of the disease and increased viral clearance. Our phylogeny analysis identified most of the isolates belonged to the Nextstrain clade 20B (86%) and GISAID clade GR (88%). Most of our isolates shared common ancestors either directly with European countries or jointly with middle eastern countries as well as Australia and India. Interestingly, the 19B clade (GISAID S clade) was unique to Chittagong which was originally prevalent in China. This reveals possible multiple introduction of the virus in Bangladesh via different routes. Hence more genome sequencing and analysis with related clinical data is needed to interpret functional significance and better predict the disease dynamics that may be helpful for policy makers to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.",Md Marufur Rahman; Shirmin Bintay Kader; S M Shahriar Rizvi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336099,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336099,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
173,Structural basis for bivalent binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by human potent neutralizing antibodies,"Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent promising candidates for clinical intervention against coronavirus virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19). We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In order to understand the mechanism of these nAbs on neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, we have performed cryo-EM analysis and here report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG or Fab forms bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBD in the ""up"" conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and their correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.",Renhong Yan; Ruoke Wang; Bin Ju; Jinfang Yu; Yuanyuan Zhang; Nan Liu; Jia Wang; Qi Zhang; Peng Chen; Bing Zhou; Yaning Li; Shuyuan Zhang; Long Tian; Xinyue Zhong; Lin Cheng; Xiangyang Ge; Juanjuan Zhao; Hong-wei Wang; Xinquan Wang; Zheng Zhang; Linqi Zhang; Qiang Zhou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.336800,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.336800,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
174,Sequential infection with influenza A virus followed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to more severe disease and encephalitis in a mouse model of COVID-19.,"COVID-19 is a spectrum of clinical symptoms in humans caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has rapidly caused a pandemic. Coalescence of a second wave of this virus with seasonal respiratory viruses, particularly influenza virus is a possible global health concern. To investigate this, transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) were first infected with IAV followed by SARS-CoV-2. The host response and effect on virus biology was compared to K18-hACE2 mice infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 only. Infection of mice with each individual virus resulted in a disease phenotype compared to control mice. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis appeared significantly reduced in the sequentially infected mice, these mice had a more rapid weight loss, more severe lung damage and a prolongation of the innate response compared to singly infected or control mice. The sequential infection also exacerbated the extrapulmonary manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2. This included a more severe encephalitis. Taken together, the data suggest that the concept of  twinfection is deleterious and mitigation steps should be instituted as part of a comprehensive public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jordan  J.

175,Degradation of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 by tobacco carcinogen-induced Skp2 in lung epithelial cells,"An unexpected observation among the COVID-19 pandemic is that smokers constituted only 1.4-18.5% of hospitalized adults, calling for an urgent investigation to determine the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) increase ACE2 mRNA but trigger ACE2 protein catabolism. BaP induces an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp2 for ACE2 ubiquitination. ACE2 in lung tissues of non-smokers is higher than in smokers, consistent with the findings that tobacco carcinogens downregulate ACE2 in mice. Tobacco carcinogens inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudovirions infection of the cells. Given that tobacco smoke accounts for 8 million deaths including 2.1 million cancer deaths annually and Skp2 is an oncoprotein, tobacco use should not be recommended and cessation plan should be prepared for smokers in COVID-19 pandemic.",Guang-Biao Zhou; Gui-Zhen Wang; Qun Zhao; Fan Liang; Chen Zhang; Hui Zhang; Jun Wang; Zhen-Yin Chen; Ran Wu; Hong Yu; Bei-Bei Sun; Ruie Feng; Kai-Feng Xu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337774,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337774,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
176,Structural impact on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by D614G substitution,"Substitution for aspartic acid by glycine at position 614 in the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic, appears to facilitate rapid viral spread. The G614 variant has now replaced the D614-carrying virus as the dominant circulating strain. We report here cryo-EM structures of a full-length S trimer carrying G614, which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations differing primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain (RBD). A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity. The loop transition may also modulate structural rearrangements of S protein required for membrane fusion.

177,"A 3D Structural Interactome to Explore the Impact of Evolutionary Divergence, Population Variation, and Small-molecule Drugs on SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interactions","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a global public health crisis. Vital to the development of informed treatments for this disease is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions involved in disease pathology. One lens through which we can better understand this pathology is through the network of protein-protein interactions between its viral agent, SARS-CoV-2, and its human host. For instance, increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV can be explained by rapid evolution along the interface between the Spike protein and its human receptor (ACE2) leading to increased binding affinity. Sequence divergences that modulate other protein-protein interactions may further explain differences in transmission and virulence in this novel coronavirus. To facilitate these comparisons, we combined homology-based structural modeling with the ECLAIR pipeline for interface prediction at residue resolution, and molecular docking with PyRosetta. This enabled us to compile a novel 3D structural interactome meta-analysis for the published interactome network between SARS-CoV-2 and human. This resource includes docked structures for all interactions with protein structures, enrichment analysis of variation along interfaces, predicted {Delta}{Delta}G between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants for each interaction, predicted impact of natural human population variation on binding affinity, and a further prioritized set of drug repurposing candidates predicted to overlap with protein interfaces{dagger}. All predictions are available online{dagger} for easy access and are continually updated when new interactions are published.

178,Pilot production of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins in plants: a proof of concept for rapid repurposing of indoors farms into biomanufacturing facilities,"The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the worlds capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were all engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.",Borja Diego-Martin; Beatriz González; Marta Vazquez-Vilar; Sara Selma; Rubén Mateos-Fernández; Silvia Gianoglio; Asun Fernández-del-Carmen; Diego Orzaez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.331306,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.331306,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False

180,"Sero-prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","BackgroundAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are being increasingly used for sero-epidemiological purposes to provide better understanding of the extent of the infection in the community, and monitoring the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. We conducted sero-prevalence study to estimate prior infection with with SARS-CoV-2 in Addis Ababa.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was done from April 23 to 28, 2020 among 301 randomly selected residents of Addis Ababa; with no known history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 person. Interviews on socio demographic and behavioural risk factor followed by serological tests were performed for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and IgG antibodies, using COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. The test has sensitivity of 87{middle dot}9% and specificity of 100% for lgM; and a sensitivity of 97{middle dot}2% and specificity of 100% for IgG. RT-PCR test was also done on combined nasopharyngeal and oropharengeal swabs as an important public health consideration.

FindingsThe unadjusted antibody-based crude SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 7{middle dot}6% and the adjusted true SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was estimated at 8{middle dot}8% (95% CI 5{middle dot}5%-11{middle dot}6%) for the study population. Higher sero-prevalence were observed for males (9.0%), age below 50 years (8.2%), students and unemployed (15.6%), those with primary education (12.1%), smokers (7.8%), alcohol consumers (8.6%), chatt-chewers (13.6%) and shish smokers (18.8%). Seroprevalence was not significantly associated neither with socio-demographic not behavioral characteristics. According to the findings, possibly more individuals had been infected in Addis Ababa than what was being detected and reported by RT-PCR test suggestive of community transmission. The use of serological test for epidemiological estimation of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic gives a more precise estimate of magnitude which would be used for further monitoring and surveillance of the magnitude of the SARS CoV-2 infection.",Berhanu Nega; Adamu Addissie; Gemechis Mamo; Negussie Deyessa; Tamrat Abebe; Abdulnasir Abagero; Wondimu Ayele; Workeabeba Abebe; Tewodros Haile; Rahel Argaw; Wondwossen Amogne; Ayele Belachew; Zelalem Desalegn; Brhanu Teka; Eva Kantelhardt; Mesfin Wossen; Saro Abdella; Getachew Tollera; Lia Tadesse,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337287,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337287,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
181,"Elevated antiviral, myeloid and endothelial inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19","The mechanisms that underpin COVID-19 disease severity, and determine the outcome of infection, are only beginning to be unraveled. The host inflammatory response contributes to lung injury, but circulating mediators levels fall below those in classical cytokine storms. We analyzed serial plasma samples from 619 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC clinical characterization protocol U.K. study and 39 milder community cases not requiring hospitalization. Elevated levels of numerous mediators including angiopoietin-2, CXCL10, and GM-CSF were seen at recruitment in patients who later died. Markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2 and von-Willebrand factor A2) were detected early in some patients, while inflammatory cytokines and markers of lung injury persisted for several weeks in fatal COVID-19 despite decreasing antiviral cytokine levels. Overall, markers of myeloid or endothelial cell activation were associated with severe, progressive, and fatal disease indicating a central role for innate immune activation and vascular inflammation in COVID-19.",Ryan Thwaites; Ashley Sanchez Sevilla Uruchurtu; Matthew Siggins; Felicity Liew; Clark D Russell; Shona Moore; Edwin Carter; Simon Abrams; Charlotte-Eve Short; Thilipan Thaventhiran; Emma Bergstrom; Zoe Gardener; Stephanie Ascough; Christopher Chiu; Annemarie B Docherty; David Hunt; Yanick Crow; Tom Solomon; Graham Taylor; Lance Turtle; Ewen M Harrison; Malcolm Gracie Semple; J Kenneth Baillie; Peter JM Openshaw,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209411,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
182,Estimating the impact of disruptions due to COVID-19 on HIV transmission and control among men who have sex with men in China,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic is impacting HIV care globally, with gaps in HIV treatment expected to increase HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality. We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China.

MethodsRegional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%). A deterministic mathematical model of HIV transmission and treatment among MSM in China was used to estimate the impact of these disruptions on the number of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over 1 and 5 years for a 3-, 4- or 6-month disruption period.

ResultsOur China model predicted that new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions for a 3-month period increasing HIV infections by 5-14% over 1 year and deaths by 7-12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5-14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11-23% fewer infections and 0.4-1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods of 4 and 6 months amplified the impact of combined disruption scenarios. When all realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections was always predicted over one year (3-17%), but not over 5 years (1% increase-4% decrease), while deaths mostly increased over one year (1-2%) and 5 years (1.2 increase - 0.3 decrease).

ConclusionsThe overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19 related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.",Ross D Booton; Gengfeng Fu; Louis MacGregor; Jianjun Li; Jason J Ong; Joseph D Tucker; Katy ME Turner; Weiming Tang; Peter Vickerman; Kate Mitchell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209072,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209072,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
183,Characteristics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections among ambulatory and hospitalized children and adolescents in an integrated health care system in Tennessee,"BackgroundLittle is known regarding the full spectrum of illness among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection across ambulatory and inpatient settings.

MethodsActive surveillance was performed for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a quaternary care academic hospital laboratory in Tennessee from March 12-July 17, 2020. For symptomatic patients [&le;]18 years of age, we performed phone follow-up and medical record review to obtain sociodemographic and clinical data on days 2, 7, and 30 after diagnosis and on day 30 for asymptomatic patients [&le;]18 years. Daily and 7-day average test positivity frequencies were calculated for children and adults beginning April 26, 2020.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 was detected in 531/10327 (5.1%) specimens from patients [&le;]18 years, including 46/5752 (0.8%) asymptomatic and 485/4575 (10.6%) specimens from 459 unique symptomatic children. Cough (51%), fever (42%), and headache (41%) were the most common symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization was uncommon (18/459 children; 4%); no children with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period required intensive care unit admission. Symptom resolution occurred by follow-up day 2 in 192/459 (42%), by day 7 in 332/459 (72%), and by day 30 in 373/396 (94%). The number of cases and percent positivity rose in late June and July in all ages.

ConclusionsIn an integrated healthcare network, most pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were mild, brief, and rarely required hospital admission, despite increasing cases as community response measures were relaxed.

184,A rapid and cost-effective multiplex ARMS-PCR method for the simultaneous genotyping of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clades,"Tracing the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants is essential for the outbreak alerts and far-reaching epidemiological surveillance. The available technique to identify the phylogenetic clades through high-throughput sequencing is costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive that hinders the viral genotyping in low-income countries. Here, we propose a rapid, simple and cost-effective amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-based multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR assay to identify six distinct phylogenetic clades: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR. This approach is applied on 24 COVID-19 positive samples as confirmed by CDC approved real-time PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. Our multiplex PCR is designed in a mutually exclusive way to identify V-S and G-GH-GR clade variants separately. The pentaplex assay included all five variants and the quadruplex comprised of the triplex variants alongside either V or S clade mutations that created two separate subsets. The procedure was optimized in the primer concentration (0.2-0.6 {micro}M) and annealing temperature (56-60{degrees}C) of PCR using 3-5 ng/{micro}l cDNA template synthesized upon random- and oligo(dT)-primer based reverse transcription. The different primer concentration for the triplex and quadruplex adjusted to different strengths ensured an even amplification with a maximum resolution of all targeted amplicons. The targeted Sanger sequencing further confirmed the presence of the clade-featured mutations with another set of our designed primers. This multiplex ARMS-PCR assay is sample, cost-effective, and convenient that can successfully discriminate the circulating phylogenetic clades of SARS-CoV-2.",Md. Tanvir Islam; A. S. M.

185,Estimating the effect of social inequalities in the mitigation of COVID-19 across communities in Santiago de Chile,"We study the spatio-temporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Santiago de Chile using anonymized mobile phone data from 1.4 million users, 22% of the whole population in the area, characterizing the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the epidemic dynamics. We integrate these data into a mechanistic epidemic model calibrated on surveillance data. As of August 1, 2020, we estimate a detection rate of 102 cases per 1,000 infections (90% CI: [95 - 112 per 1,000]). We show that the introduction of a full lockdown on May 15, 2020, while causing a modest additional decrease in mobility and contacts with respect to previous NPIs, was decisive in bringing the epidemic under control, highlighting the importance of a timely governmental response to COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that the impact of NPIs on individuals' mobility correlates with the Human Development Index of comunas in the city. Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic. The heterogeneity of COVID-19 impact raises important issues in the implementation of NPIs and highlights the challenges that communities affected by systemic health and social inequalities face adapting their behaviors during an epidemic.",Nicolò Gozzi; Michele Tizzoni; Matteo Chinazzi; Leo Ferres; Alessandro Vespignani; Nicola Perra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204750,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204750,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
186,Estimating the Burden of COVID-19 Symptoms Among Participants at the 2020 USA Curling Club Nationals Tournament,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with evidence suggesting that activities involving heavier breathing, such as singing and exercise, can result in increased risk for disease transmission. The USA Curling Club Nationals is a week-long curling tournament to determine the mens and womens club-level champions. The 2020 tournament took place March 7-14 at the Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, MD, and featured teams from across the United States. Preventative measures, such as increased cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, single use and disposable food containers, and canceling traditional event banquets were implemented. Despite these measures, players, coaches, officials, volunteers, and spectators contracted the virus as a result of participation in the event. We surveyed participants to assess total positivity, potential days of transmission, and the burden of symptoms experienced among the participants. We found that 55.6% of all participants reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with nearly all experiencing more than one symptom. Although most participants symptoms resolved quickly, 9.6% of all participants experienced symptoms for at least one month and 12.6% of all participants reported taking at least 30 days before they felt they had returned to normal. As a result of this study, we believe curling tournaments have the potential to be high-risk events for the transmission of COVID-19.

State-specific aCFRs were estimated, using 13-day lag for fatality. To estimate country-level aCFR, state estimates were meta-analysed. Multiple correspondence analyses (MCA), followed by univariable logistic regression, were conducted to understand the association between aCFR and geodemographic, health and social indicators. Based on health indicators, states likely to report a higher aCFR were identified. Using random- and fixed-effects models, the aCFRs in India were 1.42 (95% CI 1.19 - 1.70) and 2.97 (95% CI 2.94 - 3.00), respectively. The aCFR was grouped with the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and acute respiratory infections in the first and second dimensions of MCA. The current study demonstrated the value of using meta-analysis to estimate aCFR.

188,COVID-19 serological survey using micro blood sampling,"During August 2020, we carried out a serological survey among students and employees at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), Japan, testing for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We used a FDA-authorized 2-step ELISA protocol developed by the Krammer Lab (1, 2) in combination with at-home self-collection of blood samples using a custom low-cost finger prick-based capillary blood collection kit. Although our survey did not find any COVID-19 seropositive individuals among the OIST cohort, it reliably detected all positive control samples obtained from a local hospital and excluded all negatives controls. Among our controls, we found strong cross-reactivity of antibodies in samples from a serum pool from two MERS patients in the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S ELISA. Here we show that a centralized ELISA in combination with patient-based capillary blood collection using as little as one drop of blood can reliably assess the seroprevalence among communities. Anonymous sample tracking and an integrated website created a stream-lined procedure. Major parts of the workflow were automated on a liquid handler, demonstrating scalability.

189,Examining Unit Costs for COVID-19 Case Management in Kenya,"Introduction Case management for COVID-19 patients is one of key interventions in country responses to the pandemic. Countries need information on the costs of case management to inform resource mobilization, planning and budgeting, purchasing arrangements, and assessments of the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We estimated unit costs for COVID-19 case management for patients with asymptomatic, mild to moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 disease in Kenya. Methods We estimated per patient per day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients that are asymptomatic and those that have mild to moderate, severe, and critical symptoms. For asymptomatic and mild to moderate patients, we estimated unit costs for home-based care and institutional (hospitals and isolation centers). We used an ingredients approach, adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from COVID-19 case management guidelines, home based care guidelines, and human resource guidelines, and augmented this with data provided by three public covid-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya. We obtained input prices for services from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and for pharmaceuticals, non-pharmaceuticals, devices and equipment from market price databases for Kenya. Results Per day per patient unit cost for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease under home based care are KES 1,993.01 (USD 18.89) and 1995.17 (USD 18.991) respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation center of hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate disease are 7,415.28 (USD 70.29) and 7,417.44 (USD 70.31) respectively. Per day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19 disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in intensive care units are 12,570.75 (USD 119.16) and 59,369.42 (USD 562.79).",Edwine Barasa; Angela Kairu; Wangari Nganga; Marybeth Maritim; Vincent Were; Samuel Akech; Mercy Mwangangi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209684,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209684,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
190,Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis and HIV services: a cross-sectional survey of 669 health professionals in 64 low and middle-income countries,"Background The disruption of essential services for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and HIV is likely to result in the indirect health impacts of COVID-19 being even greater than the direct impacts. The experiences of frontline health professionals are invaluable in understanding how to minimise disruption of healthcare services during emergency situations, but are insufficiently incorporated into policy planning. We synthesised information from frontline TB and HIV professionals to identify ways in which COVID-19 has affected services in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), and strategies to minimise impacts on patients and healthcare providers. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV healthcare delivery, management, and research professionals in LMIC around the world. Between May 12 and August 6 2020, we collected qualitative and quantitative data using an online survey disseminated through professional networks and social media in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse responses. Results 669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey, representing a 72% response rate. Over 40% of respondents stated that it was impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since COVID-19. The most common barriers reported to affect patient utilisation of healthcare facilities were: fear of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions, movement restrictions, and reduced income. Healthcare provider access to healthcare facilities was also severely impacted according to 37% of TB respondents and 28% of HIV respondents. In line with this finding, qualitative responses focused on strategies to facilitate transport of patients and healthcare providers or service delivery adaptations to reduce the need for patients to travel to healthcare facilities. While only 16% and 11% of respondents reported major disruptions to provision of medical treatment for HIV or TB, access to non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was harder or impossible to access according to 35% and 31% of HIV and TB respondents respectively. Our qualitative data suggested that nutritional support became critical for some patients when movement restrictions and employment instability reduced access to income and food. Discussion Our large multi-country survey indicated that patients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in accessing healthcare facilities, and that critical non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation and counselling, was particularly impacted by COVID-19 disruptions. Frontline professionals identified important policies and healthcare service delivery adaptations that could mitigate disruptions in the future. It is essential to facilitate sharing of their experiences with policymakers and healthcare service delivery organisations.",Mishal Khan; Sonia Rego; Joaquin Benitez Rajal; Virginia Bond; Razia Kaneez Fatima; Afshan Khurshid Isani; Jayne Sutherland; Katharina Kranzer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20207969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20207969,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
191,Evaluation of saliva sampling procedures for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics reveals differential sensitivity and association with viral load,"Nasopharyngeal sampling has been the preferential collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a healthcare professional would be more preferable for patients and health professionals. Saliva collection has been proposed as such a possible alternative sampling procedure. We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices (spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral load, sensitivity increased substantially (97.0% and 76.7% for spitting and swabbing, respectively), irrespective of symptomatic status. Our results suggest that saliva cannot readily replace nasopharyngeal sampling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics but may enable identification of cases with medium to high viral loads.",Pieter Mestdagh; Michel Gillard; Marc Arbyn; Jean-Paul Pirnay; Jeroen Poels; Jan Hellemans; Eliana Peeters; Veronik Hutse; Celine Vermeiren; Maxime Boutier; Veerle De Wever; Patrick Soentjens; Sarah Djebara; Hugues Malonne; Emmanuel Andre; John Smeraglia; Jo Vandesompele,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207902,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207902,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of 405 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Kuwait. Outcomes such as symptoms severity and mortality were considered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to report the odds ratios (OR) for ICU admission and dying from COVID-19.

ResultsThe cohort included 290 Arabs and 115 South Asians. South Asians recorded significantly higher COVID-19 death rates compared to Arabs (33% vs. 7.6%, P value<0.001). When compared to Arabs, South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 3.34 - 11.80, p < 0.001). South Asian patients showed 7.62 (95% CI: 3.62 - 16.02, p < 0.001) times the odds of dying from COVID-19.

ConclusionCOVID-19 patients with South Asians ethnicity are more likely to have worse prognosis and outcome when compared to patients with Arab ethnicity.

We used internal-external cross-validation to show consistent measures of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility across eight geographical regions. We further validated the final model in held-out data from 8,252 individuals in London, with similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0.77 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.78); calibration-in-the-large 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.06); calibration slope 0.96 (0.90 to 1.02)).

However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2.

196,"The risk for a new COVID-19 wave -- and how it depends on $R_0$, the current immunity level and current restrictions","The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: some regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The current immunity level i in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0, i and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures pMin needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level i plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different R0 and i it is shown that regions with lower R0 and low i may now need higher preventive measures (pMin) compared with other regions having higher R0 but also higher i, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.",Tom Britton; Pieter Trapman; Frank G Ball,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209981,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209981,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
197,Determinants of Developing Symptomatic Disease in Ethiopian COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundStudies show that having some symptoms seems to be associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The aim of the study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a randomly selected 765 COVID-19 patients (372 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients). Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls (asymptomatic), where p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsThe result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR= 1.818, 95% CI= 1.210, 2.731, p-value=0.004 for 30-39 years; AOR= 1.611, 95% CI= 1.016, 2.554, p-value=0.043 for 40-49 years and AOR= 4.076, 95% CI= 2.582, 6.435, p-value=0.0001 for years and above), sex (AOR= 1.672, 95% CI= 1.216, 2.299, p-value=0.002) and history of diabetes mellitus (AOR= 2.406, 95% CI= 1.384, 4.181, p-value=0.002) were found to be significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsDeveloping a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be determined by exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic.

Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to fully converge the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all the days), a 40-67% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region.

199,COVID-19 Disease Severity and Determinants among Ethiopian Patients: A study of the Millennium COVID-19 Care Center,"BackgroundUnderstanding determinants of developing severe COVID-19 disease is important as studies show that severe disease is associated with worse outcomes.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among randomly selected 686 patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe), where p-value of <0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant difference. A Multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a significant association between the independent variables and COVID-19 disease severity where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsHaving moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with having hypertension (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR= 6.115, 95% CI= 2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-value=0.003). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated with age group (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR=18.070, 95% CI=9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), sex (AOR=1.842, 95% CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016), hypertension (AOR= 1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-value=0.028), diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964, 7.847, p-value=0.0001), fever (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 4.816, 95% CI= 2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001). In addition, determinants of severe disease as compared with moderate disease were found to be age group (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), fever (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI= 1.286, 3.634, p-value=0.004) and headache (AOR= 1.787, 95% CI= 1.028, 3.107, p-value=0.039).

ConclusionsBeing old, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and having symptoms of fever and headache were found to be determinants of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease category. We recommend a better preventive practice to be set in place so that these groups of patients can be protected from acquiring the disease. And for those who are already infected, a more careful follow-up and management should be given so that complication and death can be prevented.

Simple mathematical model, the SIR model, provided lower estimation for R0, ranging from 1.5 to 3.0. However, more elaborate model presented here estimated higher value for R0, 9.24 and 8.0 respectively, for Sao Paulo State (Brazil) and Spain.

202,Estimating epidemiologic dynamics from single cross-sectional viral load distributions,"Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemics trajectory, subverting the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence data is not available.

203,Within-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, is evolving into different genetic variants by accumulating mutations as it spreads globally. In addition to this diversity of consensus genomes across patients, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within individual hosts, and co-existing viral variants may affect disease progression and the success of medical interventions. To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity.

Author SummarySince it arose in late 2019, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) behind the COVID-19 pandemic has mutated and evolved during its global spread. Individual patients may host different versions, or variants, of the virus, hallmarked by different mutations. We examine the diversity of genetic variants coexisting within patients across a cohort of 3939 publicly accessible samples and 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We find that a small number of patients carry most of the diversity, and that patients with more diversity tend to be older. We also find that most of the diversity is concentrated in certain regions and positions of the virus genome. In particular, we find that a variant reported to increase infectivity is among the most diverse positions. Our study provides a large-scale survey of within-patient diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",Jack Kuipers; Aashil  A Batavia; Kim Philipp Jablonski; Fritz Bayer; Nico Borgsmüller; Arthur Dondi; Monica-Andreea Drăgan; Pedro Ferreira; Katharina Jahn; Lisa Lamberti; Martin Pirkl; Susana Posada-Céspedes; Ivan Topolsky; Ina Nissen; Natascha Santacroce; Elodie Burcklen; Tobias Schär; Vincenzo Capece; Christiane Beckmann; Olivier Kobel; Christoph Noppen; Maurice Redondo; Sarah Nadeau; Sophie Seidel; Noemi Santamaria de Souza; Christian Beisel; Tanja Stadler; Niko Beerenwinkel,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335919,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335919,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
204,Determinants of Time to Convalescence among COVID-19 Patients at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia: A prospective cohort study,"AimTo estimate time to recovery/convalescence and identify determinants among COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance.

ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 32.4 years ({+/-} 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040).

ConclusionsPresence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.

Key MessagesO_LIThe study assessed the time to RT-PCR proven recovery (two consecutive negative viral shedding) and identified determinants that affected the time.
C_LIO_LISymptomatic infection is associated with delayed viral clearance.
C_LIO_LIThe finding of the study could be used to guide the isolation and treatment practice.

207,Safely Reopening K-12 Schools During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Early school closures were a consistent, nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March due to the role that children play in spreading influenza. This left us with limited understanding of COVID-19 transmission in children until several states reopened schools for the 2020-2021 school year. While early school closures were likely beneficial in protecting children in the initial stages of the pandemic in the U.S., long-term closures pose significant cumulative effects in children who rely on schools for instruction and additional social services, and for parents who need to balance work and childcare obligations. Reopening schools safely is a high priority for many interested stakeholders.

Proposed in-person school reopening plans include traditional, 100% school capacity, five days per week instruction, hybrid scenarios with reduced in-person instruction and virtual learning, and various reduced school capacity schedules with non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. To assess the potential impacts of different reopening plans, we created a modified SIR-type transmission model that captures multiple known pathways of COVID-19 transmission in a 100,000-person community.

Our results show that plans that utilize consecutive days in school and divide students into separated smaller cohorts who attend school together, as well as plans that emphasize distance learning, are better able to suppress disease spread and reduce risk from an introduced infective into the community. Plans with more consecutive school days are protective for both the schoolchildren and surrounding community by acting to separate the larger intermixing population into smaller intermixing subpopulations. The ""Five-Day Switch"" plan, which separates students into two cohorts, each of whom attend in-person learning for five consecutive days followed by five days of distance learning, best captures these protective attributes. All modeled plans assumed initially disease-free communities and that childrens interactions with the community are greatly reduced during instructional days, both for in-person and distance learning.",Courtney D Shelley; Philippa S Chadwick; Carrie Manore; Sara Y Del Valle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208710,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208710,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
208,An Innovative Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention to Mitigate SARS-CoV02 Spread: Probability Sampling to Identify and Isolate Asymptomatic Cases,"Studies estimate that a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs through individuals who do not exhibit symptoms. Mitigation strategies test only those who are moderately to severely symptomatic, excluding the substantial portion of cases that are asymptomatic yet still infectious and likely responsible for a large proportion of the virus spread (1-8). While isolating asymptomatic cases will be necessary to effectively control viral spread, these cases are functionally invisible and there is no current method to identify them for isolation. To address this major omission in COVID-19 control, we develop a strategy, Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), for identifying and isolating individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the epidemic. STQ uses probability sampling in the general population, regardless of symptoms, then isolates the individuals who test positive along with their household members who are high probability for asymptomatic infections. To test the potential efficacy of STQ, we use an agent-based model, designed to computationally simulate the epidemic in the Seattle with infection parameters, like R0 and asymptomatic fraction, derived from population data. Our results suggest that STQ can substantially slow and decrease the spread of COVID-19, even in the absence of school and work shutdowns. Results also recommend which sampling techniques, frequency of implementation, and population subject to isolation are most efficient in reducing spread with limited numbers of tests.

Significance StatementA substantial portion of SARS-CoV-2 infections are spread through asymptomatic carriers. Until a vaccine is developed, research indicates an urgent need to identify these asymptomatic infections to control COVID-19, but there is currently no effective strategy to do so. In this study, we develop such a strategy, a procedure called Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), that combines techniques from survey methods for sampling from the general population and testing and isolation techniques from epidemiology. With computational simulations, we demonstrate that STQ procedures can dramatically decrease and slow COVID-19 spread, even in the absence of widespread work, school, and community lockdowns. We also find particular implementation strategies (including sampling techniques, frequencies of implementation, and people who are subject to isolation) are most efficient in mitigating spread.",Nathalie E Williams; Xiaozheng Yao; Ankita Pall; Xiaolu Qian; Mansi Rathod; Chang Xu; Adrian Dobra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208686,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208686,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
209,Forecasting COVID-19 cases in the Philippines using various mathematical models,"Due to the rapid increase of COVID-19 infection cases in many countries such as the Philippines, many efforts in forecasting the daily infections have been made in order to better manage the pandemic, and respond effectively. In this study, we consider the cumulative COVID-19 infection cases in the Philippines from March 6 to July 31,2020 and forecast the cases from August 1 - 15, 2020 using various mathematical models --weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, and random forest. We then compare the results to the actual data using traditional error metrics. Our results show that the ARIMA(1,2,1) model has the closest forecast values to the actual data.

210,Using test positivity and reported case rates to estimate state-level COVID-19 prevalence in the United States,"Accurate estimates of the prevalence of infection are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (US), but reliable, timely prevalence data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates may provide strongly biased estimates. A single parameter semi-empirical model was developed, calibrated, and validated with prevalence predictions from two independent data-driven mathematical epidemiological models, each of which was separately validated using available cumulative infection estimates from recent state-wide serological testing in 6 states. The analysis shows that individually, reported case rates and test positivity rates may provide substantially biased estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission trends in the U.S. However, the COVID-19 prevalence for U.S. states from March-July, 2020 is well approximated, with a 7-day lag, by the geometric mean of reported case and test positivity rates averaged over the previous 14 days. Predictions of this semi-empirical model are at least 10-fold more accurate than either test positivity or reported case rates alone, with accuracy that remains relatively constant across different US states and varying testing rates. The use of this simple and readily-available surrogate metric for COVID-19 prevalence, that is more accurate than test positivity and reported case rates and does not rely on mathematical modeling, may provide more reliable information for decision makers to make effective state-level decisions as to public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the US.",Weihsueh chiu; Martial L Ndeffo-Mbah,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208504,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208504,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
211,Evaluating the impact of curfews and other measures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in French Guiana,"While general lockdowns have proven effective to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, they come with enormous costs for society. It is therefore essential to identify control strategies with lower social and economic impact. Here, we report and evaluate the control strategy implemented during a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in June-July 2020 in French Guiana that relied on curfews, targeted lockdowns and other measures. We find that the combination of these interventions reduced the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from 1.7 to 1.1, which was sufficient to avoid saturation of hospitals. We estimate that thanks to the young demographics across the territory, the risk of hospitalisation following infection was 0.3 times that of metropolitan France and that about 20% of the population was infected by July. Our model projections are consistent with a recent seroprevalence study.

212,SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells correlate with neutralizing antibodies and increase during convalescence.,"T-cell immunity is likely to play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 by helping generate neutralizing antibodies. We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 21 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mount at least one CD4 T-cell response, and 48% of individuals mount detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh, defined as CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that M and N protein-specific pTfh may also assist in the development of neutralizing antibodies and that pTfh response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Author SummarySince December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most currently licensed vaccines are understood to protect against infection by inducing neutralizing antibodies. As such, ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials have focused on antibody neutralization as a primary immunologic endpoint. It is well established that T follicular helper cells are essential to the development of neutralizing antibodies and that a subset of these cells, peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh), can be studied in the blood. However, little is known about Tfh responses mounted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we studied pTfh to three major structural proteins in individuals recovered from COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh frequencies correlate with neutralizing antibody responses, especially those directed against the spike protein. We also find that pTfh responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase over time. Our findings suggest that pTfh responses against proteins other than the spike protein may contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies and suggests that formation of pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be delayed.",Sushma Boppana; Kai Qin; Jacob K Files; Ronnie M.

213,Understanding the phase separation characteristics of nucleocapsid protein provides a new therapeutic opportunity against SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",Dan Zhao; Weifan Xu; Xiaofan Zhang; Xiaoting Wang; Enming Yuan; Yuanpeng Xiong; Shenyang Wu; Shuya Li; Nian Wu; Tingzhong Tian; Xiaolong Feng; Hantao Shu; Peng Lang; Xiaokun Shen; Haitao Li; Pilong Li; Jianyang Zeng,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332734,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332734,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
214,The effect of salt on the dynamics of CoV-2 RBD at ACE2,"In this article, we investigate the effect of electrolytes on the stability of the complex between the coronavirus type 2 spike protein receptor domain (CoV-2 RBD) and ACE2, which plays an important role in the activation cascade at the viral entry of CoV-2 into human cells. At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. Additionally, the binding interface of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is highly hydrophilic. We simulated the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex at varying salt concentrations over the concentration range from 0.03 M to 0.3 M of calcium and sodium chloride over an individual simulation length of 750 ns in 9 independent simulations (6.75 {micro}s total). We observe that the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is stabilized independent of the salt concentration. We identify a strong negative electrostatic potential at the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD and we find that CoV-2 RBD binds even stronger at higher salt concentrations. We observe that the dynamics of the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD stabilize the protein complex leading to strong collective motions and a stable interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. We state that the sequence of CoV-2 RBD might be optimized for a strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations at the cellular surface, which acts as a key component in the activation of CoV-2 for its viral entry.

SIGNIFICANCEA novel coronavirus, coronavirus type 2 (CoV-2), was identified as primary cause for a worldwide pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV-2). The CoV-2 spike protein is a major target for the development of a vaccine and potential strategies to inhibit the viral entry into human cells. At the cellular surface, CoV-2 activation involves the direct interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD. At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. We thus investigate the effect of ion conditions on the interaction of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex and find stabilizing effects. We speculate that CoV-2 RBD is optimized for strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations.",Emanuel Peter; Alexander Schug,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333948,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333948,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
215,"Estimated Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Among Adults in Orange County, California","BackgroundClinic-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 may considerably underestimate the total number of infections. Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million).

MethodsWe implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered a SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n=2,979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests.

FindingsParticipants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5% to 12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR]= 1.47, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.78) and household income <$50,000 (vs. >$100,000: PR= 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79).

InterpretationResults from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of [~]12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics. In this region, SARS-CoV-2 also disproportionately affects Hispanic and low-income adults.

217,One size fits all?: Modeling face-mask fit on population-based faces,"The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has to date, not been examined and quantified. Here, we study the leakage of a rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects with diverse facial features, using computational mechanics modeling. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the leakage is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended mask size was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. Thin, feminine, and young faces benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. The results show that side-edge tuck-in of the masks could lead to a larger localized gap opening in many face categories, and is therefore not recommended for all. The perimeter leakage from the face mask worn by thin/feminine faces is mostly from the leakage area along the bottom edge of the mask and therefore, a tuck-in of the bottom edge of the mask or a mask smaller than the CDC recommended mask size are proposed as a more effective design. The leakage from the top edge of the mask is determined to be largely unaffected by mask size and tuck-in ratio, meaning that other mechanical alterations such as a nose wire strip are necessary to reduce the leakage at this site.",Tomas Solano; Rajat Mittal; Kourosh Shoele,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208744,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208744,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
218,Level of Knowledge in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Canadian Medical Students,"BackgroundDuring health crises medical education is often derailed as was the case during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical trainees face the daunting task of having to gather, filter and synthesize new information about the evolving situation often without the standardized resources they are used to.

MethodsWe surveyed Canadian medical students, in the hardest hit province of Quebec, on how they were acquiring knowledge as well as what they knew of the pandemic. Google Forms was used, with the survey being distributed to each medical school in Quebec (McGill, ULaval, Udem) both through email and through social media pages for each class year. Two analyses, Mann-Whitney and ANOVA tests, were performed for year of study and degree obtained.

ResultsWe received responses from 111 medical students from three universities, which represents 5% of the students invited to complete the survey. Students reported using mass media most frequently (83%) and also had a high rate of use of social media (to gather information about the pandemic. They rated these resources low in terms of their trustworthiness despite the high rates of use (average 2.91 and 2.03 of 5 respectively). Medical students also endorsed using more formal resources like public health information, scientific journals and faculty-provided information that they trusted more, however, they accessed these resources at lower rates. Of note, medical students had correct answered 60% of COVID-19 prevention strategies, 73% clinical correct answers, 90% epidemiological correct answers. Additionally, students who were training in the larger city of Montreal, where the worst of the outbreak was focused, tended to significantly perform better (p<0.0001) than their colleagues who were not located there.

ConclusionThese finding indicate a wide use of information resources intended for public consumption rather than more rigorous and trustworthy sources.

219,Prevalence of COVID-19-related risk factors and risk of severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors: a matched cohort study using linked English electronic health records data,"BackgroundPeople with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk. We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses.

MethodsWe included survivors ([&ge;]1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from UK primary care data linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for baseline demographics and comorbidities.

Findings108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer survivors had more asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, diabetes, neurological, renal, and liver disease, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR 2.22, 1.31-3.74).

InterpretationRisks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer survivors.

FundingWellcome Trust, Royal Society, NIHR.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSFew data are available to date on how COVID-19 affects cancer survivors. We searched PubMed with the keywords ""influenza cancer survivors"" to identify studies that compared severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors and in a control group. No study was identified.

Added value of this studyIn this matched cohort study of routinely collected electronic health records, we demonstrated raised risks of influenza hospitalisation or mortality in survivors from haematological malignancies for >10 years after diagnosis, and in survivors from solid cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis.

Implications of all the available evidenceCancer survivorship appears to be an important risk factor for severe influenza outcomes, suggesting that cancer survivors may also be at raised risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes. This should be taken into account in public health policies targeted at protecting clinical risk groups. Influenza vaccination should be encouraged in this group, and may need to be extended to a wider population of medium- to long-term cancer survivors than currently recommended.",Helena Carreira; Helen Strongman; Maria Peppa; Helen I McDonald; Isabel dos-Santos-Silva; Susannah Stanway; Liam Smeeth; Krishnan Bhaskaran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209304,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209304,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
220,"COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity Risks in a Survey of Over 500,000 People","The growing toll of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency of identifying individuals most at risk of infection and severe outcomes, underscoring the need to assess susceptibility and severity patterns in large datasets. The AncestryDNA COVID-19 Study collected self-reported survey data on symptoms, outcomes, risk factors, and exposures for over 563,000 adult individuals in the U.S., including over 4,700 COVID-19 cases as measured by a self-reported positive nasal swab test. We observed significant associations between several risk factors and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity outcomes. Many of the susceptibility associations were accounted for by differences in known exposures; a notable exception was elevated susceptibility odds for males after adjusting for known exposures and age. We also leveraged the dataset to build risk models to robustly predict individualized COVID-19 susceptibility (area under the curve [AUC]=0.84) and severity outcomes including hospitalization and life-threatening critical illness amongst COVID-19 cases (AUC=0.87 and 0.90, respectively).

221,Physical health complaints among healthcare workers engaged in the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients: A single tertiary-care center prospective study from Japan,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) who care for patients with the novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) are at an increased risk and fear contracting the infection themselves. HCWs are chronically exposed to very intense stress, both and physically and mentally. Hospitals must reduce both the physical and mental burden of HCWs on the front lines and ensure their safety. No prospective study has focused on the physical health complaints among HCWs engaged in the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate the occupational risk among HCWs of experiencing physical symptoms during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA twice-weekly questionnaire targeting HCWs who care for COVID-19 patients was performed at Osaka City University Hospital from April 30 to May 31, 2020 using a shareable Research Electronic Data Capture tool. The demographic characteristics of the participants, frequency of exposure to at-risk care, and physical complaints were evaluated.

ResultsA total of 35 doctors, 88 nurses, and 35 technicians were engaged in the care of these critically ill COVID-19 patients. 76 HCWs participated in this study, of whom 24 (31.6%) were doctors, 43 (56.6%) were nurses, and 9 (11.8%) were technicians. The frequency of experiencing any physical symptom was 25.0% among HCWs. Exposure to at-risk care was significantly higher among nurses than among doctors (p < 0.001); likewise, the frequency of experiencing physical symptoms was higher among nurses than among doctors (p < 0.01). The multivariate analysis revealed that nurses (odds ratio 8.29; p = 0.01) might be independently at risk of experiencing physical symptoms.

222,Severe COVID-19 patients display a back boost of seasonal coronavirus-specific antibodies,"Severe acquired respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In severe COVID-19 cases, higher antibody titers against seasonal coronaviruses have been observed than in mild cases. To investigate antibody cross-reactivity as potential explanation for severe disease, we determined the kinetics, breadth, magnitude and level of cross-reactivity of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal CoV nucleocapsid and spike from 17 severe COVID-19 cases at the clonal level. Although patients mounted a mostly type-specific SARS-CoV-2 response, B-cell clones directed against seasonal CoV dominated and strongly increased over time. Seasonal CoV IgG responses that did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 were boosted well beyond detectable cross-reactivity, particularly for HCoV-OC43 spike. These findings support a back-boost of poorly protective coronavirus-specific antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients that may negatively impact de novo SARS-CoV-2 immunity, reminiscent of original antigenic sin.",Brenda M.

223,Machine learning based prognostic model and mobile application software platform for predicting infection susceptibility of COVID-19 using health care data,"From public health perspectives of COVID-19 pandemic, accurate estimates of infection severity of individuals are extremely valuable for the informed decision making and targeted response to an emerging pandemic. This paper presents machine learning based prognostic model for providing early warning to the individuals for COVID-19 infection using the health care data set. In the present work, a prognostic model using Random Forest classifier and support vector regression is developed for predicting the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19 and it is applied on an open health care data set containing 27 field values. The typical fields of the health care data set include basic personal details such as age, gender, number of children in the household, marital status along with medical data like Coma score, Pulmonary score, Blood Glucose level, HDL cholesterol etc. An effective preprocessing method is carried out for handling the numerical, categorical values (non-numerical), missing data in the health care data set. The correlation between the variables in the health care data is analyzed using the correlation coefficient and heat map with a color code is used to identify the influencing factors on the Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. Based on the accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores, it is noted that the random forest classifier provides an improved classification performance as compared to Support vector regression for the given health care data set. Android based mobile application software platform is developed using the proposed prognostic approach for enabling the healthy individuals to predict the susceptibility infection score of COVID-19 to take the precautionary measures. Based on the results of the proposed method, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread

MethodsIn the present work, Random Forest classifier and support vector regression techniques are applied to a medical health care dataset containing 27 variables for predicting the susceptibility score of an individual towards COVID-19 infection and the accuracy of prediction is compared. An effective preprocessing is carried for handling the missing data in the health care data set. Correlation analysis using heat map is carried on the health care data for analyzing the influencing factors of Infection Susceptibility Probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. A confusion matrix is calculated for understanding the performance of classification of the based on the number of True-Positives, True-Negatives, False-Positives and False-Negatives. These values further used to calculate the accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and F-scores.

ResultsFrom the classification results, it is noted that the Random Forest classifier provides an classification accuracy of 99.7% precision of 99.8%, sensitivity of 98.8% and F-score of 99.29% for the given medical data set.

ConclusionProposed machine learning approach can help the individuals to take additional precautions for protecting people from the COVID-19 infection, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread.

224,"Identifying Optimal COVID-19 Testing Strategies for Schools and Businesses: Balancing Testing Frequency, Individual Test Technology, and Cost","BackgroundCOVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity have been widely examined and discussed yet optimal use of these tests will depend on the goals of testing, the population or setting, and the anticipated underlying disease prevalence. We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses.

MethodsWe coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, and test cost on outcomes case reduction.

ResultsIncreasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32.

ConclusionsA range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay. Sample pooling allowed for operational efficiency and cost savings with minimal loss of model performance.",Gregory D. Lyng; Natalie E. Sheils; Caleb J. Kennedy; Daniel Griffin; Ethan M.

We used a time-series analysis to discover how patterns of five indicators of mobility data relate to changes in Rt of 125 countries distributed over three groups based on Rt-mobility correlation. Group 1 included 71 countries in which Rt correlates negatively with residential and positively with other mobility indicators. Group 2 included 25 countries showing an opposite correlation pattern to Group 1. Group 3 included the 29 remaining countries. We chose the best-fit TL based on forecast and linear regression models. We used linear mixed models to evaluate how mobility indicators and the stringency index (SI) relate with Rt. SI reflects the strictness of governmental responses to COVID-19. With a median of 14 days, TLs varied across countries as well as across groups of countries. There was a strong negative correlation between SI and Rt in most countries belonging to Group 1 as opposed to Group 2. SI (units of 10%) associated with decreasing Rt in Group 1 [{beta} -0.15, 95% CI -0.15 - (-0.14)] and Group 3 [-0.05, -0.07 - (-0.03)], whereas, in Group 2, SI associated with increasing Rt (0.13, 0.11 - 0.16).

227,Summer School Holidays and the Growth Rate in Sars-CoV-2 Infections Across German Districts,"How significant are school holidays for the Covid-19 crisis? In this ecological study, we analyse the association between summer school holidays and the weekly growth rate in SARS-CoV-2 infections in 401 German districts. In Germany school holidays are coordinated between states and spread out in order to reduce the number and length of traffic jams on motorways. We employ a district fixed effects Chow-type structural break model specification in which we test whether the holiday season as well as the period of two weeks after holidays end result in a statistically significantly higher infection growth rate than the period of two weeks before holidays start, our presumed counterfactual. We also allow the effect to vary week-by-week and by states. We find that between 30 and 50 percent of the growth rate in new infections in Germany can be attributed to the holiday season. A significant increase in the growth of new infections begins approximately four weeks after holidays begin - that is, shortly after the first wave of holiday-makers return. The effect becomes stronger the further holidays proceed and does not revert back to normal in the two weeks after the end of holidays. States in the West of Germany tend to experience stronger effects than those in the East. Part of this finding is explained by another result, namely that we find significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a districts population.",Thomas Pluemper; Eric Neumayer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210773,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210773,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,True
228,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell signaling in lung vascular cells,"Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. So far, 30 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and nearly 1 million people have died because of COVID-19 worldwide, causing serious health, economical, and sociological problems. However, the mechanism of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human host cells has not been defined. The present study reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in lung vascular cells. The treatment of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells or human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Val16 - Gln690) at 10 ng/ml (0.13 nM) caused an activation of MEK phosphorylation. The activation kinetics was transient with a peak at 10 min. The recombinant protein that contains only the ACE2 receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Arg319 - Phe541), on the other hand, did not cause this activation. Consistent with the activation of cell growth signaling in lung vascular cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, pulmonary vascular walls were found to be thickened in COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.",Yuichiro J.

229,Codon pattern reveals SARS-CoV-2 to be a monomorphic strain that emerged through recombination of replicase and envelope alleles of bat and pangolin origin,"Viruses are dependent on the host tRNA pool, and an optimum codon usage pattern (CUP) is a driving force in its evolution. Systematic analysis of CUP of replicase (rdrp), spike, envelope (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid (N) encoding genes of SARS-CoV-2 from reported diverse lineages to suggest one-time host jump of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate into the human host. In contrast to human isolates, a high degree of variation in CUP of these genes suggests that bats, pangolins, and dogs are natural reservoirs of diverse strains. At the same time, our analysis suggests that dogs are not a source of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, CUP of rdrp displays conservation with two bat SARS isolates RaTG13 and RmYN02. CUP of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene is also conserved with bat and pangolin isolates with variations for a few amino acids. This suggests role allele replacement in these two genes involving SARS strains of least two hosts. At the same time, a relatively conserved CUP pattern in replicase and envelope across hosts suggests them it to be an ideal target in antiviral development for SARS-CoV-2.",Kanika Bansal; Prabhu B Patil,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335521,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335521,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False

We previously established unsupervised AI, a BLSOM (batch-learning SOM), which can analyze five million genomic sequences simultaneously. The present study applied the BLSOM to the oligonucleotide compositions of forty thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes. While only the oligonucleotide composition was given, the obtained clusters of genomes corresponded primarily to known main clades and internal divisions in the main clades.

Despite a low mutation rate, isolates with the D614G substitution in the S protein appeared early during the pandemic, and are now the dominant form worldwide. Here, we analyze the D614G mutation in the context of a soluble S ectodomain construct. Cryo-EM structures, antigenicity and proteolysis experiments suggest altered conformational dynamics resulting in enhanced furin cleavage efficiency of the G614 variant. Furthermore, furin cleavage altered the conformational dynamics of the Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) in the G614 S ectodomain, demonstrating an allosteric effect on the RBD dynamics triggered by changes in the SD2 region, that harbors residue 614 and the furin cleavage site. Our results elucidate SARS-CoV-2 spike conformational dynamics and allostery, and have implications for vaccine design.

234,Structural investigation of ACE2 dependent disassembly of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein,"The human membrane protein Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) acts as the main receptor for host cells invasion of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The viral surface glycoprotein Spike binds to hACE2, which triggers virus entry into cells. As of today, the role of hACE2 for virus fusion is not well understood. Blocking the transition of Spike from its prefusion to post-fusion state might be a strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19. Here we report a single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike in presence of the human ACE2 ectodomain. The binding of purified hACE2 ectodomain to Spike induces the disassembly of the trimeric form of Spike and a structural rearrangement of its S1 domain to form a stable, monomeric complex with hACE2. This observed hACE2 dependent dissociation of the Spike trimer suggests a mechanism for the therapeutic role of recombinant soluble hACE2 for treatment of COVID-19.",Dongchun Ni; Kelvin Lau; Frank Lehmann; Andri Fraenkli; David Hacker; Florence Pojer; Henning Stahlberg,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336016,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336016,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
235,Genomic Similarity of Nucleotides in SARS CoronaVirus using K-Means Unsupervised Learning Algorithm,"The drastic increase in the number of coronaviruses discovered and coronavirus genomes being sequenced have given us a great opportunity to perform genomics and bioinformatics analysis on this family of viruses. Coronaviruses possess the largest genomes (26.4 to 31.7 kb) among all known RNA viruses, with G + C contents varying from 32% to 43%. Phylogenetically, three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, with Betacoronavirus consisting of subgroups A, B, C were known to exist but now a new genus D also exists,namely the Deltacoronavirus. In such a situation, it becomes highly important for efficient classification of all virus data so that it helps us in suitable planning,containment and treatment. The objective of this paper is to classify SARS corona-virus nucleotide sequences based on parameters such as sequence length,percentage similarity between the sequence information,open and closed gaps in the sequence due to multiple mutations and many others.By doing this,we will be able to predict accurately the similarity of SARS CoV-2 virus with respect to other corona-viruses like the Wuhan corona-virus,the bat corona-virus and the pneumonia virus and would help us better understand about the taxonomy of the corona-virus family.

236,Sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 spike facilitate syncytia formation,"The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds the cell surface protein ACE2 to mediate fusion of the viral membrane with target cells1-4. S comprises a large external domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a short cytoplasmic tail5,6. To elucidate the intracellular trafficking of S protein in host cells we applied proteomics to identify cellular factors that interact with its cytoplasmic tail. We confirm interactions with components of the COPI, COPII and SNX27/retromer vesicle coats, and with FERM domain actin regulators and the WIPI3 autophagy component. The interaction with COPII promotes efficient exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and although COPI-binding should retain S in the early Golgi system where viral budding occurs, the binding is weakened by a suboptimal histidine residue in the recognition motif. As a result, S leaks to the surface where it accumulates as it lacks an endocytosis motif of the type found in many other coronaviruses7,8. It is known that when at the surface S can direct cell:cell fusion leading to the formation of multinucleate syncytia9-11. Thus, the trafficking signals in the cytoplasmic tail of S protein indicate that syncytia formation is not an inadvertent by-product of infection but rather a key aspect of the replicative cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and potential cause of pathological symptoms.",Jerome Cattin-Ortola; Lawrence Welch; Sarah L Maslen; J Mark Skehel; Guido Papa; Leo C James; Sean Munro,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335562,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335562,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
237,Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data,"The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities, known as multimodal analysis, represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates new computational methods that can define cellular states based on multiple data types. Here, we introduce  weighted-nearest neighbor analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.

238,Diagnostic Accuracy of FDA Authorized Serology Tests to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Importance: Serology tests are diagnostic and complementary to molecular tests during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data sources: A search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, and EMBASE up to April 4, 2020, was performed to identify studies using the ""COVID 19 testing"" and ""meta-analysis."" FDA website was accessed for the list of tests for emergency use authorization (EUA). Study Selection: Manufacturer reported serology tests published in the FDA website were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected reports. Data extraction and synthesis: The meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A bivariate analysis using the ""random-effects model"" was applied for pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the serology test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subgroup analysis of the diagnostic accuracy with lag time between symptom onset and testing were studied. Results: Seven manufacturer listed reports were included. The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI, 78% - 93%), the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI, 97% - 100%), and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97. At [&le;] 7 days, sensitivity was 44% (95% CI, 21% - 70%), and for 8-14 days, sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 67 % - 94%). For blood draws [&ge;] 15 days after the onset of symptoms, sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% - 98%). Heterogeneity was substantial, and the risk of bias was low in this analysis. Conclusions and relevance: FDA authorized serology tests demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection (certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test accuracy based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of evidence: low)",Rajesh Pandey; Anand Gourishankar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208553,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208553,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
239,Assessing the Impact of Area Deprivation Index on COVID-19 Prevalence: A Contrast Between Rural and Urban U.S. Jurisdictions,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities differentially, with poorer and minority populations being more adversely affected. Prior rural health research suggests such disparities may be exacerbated during the pandemic and in remote parts of the U.S. To understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the U.S., county level data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were examined by Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores and Metropolitan vs. Nonmetropolitan designations from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These designations were the basis for making comparisons between Urban and Rural jurisdictions. Kendalls Tau-B was used to compare effect sizes between jurisdictions on select ADI composites and well researched social determinants of health (SDH). Spearman coefficients and a moderation analysis using Poisson modeling was used to explore the relationship between ADI and COVID-19 prevalence in the context of county designation. Results show that the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence was positive and higher for rural counties, when compared to urban ones and that family income and poverty had a stronger relationship with prevalence than other ADI component measures. Though most Americans live in Metropolitan Areas, rural communities were found to be associated with a stronger relationship between deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence. Models for predicting COVID-19 prevalence by ADI and county type reinforced this observation but revealed no moderating effect of county type on ADI.",Christopher Kitchen; Elham Hatef; Hsien Yen Chang; Jonathan Weiner; Hadi Kharrazi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208462,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208462,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
240,Long-term COVID-19 symptoms in a large unselected population,"It is increasingly recognized that SARS-CoV-2 can produce long-term complications after recovery from the acute effects of infection. Here, we report the analysis of 32 self-reported short and long-term symptoms in a general adult population cohort comprised of 233 COVID-19+ cases, 3,652 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, and 17,474 non-tested individuals. The majority of our COVID-19+ cases are mild, with only 8 of the 233 COVID-19+ cases having been hospitalized. Our results show that 43.4% of COVID-19+ cases have symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, and 24.1% still have at least one symptom after 90 days. These numbers are higher for COVID-19+ cases who were initially more ill, 59.4% at 30 days and 40.6% at 90 days, but even for very mild and initially asymptomatic cases, 14.3% have complications persist for 30 days or longer. In contrast, only 8.6% of participants from the general untested population develop new symptoms lasting longer than 30 days due to any illness during the same study period. The long-term symptoms most enriched in those with COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnea, memory loss, confusion, headache, heart palpitations, chest pain, pain with deep breaths, dizziness, and tachycardia. We additionally observe that individuals who had an initial symptom of dyspnea are significantly more likely to develop long-term symptoms. Importantly, our study finds that the overall level of illness is an important variable to account for when assessing the statistical significance of symptoms that are associated with COVID-19. Our study provides a baseline from which to understand the frequency of COVID-19 long-term symptoms at the population level and demonstrates that, although those most likely to develop long-term COVID-19 complications are those who initially have more severe illness, even those with mild or asymptomatic courses of infection are at increased risk of long-term complications.",Elizabeth Cirulli; Kelly M Schiabor Barrett; Stephen Riffle; Alexandre Bolze; Iva Neveux; Shaun Dabe; Joseph J Grzymski; James T Lu; Nicole L Washington,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208702,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208702,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True

242,Lockdown impact on age-specific contact patterns and behaviours in France,"In the first trimester 2020, a significant number of countries implemented general lockdowns of their populations to contain the quickly expanding SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and avoid major saturation of health care capacity. Understanding how these unprecedented measures impacted population behaviour and contact patterns is key to predict more accurately the health, social and economic impacts of such extreme actions if they were to be applied to future outbreaks. We set up an online survey to measure how the lockdown affected social contact patterns in France, and collected information from 42,036 participants aged 18 years and over between April 10 and April 28, 2020. Among the participants who normally worked outside home prior to the lockdown (72% of the survey population), 68% reported that they had moved to working from home and 17% reported being unemployed during the lockdown. Only 2% of participants used public transport during lockdown, as opposed to 37% before it. Participants reported increased frequency of washing hands, switch in greeting behaviour, but generally limited use of masks outside home. 138,934 contacts were reported, with an average 3.3 contacts per individual per day (1.7 for individuals aged >65 years old compared to 3.6 for younger age-groups). This represented a 70% reduction compared with previous surveys, consistent with reductions in transmission rates measured during the lockdown. Contacts in workplaces, shops, and transports on the previous day were respectively reported in only 11%, 31% and 0.5% of the participants. For those who maintained a professional activity outside home, the frequency of contacts at work dropped by 79%. This study shows that the lockdown dramatically affected population's behavior, work, risk perception and contact patterns. Both frequency and heterogeneity of contacts were affected, impacting potential important features of virus dissemination. Such surveys are essential to evaluate more accurately the impact of past or future lockdowns and anticipate epidemic dynamics in these conditions.",Paolo Bosetti; Bich-Tram Huynh; Armiya Youssouf Abdou; Marie Sanchez; Catherine Eisenhauer; Noémie Courtejoie; Jérôme Accardo; Henrik Salje; Didier Guillemot; Mathieu Moslonka-Lefebvre; Pierre-Yves Boëlle; Guillaume Béraud; Simon Cauchemez; Lulla Opatowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20205104,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20205104,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
243,DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING COVID-19 ADVERSE OUTCOME RISK PREDICTION MODELS FROM A BI-NATIONAL EUROPEAN COHORT OF 5594 PATIENTS.,"Background: Patients with severe COVID-19 have overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. We hypothesized that Machine Learning (ML) models could be used to predict risks at different stages of management (at diagnosis, hospital admission and ICU admission) and thereby provide insights into drivers and prognostic markers of disease progression and death. Methods: From a cohort of approx. 2.6 million citizens in the two regions of Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed on subjects suspected for COVID-19 disease; 3944 cases had at least one positive test and were subjected to further analysis. A cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases from the United Kingdom Biobank was used for external validation. Findings: The ML models predicted the risk of death (Receiver Operation Characteristics Area Under the Curve, ROC-AUC) of 0.904 at diagnosis, 0.818, at hospital admission and 0.723 at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Similar metrics were achieved for predicted risks of hospital and ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation. We identified some common risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension as driving factors, although the top risk features shifted towards markers of shock and organ dysfunction in ICU patients. The external validation indicated fair predictive performance for mortality prediction, but suboptimal performance for predicting ICU admission. Interpretation: ML may be used to identify drivers of progression to more severe disease and for prognostication patients in patients with COVID-19. Prognostic features included age, BMI and hypertension, although markers of shock and organ dysfunction became more important in more severe cases. We provide access to an online risk calculator based on these findings.",Espen Jimenez Solem; Tonny Studsgaard Petersen; Christina Lioma; Christian Igel; Wouter Boomsma; Oswin Krause; Casper Hansen; Christian Hansen; Stephan Lorentzen; Raghavendra Selvan; Janne Petersen; Martin Erik Nyeland; Mikkel Zoellner Ankarfeldt; Gert Mehl Virenfeldt; Mathilde Winther-Jensen; Allan Linneberg; Mostafa Mediphour Ghazi; Nicki Detlefsen; Andreas Lauritzen; Abraham George Smith; Marleen de Bruijne; Bulat Ibragimov; Jens Petersen; Martin Lillholm; Marie Helleberg; Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen; Jon Middleton; Stine Hasling Mogensen; Hans Christian Thorsen-Meyer; Anders Perner; Mikkel Bonde; Alexander Bonde; Akshay Pai; Mads Nielsen; Martin Sillesen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207209,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207209,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True

245,Prevalence and Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Healthcare Workers: A Single Center Study,"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence as a marker of prior infection in a spectrum of healthcare workers (HCWs) may guide risk stratification and enactment of better health policies and procedures. The present study reported on cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, between May and August, 2020. Data from HCWs (n=3,458) were included in the analysis. Data from first responders (n=226) were also analyzed for comparison. A blood sample was collected at study enrollment and 8-week follow-up. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Comparisons to estimated community prevalence were also evaluated. Observed antibody prevalence was 0.93% and 2.58% at initial and 8-week follow-up, respectively, for HCWs, and 5.31% and 4.35% for first responders. For HCWs, significant differences (p < .05) between negative vs. positive at initial assessment were found for age, race, fever, and loss of smell, and at 8-week follow-up for age, race, and all symptoms. Antibody positivity persisted at least 8 weeks in this cohort. Among 75 HCWs with self-reported prior PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 35 (46.7%) were antibody negative. Significant differences between negative vs. positive were observed in age and frequency of symptoms. This study found considerably lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among HCWs compared with prior published studies. This may be explained by better safety measures in the workplace, heightened awareness inside and outside of the workplace, possibly lower susceptibility due to innate immunity and other biological heterogeneity, and low COVID-19 prevalence in the community itself. HCWs with initial positive results had persistent positive serologies at 8 weeks. Further research is warranted to investigate factors influencing such lower prevalence in our HCWs.",Michael Brant-Zawadzki; Deborah Fridman; Philip Robinson; Matthew Zahn; Clayton Chau; Randy German; Marcus Breit; Elmira Burke; Jason R.

246,District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India,"Abstract Background The number of patients with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has amplified in India. Understanding the district level correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio (IR) is essential for formulating policies and intervention. Objectives The present study examines the association between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of India's population and the COVID-19 infection ratio at the district level. Data and Methods Using crowdsourced data on the COVID-19 prevalence rate, we analyzed state and district level variation in India from March 14 to July 31, 2020. We identified hotspot and cold spot districts for COVID-19 cases and infection ratio. We have also carried out a regression analysis to highlight the district level demographic, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and health-related correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio. Results The results showed that the IR is 42.38 per one hundred thousand population in India. The highest IR was observed in Andhra Pradesh (145.0), followed by Maharashtra (123.6), and was the lowest in Chhattisgarh (10.1). About 80 percent of infected cases and 90 percent of deaths were observed in nine Indian states (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Gujarat). Moreover, we observed COVID-19 cold-spots in central, northern, western, and north-eastern regions of India. Out of 736 districts, six metropolitan cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Thane, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad) emerged as the major hotspots in India, containing around 30 percent of confirmed total COVID-19 cases in the country. Simultaneously, parts of the Konkan coast in Maharashtra, part of Delhi, the southern part of Tamil Nadu, the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir were identified as hotspots of COVID-19 infection. Moran's- I value of 0.333showed a positive spatial clustering level in the COVID-19 IR case over neighboring districts. Our regression analysis found that district-level population density ({beta}: 0.05, CI:004-0.06), the percent of urban population ({beta}:3.08, CI: 1.05-5.11), percent of Scheduled Caste Population ({beta}: 3.92, CI: 0.12-7.72),and district-level testing ratio ({beta}: 0.03, CI: 0.01-0.04) are positively associated with the prevalence of COVID-19. Conclusion COVID-19 cases were heavily concentrated in 9 states of India. Several demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables are correlated with the COVID-19 prevalence rate. However, after adjusting the role of socioeconomic and health-related factors, the COVID-19 infection rate was found to be more rampant in districts with a higher population density, a higher percentage of the urban population, and a higher percentage of deprived castes and with a higher level of testing ratio. The identified hotspots and correlates in this study give crucial information for policy discourse.

This study aims to provide preliminary information about the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases among students attending Italian schools. Methods Data are extracted and analysed from an open access, online dataset that monitor, on a daily basis, media news about SARS-CoV-2 infections of students attending Italian schools. Results As of 5 October 2020, a total of 1350 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been registered in the Italian territory schools (involving 1059 students, 145 teachers and 146 other school members), for a total of 1212 out of 65104 (1.8%) Italian schools involved. National schools reported only 1 case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in more than 90% of cases, and only in one high school a cluster of more than 10 cases have been described (P 0.015). The detection of one or more SARS-CoV-2 infections leaded to the closure of 192 (14.2%) entire schools, more frequently nursery/kindergartens (P <0.0005). Discussion Our preliminary data support low transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within schools, at least among younger students. However, entire schools are frequently closed in the fear of larger outbreaks. Continuous monitoring of school settings, hopefully through daily updated open access datasets, are needed to better understand the impact of schools on the pandemic, and provide guidelines that better consider different risks within different age groups.",Danilo Buonsenso; Cristina De Rose; Rosanna Moroni; Piero Valentini,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20210328,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20210328,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True

Design: A Clinical trial registry of India registered observational study (CTRI/2020/05/025247). Setting: Certified COVID hospital located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Participants: 549 COVID positive patients hospitalized between 15 th May to 10 th August, 2020 and treated in ICU and non ICU settings. Main Outcome Measure: Comparative analysis of demographic, clinical characteristics, investigations, treatment, complications and outcome of COVID patients in ICU and non ICU settings. Results: Of the 549 hospitalized COVID positive patients, 159 were admitted in ICU during disease course while 390 had ward admissions. Overall median age was 52 (1-86) years. The ICU group was older (>65years), with associated comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes (p<0.001); higher proportion of males (79.25%); with dyspnea as a major clinical characteristic and consolidation in lungs as a major radiological finding as compared to ward patients. C - reactive protein, D-Dimer and Ferritin were higher in ICU patients. Overall 50% females depicted elevated Ferritin levels. Steriods(92.45%)and tocilizumab (69.18%) were more frequently used for ICU patients . Remdesivir was prescribed to both ICU and non ICU patients. Favirapir was also a line of treatment for 25% of ICU patients. Convalescent plasma therapy was given to 7 ICU patients. Complications like acute kidney injury (13.84%), shock (10.69 %), sepsis and encephalopathy were observed in ICU patients. Overall mortality rate was 5.47 % with higher mortality among males in comparison to females (p<0.0001).

A more detailed analysis was undertaken of a subset of patients admitted across three Respiratory Units in the trust. Results: Increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 67% of survivors, with 42% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms. Conclusions: Understanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be vital in preparing for further peaks of the pandemic. Our initial follow up data suggest there are ongoing sequalae of COVID-19 including persistent symptoms and radiological abnormalities. Further data, including longer term follow up data, are necessary to improve our understanding of this novel pathogen and associated disease.",Daryl Cheng; Claire Calderwood; Erik Skyllberg; Adam Ainley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20193623,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20193623,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
250,Risk of death during the 2020 UK COVID-19 epidemic among people with rare autoimmune diseases compared to the general population. Preliminary results from the RECORDER project.,"Objectives: To quantify the risk of death among people with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) during the UK 2020 COVID-19 epidemic compared with baseline risk and the risk of death in the general population during COVID-19. Design A cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). We used ONS published data for general population mortality rates. Setting: Hospital Episode Statistics for England 2003 onwards, and linked data from the NHS Personal Demographics Service. Participants: 168,691 people with RAIRD who were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. Our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%. Main outcome measure: Age-standardised mortality rates for all-cause death. Secondary outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality rates. Results: 1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4-3838.1 per 100,000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of England it was 1.38 times higher. Compared to the general population, the age-specific mortality rates in people with RAIRD compared to the pre-COVID rates were higher from the age of 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk began from age 55 upwards. Sex-specific rates were similar in males and females, whereas in the general population females had a lower rate than males. Conclusions: The risk of all-cause death is more prominently raised during COVID-19 among people with RAIRD than among the general population. We urgently need to quantify how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how much is due to disruption to healthcare services, in order to inform better guidance about shielding, access to healthcare and vaccine priorities for people with rare diseases.",Emily J Peach; Megan Rutter; Peter C Lanyon; Matthew J Grainge; Richard B Hubbard; Jeanette Aston; Mary Bythell; Sarah Stevens; Fiona A Pearce,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210237,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210237,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
251,Extended laboratory panel testing in the Emergency Department for risk-stratification of patients with COVID-19: a single centre retrospective service evaluation,"Background The role of specific blood tests to predict poor prognosis in patients admitted with infection from SARS-CoV2 virus remains uncertain. During the first wave of the global pandemic, an extended laboratory testing panel was integrated into the local pathway to guide triage and healthcare resource utilisation for emergency admissions. We conducted a retrospective service evaluation to determine the utility of extended tests (D-dimer, ferritin, high-sensitivity troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin) compared to the core panel (full blood count, urea & electrolytes, liver function tests, C-reactive protein). Methods Clinical outcomes for adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted between 17th March to 30st June 2020 were extracted, alongside costs estimates for individual tests. Prognostic performance was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis with 28-day mortality used as the primary endpoint, and a composite of 28-day intensive care escalation or mortality for secondary analysis. Results From 13,500 emergency attendances we identified 391 unique adults admitted with COVID-19. Of these, 113 died (29%) and 151 (39%) reached the composite endpoint. Core test variables adjusted for age, gender and index of deprivation had a prognostic AUC of 0.79 (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.67 to 0.91) for mortality and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84) for the composite endpoint. Addition of extended test components did not improve upon this. Conclusion Our findings suggest use of the extended laboratory testing panel to risk stratify community-acquired COVID-19-positive patients on admission adds limited prognostic value.

252,Age-targeted dose allocation can halve COVID-19 vaccine requirements,"In anticipation of COVID-19 vaccine deployment, we use an age-structured mathematical model to investigate the benefits of optimizing age-specific dose allocation to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Across 179 countries, we find that the highest priority individuals are typically those between 30 and 59 years of age because of their high contact rates and higher risk of infection and disease. We reaffirm that vaccination alone may be insufficient to achieve herd immunity in some settings, and that additional intervention measures may be required.

253,Exclusion of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 using baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotics,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is infrequently complicated by secondary bacterial infection, but nevertheless antibiotic prescriptions are common. We used community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a benchmark to define the processes that occur in a bacterial pulmonary infection, and tested the hypothesis that baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotic therapy could distinguish CAP from COVID-19.

MethodsIn patients admitted to Royal Free Hospital (RFH) and Barnet Hospital (BH) we defined CAP by lobar consolidation on chest radiograph, and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. Data were derived from routine laboratory investigations.

ResultsOn admission all CAP and >90% COVID-19 patients received antibiotics. We identified 106 CAP and 619 COVID-19 patients at RFH. CAP was characterised by elevated white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to COVID-19 (median WCC 12.48 (IQR 8.2-15.3) vs 6.78 (IQR 5.2-9.5) x106 cells/ml and median CRP CRP 133.5 (IQR 65-221) vs 86 (IQR 42-160) mg/L). Blood samples collected 48-72 hours into admission revealed decreasing CRP in CAP but not COVID-19 (CRP difference -33 (IQR -112 to +3.5) vs +15 (IQR -15 to +70) mg/L respectively). In the independent validation cohort (BH) consisting of 169 CAP and 181 COVID-19 patients, admission WCC >8.2x106 cells/ml or falling CRP during admission identified 95% of CAP cases, and predicted the absence of bacterial co-infection in 45% of COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsWe propose that in COVID-19 the absence of both elevated baseline WCC and antibiotic-related decrease in CRP can exclude bacterial co-infection and facilitate antibiotic stewardship efforts.",Claire Y Mason; Tanmay Kanitkar; Charlotte J Richardson; Marisa Lanzman; Zak Stone; Tabitha Mahungu; Damien Mack; Emmanuel Q Wey; Lucy Lamb; Indran Balakrishnan; Gabriele Pollara,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20199778,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20199778,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
254,SARS-CoV-2 genomic characterization and clinical manifestation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay,"COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and declared by the World Health Organization as a global public health emergency. Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation.

255,"Factors associated with progression to critical illness in 28 days among COVID-19 patients: results from a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul, Turkey","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread worldwide to become a pandemic. This study aimed to define the predictors of critical illness development within 28 days postadmission. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study including 477 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul from March 12 to May 12, 2020. The development of critical illness, e.g., invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death, was followed for a period of 28 days postadmission. Demographic characteristics, number of comorbidities, illness severity at admission defined by the WHO scale, vital signs, laboratory findings and period of admission to the hospital were independent variables. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed, and the C-index was calculated. Results The median (IQR) age of the cohort was 55.0 (44.0-67.0) years, and 50.1% were male. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, dyspnea and fatigue. Overall, 65.2% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Hydroxychloroquine was given to 99.2% of the patients. Critical illness developed in 45 (9.4%; 95% CI: 7.0%-12.4%) patients. In the multivariable analysis, age (HR: 1.05, p<0.001), number of comorbidities (HR: 1.33, p=0.02), procalcitonin [&ge;]0.25 g/L (HR: 2.12, p=0.03) and LDH [&ge;]350 U/L (HR: 2.04, p=0.03) were independently associated with critical illness development.

256,Low zinc levels at clinical admission associates with poor outcomes in COVID-19,"Background: Biomarkers to predict Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcome early at infection are urgently needed to improve prognosis and treatment. Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two groups with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression and thus might represent a useful biomarker. Methods: We run a retrospective observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel we have studied SARS-CoV2 replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations. Findings: Our study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 mcgg/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV2 infected cells. Interpretation: SZC is a novel biomarker to predict COVID-19 outcome.

257,"Enoxaparin is associated with lower rates of thrombosis, kidney injury, and mortality than Unfractionated Heparin in hospitalized COVID patients","Although anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, e.g. enoxaparin) are both being used for therapeutic mitigation of COVID associated coagulopathy (CAC), differences in their clinical outcomes remain to be investigated. Here, we employ automated neural networks supplemented with expert curation (Augmented Curation) for retrospectively analyzing the complete electronic health records (EHRs) of 671 hospitalized COVID-19 patients administered either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, but not both. We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have higher rates of mortality (risk ratio: 2.6; 95% C.I.: [1.2-5.4]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.09), thrombotic events (risk ratio: 5.7, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024), acute kidney injury (risk ratio: 5.5; 95% C.I.: [1.2-17.7]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.10), and bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio undefined; 95% C.I.: [1.0, 292]; p-value:0.02; BH adjusted p-value:0.10), compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin. Notably, even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, initial ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support, the above differences between the enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin patient cohorts remain statistically significant.

258,"Polyester Nasal Swabs Collected in a Dry Tube are a Robust and Inexpensive, Minimal Self-Collection Kit for SARS-CoV-2 Testing","Background Polyester nasal swabs stored in saline or in a dry tube were evaluated as an alternative to foam nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) since they may be inexpensively manufactured at high capacity. Methods Surrogate clinical specimens were prepared by inoculating foam and polyester nasal swabs with residual SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens diluted in porcine or human matrix. Dry swab elution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was evaluated by vortex, swab swirling, and passive methodologies. Surrogate and clinical nasal specimen stability were evaluated at refrigerated (4C) and elevated temperatures (40C for 12 hours, 32C hold) through 72 hours. Results Polyester swabs demonstrated equivalent performance to foam swabs for detection of low and high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Dry swab elution performed with PBS and mechanical disruption by vortex resulted in nearly complete quantitative recovery of virus. Dry polyester and foam surrogate specimens were stable through 72 hours both when refrigerated and after high temperature excursion, which simulated specimen transport without cold chain. Similarly, clinical specimens collected with polyester swabs and stored dry were stable through 72 hours in the presence and absence of cold chain. Polyester surrogate specimens stored in saline were stable through 72 hours refrigerated but only through 48 hours at elevated temperatures.

259,Evaluating the Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Rates on College Campuses to Wastewater Surveillance,"As college campuses reopen, we are in the midst of a large-scale experiment on the efficacy of various strategies to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Traditional individual surveillance testing via nasal swabs and/or saliva is among the measures that colleges are pursuing to reduce the spread of the virus on campus. Additionally, some colleges are testing wastewater on their campuses for signs of infection, which can provide an early warning signal for campuses to locate COVID-positive individuals. However, a representation of wastewater surveillance has not yet been incorporated into epidemiological models for college campuses, nor has the efficacy of wastewater screening been evaluated relative to traditional individual surveillance testing, within the structure of these models. Here, we implement a new model component for wastewater surveillance within an established epidemiological model for college campuses. We use a hypothetical residential university to evaluate the efficacy of wastewater surveillance to maintain low infection rates. We find that wastewater sampling with a 1-day lag to initiate individual screening tests, plus completing the subsequent tests within a 4-day period can keep overall infections within 5% of the infection rates seen with traditional individual surveillance testing. Our results also indicate that wastewater surveillance can be an effective way to dramatically reduce the number of false positive cases by identifying subpopulations for surveillance testing where infectious individuals are more likely to be found. Through a Monte Carlo risk analysis, we find that surveillance testing that relies solely on wastewater sampling can be fragile against scenarios with high viral reproductive numbers and high rates of infection of campus community members by outside sources. These results point to the practical importance of additional surveillance measures to limit the spread of the virus on campus and the necessity of a proactive response to the initial signs of outbreak.

Author SummaryCollege campuses have employed a variety of measures to keep their communities safe amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Many colleges are implementing surveillance testing programs wherein students are randomly selected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2. These strategies aim to manage the number of infections among the student population by isolating infected individuals. Some colleges are monitoring wastewater on their campuses for signs of the virus, which has been found to be capable of detecting viral RNA. If a wastewater sample shows signs of viral RNA, then screening tests are administered to the individuals who live or work in the buildings that contribute to the sewer in question. We present a model for such wastewater surveillance within a larger model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on a college campus. We show that wastewater surveillance can reduce the number of false positive cases and the associated disruptions to student life, while maintaining similar overall numbers of infections. However, we find that surveillance testing strategies that rely solely on wastewater sampling may be less effective if the local transmission rate of the virus is high, or if the rate of infection of members of the campus community by outside sources is high.",Tony E Wong; George M Thurston; Nathaniel Barlow; Nathan Cahill; Lucia Carichino; Kara Maki; David Ross; Jennifer Schneider,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210245,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210245,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
260,Epidemiology of sleep disorders during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic scoping review,"BackgroundA growing burden of mental health problems has become a global concern amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Sleep disorders are major mental health problems associated with increased psychosocial stressors; however, no research synthesis is available on the epidemiology of it. In this systematic scoping review, we aimed to assess the current evidence on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature.

MethodSeven major health databases and additional sources were searched to identify, evaluate, and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available interventions. The Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review were used, and the findings were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist.

ResultsA total of 78 articles were retrieved, the prevalence of sleeping disorders ranged from 2.3% to 76.6%. Age, sex, level of education, physical and mental health, COVID-19 related factors, occupation especially being health care workers (HCW) were the main associated factors. Only two intentions were identified to address the issue.

ConclusionThe finding of this review indicated a high burden of sleep disorder with limited interventions that necessitate informing policymakers and practitioners to facilitate future research and implementations.

Brief summaryO_ST_ABSCurrent Knowledge/Study RationaleC_ST_ABSDespite the paramount importance of sleep for the physical and mental wellbeing of individuals, sleep hygiene is often neglected which resulted in a high prevalence of sleep disorders across the globe.

261,When lockdown policies amplify social inequalities in COVID-19 infections. Evidence from a cross-sectional population-based survey in France.,"ObjectivesTo assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown

DesignA cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown.

Participants10 401 participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19.

Main outcomeThe main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than three days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown.

ResultsIn all, 1,304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0%-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8% to 4.3%, P=0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9% before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P=0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being contaminated during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57% among working class individuals (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.0-2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29).

InterpretationLockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.

Section 1: What is already known on this topicSignificant differences in COVID-19 incidence by gender, class and race/ethnicity are recorded in many countries in the world. Lockdown measures implemented throughout the globe have been effective in reducing transmission risks.

Section 2: What this study addsOur study shows that lockdowns impact was socially differentiated and has benefited the working classes the least. Such results underline the need to design COVID-19 preventive policies that take into account living and working conditions, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.",Nathalie BAJOS,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208595,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208595,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
262,Global projections of potential lives saved from COVID-19 through universal mask use,"BackgroundSocial distancing mandates have been effective at reducing the health impacts of COVID-19. The ensuing economic downturns and unemployment increases have led many nations to progressively relax mandates. As COVID-19 transmission and deaths rise in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuing widespread transmission elsewhere, policymakers are searching for options to reduce COVID-19 mortality without re-imposing strict social distancing mandates.

MethodsUsing a Bayesian meta-regression of 40 studies measuring the impact of mask use on respiratory viral infections, we estimated the reduction in transmission associated with the use of cloth or paper masks used in a general population setting. We used data from daily surveys conducted by Facebook, YouGov, and Premise, on the proportion of people reporting always wearing a mask outside their home for nearly all countries. We predicted deaths and infections until January 1st 2021 under a reference and universal mask use scenario using a deterministic transmission dynamics model with categories for susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR). In the reference scenario, we assume continued easing of mandates but with action to re-impose mandates for a period of six weeks, at a level of eight daily deaths per million population. The universal mask scenario assumed scaling up of mask use to 95% over a one-week period.

FindingsUse of simple masks can reduce transmission of COVID-19 by 40% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 20% - 54%). Universal mask use would lead to a reduction of 815,600 deaths (95% UI 430,600 to 1,491,000 deaths) between August 26th 2020 and January 1st 2021, the difference between the predicted 3.00 million deaths (95% UI 2.20 to 4.52 million) in the reference and 2.18 million deaths (95% UI 1.71 to 3.14 million) in the universal mask scenario over this time period. Mask use was estimated at 59.0% of people globally on August 18th, ranging from 41.9% in North Africa and the Middle East to 79.2% in Latin America and the Caribbean. The effect of universal mask use is greatest in countries such as India (158,832 fewer deaths in universal mask scenario, 95% UI 75,152 to 282,838 deaths), the United States of America (93,495 fewer deaths; 95% UI 59,329 to 150,967 deaths), and Russia (68,531 fewer deaths; 95% UI 34,249 to 145,960 deaths).

InterpretationThe rising toll of the COVID-19 pandemic can be substantially reduced by the universal adoption of masks. This low-cost policy, whether customary or mandated, has enormous health benefits and likely large economic benefits as well, by delaying the need for re-imposition of social distancing mandates.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOne meta-analysis of 21 studies reported a pooled reduction in the risk of respiratory virus infection of 47% (95% CI 36-79%) from a subset of eight studies reporting on mask use in non-health workers but it did not distinguish type of mask. Another meta-analysis reported on 26 studies of mask use in health workers and three studies in non-healthcare settings, reported a pooled effect of a 66% (55-74%) reduction in infections and a reduction by 44% (21-60%) in the three non-healthcare setting studies. Several survey series regularly measure self-reported mask use but results from these different sources have not previously been pooled to derive daily estimates of mask use over the course of the epidemic. Global models of the impact of scaled up mask use have to our knowledge not been published.

Added value of this studyWe combined the studies on mask use identified in the two meta-analyses and added one further study. In a Bayesian meta-regression approach, we derived the effect of simple cloth or paper masks used outside of a healthcare setting. In the meta-regression we make use of all the information provided by all of these studies, rather than subsetting to just those studies that provided the direct comparison of interest. Pooling estimates on the prevalence of self-reported mask use from three survey series provides up-to-date information on trends in mask use in almost all countries. We use extensive survey data covering nearly every country in the world to assess recent trends and current mask use. We then use an SEIR transmission dynamics model with good predictive validity to assess the potential of scaled up mask use to reduce global mortality from COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidenceUniversal mask use can save many lives and avoid or, at least, delay the need for re-imposition of social mandates (such as stay-at-home orders, curfews, etc.), which would also contribute to ameliorating the negative effects of COVID-19 on the economy and unemployment. Until an affordable vaccine becomes universally available, mandating mask use is the most attractive policy option available to all countries, particularly if an expected increased transmission risk occurs in the Northern hemispheres fall and winter. Simple face coverings are cheap and effective; one of the few available interventions that is widely available to everyone. Countries with currently low mask use will need to determine the optimal balance between encouraging the use of masks through advocacy and information about their benefits, and governance of a compulsory use associated with penalties for non-compliance.",Emmanuela Gakidou; - IHME COVID-19 Forecasting Team,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209510,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209510,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,True
263,Development of wastewater pooled surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 from congregate living settings,"Wastewater-based monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 holds promise as tool to inform public health-decision making. Testing at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of preventing early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Sample collection protocols were developed and refined during preliminary sampling from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Optimized sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n=105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. However, if the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive then the sensitivity would be 95.2% but the specificity would drop to 52%. We determined a highly sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 shedding in building wastewater however our methods could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future work must focus on methods to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to widely deploy this promising wastewater surveillance tool.",Lisa M Colosi; Katie E Barry; Shireen M Kotay; Michael D Porter; Melinda D Poulter; Cameron Ratliff; William Simmons; Rena G Morse; Limor I Steinberg; D.

264,Single-dose intranasal administration of AdCOVID elicits systemic and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in mice,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.",Rodney G. King; Aaron Silva-Sanchez; Jessica N.

265,The landscape of antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2,"The search for potential antibody-based diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has focused almost exclusively on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins1-8. Coronavirus membrane (M), orf3a, and orf8 proteins are also humoral immunogens in other coronaviruses (CoVs)8-11 but remain largely uninvestigated for SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust antibody responses to epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, particularly in M, in which one epitope achieved near-perfect diagnostic accuracy. We map 79 B cell epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies appear to bind homologous peptide sequences in the 6 known human CoVs. Our results demonstrate previously unknown, highly reactive B cell epitopes throughout the full proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV proteins, especially M, which should be considered in diagnostic, vaccine, and therapeutic development.",Anna S Heffron; Sean J McIlwain; David A Baker; Maya F Amjadi; Saniya Khullar; Ajay K Sethi; Miriam A Shelef; Irene M Ong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334292,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334292,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,False
266,The human brain vasculature shows a distinct expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors,"A large number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients show neurological symptoms such as ischemic- and hemorrhagic stroke as well as encephalitis, and SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect endothelial cells leading to endotheliitis across multiple vascular beds. These findings suggest an involvement of the brain- and peripheral vasculature in COVID-19, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 tropism for brain vasculature, we constructed a molecular atlas of the expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry-associated genes (receptors and proteases) and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners in human (and mouse) adult and fetal brain as well as in multiple non-CNS tissues in single-cell RNA-sequencing data across various datasets. We observed a distinct expression pattern of the cathepsins B (CTSB) and -L (CTSL) - which are able to substitute for the ACE2 co-receptor TMPRSS2 - in the human vasculature with CTSB being mainly expressed in the brain vasculature and CTSL predominantly in the peripheral vasculature, and these observations were confirmed at the protein level in the Human Protein Atlas and using immunofluorescence stainings. This expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viral-entry associated proteases and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners was also present in endothelial cells and microglia in the fetal brain, suggesting a developmentally established SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery in the human vasculature. At both the adult and fetal stages, we detected a distinct pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes transcripts in brain vascular endothelial cells and microglia, providing a potential explanation for an inflammatory response in the brain endothelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, CTSB was co-expressed in adult and fetal brain endothelial cells with genes and pathways involved in innate immunity and inflammation, angiogenesis, blood-brain-barrier permeability, vascular metabolism, and coagulation, providing a potential explanation for the role of brain endothelial cells in clinically observed (neuro)vascular symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Our study serves as a publicly available single-cell atlas of SARS-CoV-2 related entry factors and interaction partners in human and mouse brain endothelial- and perivascular cells, which can be employed for future studies in clinical samples of COVID-19 patients.",Moheb Ghobrial; Jason Charish; Shigeki Takada; Taufik Valiante; Philippe Monnier; Ivan Radovanovic; Gary Bader; Thomas Waelchli,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334664,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.334664,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,,False
267,Kidney injury molecule-1 is a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 patients present high incidence of kidney abnormalities, which are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism and direct infection. Presently, it is generally recognized that SARS-CoV-2 initiates invasion through binding of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to host cell-membrane receptor ACE2, however, whether there is additional target of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney remains unclear. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1) is a transmembrane protein that drastically up-regulated after renal injury. Here, binding between SARS-CoV2-RBD and the extracellular Ig V domain of KIM1 was identified by molecular simulations and co-immunoprecipitation, which was comparable in affinity to that of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, KIM1 facilitated cell entry of SARS-CoV2-RBD, which was potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide. Together, the findings suggest KIM1 may mediate and exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in a  vicious cycle, and KIM1 could be further explored as a therapeutic target.",Chen Yang; Yu Zhang; Hong Chen; Yuchen Chen; Dong Yang; ZiWei Shen; Xiaomu Wang; Xinran Liu; Mingrui Xiong; Kun Huang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334052,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334052,2020-10-10,2020-10-10,,False
268,Soluble Spike DNA vaccine provides long-term protective immunity against SAR-CoV-2 in mice and nonhuman primates,"The unprecedented and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has motivated the need for a rapidly producible and scalable vaccine. Here, we developed a synthetic soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) DNA-based vaccine candidate, GX-19. In mice, immunization with GX-19 elicited not only S-specific systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but also Th1-biased T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. GX-19 vaccinated nonhuman primate seroconverted rapidly and exhibited detectable neutralizing antibody response as well as multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Notably, when the immunized nonhuman primates were challenged at 10 weeks after the last vaccination with GX-19, they did not develop fever and reduced viral loads in contrast to non-vaccinated primates as a control. These findings indicate that GX-19 vaccination provides durable protective immune response and also support further development of GX-19 as a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 in human clinical trials.",Yong Bok Seo; You Suk Suh; Ji In Ryu; Hwanhee Jang; Hanseul Oh; Bon-Sang Koo; Sang-Hwan Seo; Jung Joo Hong; Manki Song; Sung-Joo Kim; Young Chul Sung,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334136,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.334136,2020-10-10,2020-10-10,,False
269,SARS-CoV-2 Elicits Robust Adaptive Immune Responses Regardless of Disease Severity,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently prevails worldwide. To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, >99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity. These data support the possibility of achieving protective immunity through natural infection and bode well for the prospects of inducing immunological memory through vaccination.",Stine Sofie Frank Nielsen; Line K Vibholm; Ida Monrad; Rikke Olesen; Giacomo S Frattari; Marie H Pahus; Jesper F Højen; Jesper D Gunst; Christian Erikstrup; Andreas Holleufer; Rune Hartmann; Lars Østergaard; Ole S Søgaard; Mariane H Schleimann; Martin Tolstrup,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.331645,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.331645,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
270,Remote home monitoring (virtual wards) during the COVID-19 pandemic: a living systematic review,"Objectives: The aim of this review was to analyse the implementation and impact of remote home monitoring models (virtual wards) during COVID-19, identifying their main components, processes of implementation, target patient populations, impact on outcomes, costs and lessons learnt. The review will be kept live through regular updates. Design: The review was designed as a living systematic review to capture a rapidly evolving evidence base. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Setting: The review included remote home monitoring models led by primary and secondary care across seven countries. Participants: 17 examples of remote home monitoring models were included in the review. Main outcome measures: Impact of remote home monitoring on virtual length of stay, escalation, Emergency department attendance, reattendance, admission, readmission and mortality. Results: The primary aim of the remote home monitoring models was the early identification of deterioration for patients self-managing COVID-19 symptoms at home. Most models were led by secondary care. Broad criteria for the eligible patient population were used and confirmation of COVID-19 was not required (in most cases). Monitoring was carried via online platforms, paper-based systems with telephone calls or (less frequently) through wearable sensors. We could not reach conclusions regarding patient safety and the identification of early deterioration due to lack of standardised reporting across articles and missing data. None of the articles reported any form of economic analysis, beyond how the resources were used. Conclusions: The review pointed to variability in the implementation of the models, in relation to healthcare sector, monitoring approach and selected outcome measures. Lack of standardisation on reporting prevented conclusions on the impact of remote home monitoring on patient safety or early escalation during COVID-19. Future research should focus on staff and patient experiences of care and potential inequalities in access to these models. Attention needs to be paid to the processes used to implement these models, the evaluation of their impact on patient outcomes through the use of comparators, the use of risk-stratification tools, and cost-effectiveness of the models and their sustainability.

We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n=7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n=97 LFA+ individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titers during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titers, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 days. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.",Anja Garritsen; Anja Scholzen; Daan WA van den Nieuwenhof; Anke PF Smits; Esther Suzan Datema; Luc S van Galen; Milou LCE Kouwijzer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20187641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20187641,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
272,Serological Analysis Reveals an Imbalanced IgG Subclass Composition Associated with COVID-19 Disease Severity,"COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity, and the levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, including virus neutralizing titers. Through a serological analysis of serum samples from 536 convalescent healthcare workers, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels were indeed elevated in individuals that experienced severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody was dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. However, RBD- and S1-specific IgG1, rather than IgG3 were best correlated with virus-neutralizing titers. We propose that Spike-specific IgG3 subclass utilization contributes to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, and convalescent plasma therapy.",Jennifer L. Yates; Dylan J. Ehrbar; Danielle T. Hunt; Roxie Girardin; Alan P.

273,Predictors of Death in Severe COVID-19 Patients at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia: A Case-Control Study,"Background: As the number of new cases and death due to COVID-19 is increasing, understanding the characteristics of severe COVID-19 patients and identifying characteristics that lead to death is a key to make an informed decision. In Ethiopia, as of September 27, 2020, a total of 72,700 cases and 1165 deaths were reported. Objective: The study aimed to assess the determinants of death in Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. Methods: A case-control study of 147 Severe COVID-19 patients (49 deaths and 98 discharged alive cases) was conducted from August to September 2020. A comparison of underlying characteristics between cases (death) and controls (alive) was assessed using a chi-square test and an independent t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the predictor variables and outcome of Severe COVID-19 (Alive Vs Death) where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. Results: Having diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348, 7.867, p-value=0.00), fever (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027) and Shortness of breath (AOR= 4.034, 95% CI= 1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in Severe COVID-19 patients.

Various strategies are taken to curb the spread of the virus and to move out from the enforced lockdown stage. Serological tests are the neediest diagnostic and surveillance tool to complement the gold standard molecular diagnostic method to track down the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. Automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) based analyzers become highly demanding platforms both to clinicians and policy makers for the detection anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this study, serum from 594 patients positive for COVID-19 and 100 samples from pre-COVID cases were tested by three automated platforms: Abbott architect i2000SR, Roche cobas e411 and Yhlo iFlash 1800 and their diagnostic accuracy were compared.

275,Psychiatric morbidity and protracted symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients,"We investigated the psychiatric symptomatology and the protracted symptoms in recently recovered COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study assessed 284 patients recruited from a tertiary hospital. Patients completed a web-based survey on socio-demographic data, past medical/psychiatric history, and additional information relevant to the outbreak conditions. The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Both the psychiatric morbidity and the protracted symptoms were independent of the initial infection severity.

276,Detecting and isolating false negatives ofSARS-CoV-2 primers and probe sets among the Japanese Population: A laboratory testing methodology and study,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has spread across various continents in diverse methods and speed while opening up discussion for technological and scientific questions pertaining methodology of testing accuracy among diverse viral strains. On the issue of testing sensitivity and accuracy, RT-PCR is commonly viewed as a standard testing protocol globally as the predominant accurate testing method as opposed to other rapid testing methods. However, each country's infectious disease authority has established its own primers/probe sets guidelines and protocols, thereby, the global testing community lacks a ""Standardized Universal Primer(s)"" (SUP) that is foolproof for the COVID-19 patients among various populations today. As a result, RT-PCR testing accuracy and results may vary depending on which primer was used, most likely resulting in false negative and/or false positive calls associated with RT-PCR testing. In this study, a comparative study between primers from different countries' disease control centers was conducted. 11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for SARS-CoV-2 positive using recommended RT-PCR primers/probe sets from Japan National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results: Of the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent results when tested for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2. In addition, CDC recommended primer/probe sets showed relatively higher sensitivity and accuracy among the primer/probe sets used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive clones. Conclusion: Due to the inconsistency in the positive/negative results for JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer/probe sets, SARS-CoV-2 samples run via RT-PCR will result in false negative/positive subjected to differences in virus mutation in a specific sequence region targeted by a primer. This outcome shows that the use of JPN-N2 primer combined with CDC-N2 primer produces the most effective result to reduce false negatives in Japan region. Furthermore, adding CDC-N1 will result in reducing false negatives, but also false positives. Further investigation remains open for confirmation whether similar irregular pattern occur with primers targeting other regions such as E or ORF1ab in order to isolate false negatives and/or positives in future PCR testing for COVID-19.

277,Reliability and limits of transport-ventilators to safely ventilate severe patients in special surge situations.,"Background: Several Intensive Care Units (ICU) have been overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19 patients thus necessitating to extend ventilation capacity outside the ICU where air and oxygen pressure are not always available. Transport ventilators requiring only O2 source may be used to deliver volume-controlled ventilation. Objective: To evaluate the performances of four transport ventilators compared to an ICU ventilator simulating severe respiratory conditions. Materials and methods: Two pneumatic transport ventilators, (Oxylog 3000, Draeger; Osiris 3, Air Liquide Medical Systems) and two turbine transport ventilators (Elisee 350, ResMed; Monnal T60, Air Liquide Medical Systems) were compared to an ICU ventilator (Engstrom Carestation - GE Healthcare) using a Michigan training test lung. We tested each ventilator with different set volumes Vtset (350, 450, 550 ml) and different compliances (20 or 50 ml/cmH2O) and a resistance of 15 cmH20/L/sec based on values recently described in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Volume error was measured, as well as the trigger time delay during assist-control ventilation simulating spontaneous breathing activity with a P0.1 of 4 cmH20. Results: Grouping all conditions, the volume error was 2.9 +/- 2.2 % for Engstrom Carestation; 3.6 +/- 3.9 % for Osiris 3; 2.5 +/- 2.1 % for Oxylog 3000; 5.4 +/- 2.7 % for Monnal T60 and 8.8 +/- 4.8 % for Elisee 350. Grouping all conditions, trigger delay was 42 +/- 4 ms, 65 +/- 5 ms, 151 +/- 14 ms, 51 +/- 6 and 64 +/- 5 ms for Engstrom Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350, respectively. Conclusions: In special surge situations such as COVID-19 pandemic, most transport ventilators may be used to safely deliver volume-controlled ventilation in locations where only oxygen pressure supply is available with acceptable volume accuracy.

278,Pulmonary Embolism in Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"Background: There is an increasing evidence that COVID-19 could be complicated by coagulopathy which may lead to death; especially in severe cases. Hence, this study aimed to build concrete evidence regarding the incidence and mortality of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic search for trusted databases/search engines including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library and web of science. After screening, the relevant data were extracted and the incidences and mortality rates from the different included studies were pooled for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty studies were finally included in our study consisting of 1896 patients. The results of the meta-analysis for the all included studies showed that the incidence of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 17.6% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 12.7 to 22.5%. There was significant heterogeneity. Additionally, the results of meta-analysis including 8 studies showed that the mortality in patients with both PE and COVID-19 was 43.1% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 19 to 67.1%. There was significant heterogeneity. Conclusion: PE was highly frequent in patients with COVID-19. The mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and PE was remarkable representing almost half of the patients.

279,Isolation of infected people and their contacts is likely to be effective against many short-term epidemics,"Background: Isolation of infected people and their contacts may be an effective way to control outbreaks of infectious disease, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Models can provide insights into the efficacy of contact tracing, coupled with isolating or quarantining at risk people. Methods: We developed an agent-based model and simulated 15, 000 short term illnesses, with varying characteristics. For each illness we ran ten simulations on the following scenarios: (1) No tracing or isolation (None), (2) isolation of agents who have tested positive (Isolation), (3) scenario 2 coupled with minimal contact tracing and quarantine of contacts (Minimum), (4) scenario 3 with more effective contact tracing (Moderate), and (5) perfect isolation of agents who test positive and perfect tracing and quarantine of all their contacts (Maximum). Results: The median total infections of the Isolation, Minimum, Moderate and Maximum scenarios were 80%, 40%, 17% and 4% of the no intervention scenario respectively. Conclusions: Isolation of infected patients and quarantine of their contacts, even if moderately well implemented, is likely to substantially reduce the number of infections in an outbreak. Randomized controlled trials to confirm these results in the real world and to analyse the cost effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation during coronavirus and influenza outbreaks are warranted.",Nathan Geffen; Marcus O Low,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207845,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207845,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
280,High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people living in precarious situations in Ile de France,"Background A nationwide lockdown was implemented in France on 17 March 2020 to control the COVID-19 pandemic. People living in precarious conditions were relocated by the authorities to emergency shelters, hotels and large venues. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) then intervened to provide medical care in several of these locations in Paris and in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of its suburbs, between March and June 2020. A seroprevalence survey was conducted to assess the level of exposure to COVID-19 among the population living in the sites. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the impact of the pandemic on populations living in insecure conditions in Europe. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the food distribution sites, emergency shelters and workers residences supported by MSF in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, to determine the extent of COVID-19 exposure as determined by SARS-CoV2 antibody seropositivity. The detection of SARS-COV2 antibodies in serum was performed at the Institut Pasteur of Paris using two LuLISA (Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) assays and a Pseudo Neutralization Test. A questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, adherence to sanitary recommendations and symptom manifestations was also completed. We describe here the seroprevalence site by site and identify the risk factors for seropositivity using a multivariable logistic regression model with site random effects. We also investigated associations between seropositivity and symptoms eventually reported. Findings Overall, 426/818 individuals tested positive in the 14 sites investigated. Seroprevalence varied significantly with the type of site (chi2 p<0.001). It was highest at 88.7% (95%CI 81.8-93.2) among individuals living in workers residences, followed by 50.5% (95%CI 46.3-54.7) in emergency shelters and 27.8 % (95%CI 20.8-35.7) among individuals recruited from the food distribution sites. Seroprevalence also varied significantly between sites of the same type. Among other risk factors, the odds for seropositivity were higher among individuals living in crowded sites (medium: adj. OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.001; high: adj. OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.7-6.9, p<0.001) compared with individuals from low crowding sites and among those who reported transit accommodation in a gymnasium before the lockdown (adj. OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.2-8.1, p=0.023). More than two-thirds of the seropositive individuals (68.3%; 95%CI 64.2-72.2) did not report any symptoms during the recall period. Interpretation The results demonstrate rather high exposure to SARS-COV-2 with important variations between study sites. Living in crowded conditions was identified as the most important explanatory factor for differences in levels of exposure. This study describes the key factors which determine the risk of exposure and illustrates the importance of identifying populations at high risk of exposure in order to orient and adapt prevention and control strategies to their specific needs.",Thomas ROEDERER; Bastien MOLLO; Charline VINCENT; Birgit NIKOLAY; Augusto LLOSA; Robin NESBITT; Jessica VANHOMWEGEN; Thierry ROSE; Francois ANNA; Corinne TORRE; Emilie FOURREY; Sophie GOYARD; Yves JANIN; Pierre CHARNEAU; Oxana VRATSKIKH; Anneliese COURY; Stefan VANEL; Pierre MENDIHARAT; Klaudia PORTEN; William HENNEQUIN; Clair MILLS; Francisco LUQUERO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207795,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207795,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
281,AncestryDNA COVID-19 Host Genetic Study Identifies Three Novel Loci,"Human infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, leads to a remarkably diverse spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Recent reports suggest that both clinical and genetic risk factors may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To investigate genetic risk factors, we collected over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses between April and May 2020 with accompanying genetic data from the AncestryDNA database. We conducted sex-stratified and meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for COVID-19 susceptibility (positive nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) and severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). The severity GWAS replicated associations with severe COVID-19 near ABO and SLC6A20 (P<0.05). Furthermore, we identified three novel loci with P<5x10-8. The strongest association was near IVNS1ABP, a gene involved in influenza virus replication, and was associated only in males. The other two novel loci harbor genes with established roles in viral replication or immunity: SRRM1 and the immunoglobulin lambda locus. We thus present new evidence that host genetic variation likely contributes to COVID-19 outcomes and demonstrate the value of large-scale, self-reported data as a mechanism to rapidly address a health crisis.",Genevieve H.L.

282,Modelling testing and response strategies for COVID-19 outbreaks in remote Australian Aboriginal communities,"Background Remote Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have potential to be severely impacted by COVID-19, with multiple factors predisposing to increased transmission and disease severity. Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health responses. Methods An individual-based simulation model represented communities ranging from 100 to 3,500 people, comprised of large interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding, quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent introduction of a case. Results Multiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified. Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak infection prevalence from 60-70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission. Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than 10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80-90%, however, or epidemic control will be lost. Conclusions A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities. Prompt case detection with quarantining of extended-household contacts and a 14-day lockdown for all other residents, combined with exit testing for all, is the most effective strategy for rapid containment. Compliance is crucial, underscoring the need for community supported, culturally sensitive responses.",Ben B Hui; Damien Brown; Rebecca H Chisholm; Nicholas Geard; Jodie McVernon; David G Regan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208819,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208819,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
283,Report on COVID-19 Verification Case Study in Nine Countries Using the SIQR model,"This report uses the SIQR model proposed by Takashi Odagaki to examine the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in nine major countries during February-May 2020, and to clarify the peculiar trend of infection in Japan. The SIQR model, which is an improvement on the conventional SIR model, is unique in that it allows us to theoretically clarify the epidemic phenomenon by separating the number of daily confirmed new cases by testing and the number of infecteds at large who remain untested, and also allows us to theoretically consider measures to control the epidemic. The infection control measures of each country were analyzed by dividing them into three groups according to the size of the decay (or growth) rate of infected at large ({lambda}). The active group includes China and South Korea, the passive group includes the United States and Sweden, and the average group includes Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Japan. China and South Korea are the countries with the best testing and quarantine systems, and South Korea in particular having managed to contain the infection without lockdown through early quarantine by thorough testing. On the other hand, the United States and Sweden do not have a well-developed inspection and quarantine system and have shown little restraint in social distancing. In the case of Japan, the following special factors may have contributed to the extreme lack of PCR testing : (1) The ""4-day fever rule"" established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was strictly enforced. (2) Even after the decision to postpone the Olympics, the government continued to monopolize PCR testing for the sake of unified analysis of infection data, and the policy of expanding PCR testing by private companies was not implemented.",suda reiji,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208298,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208298,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
284,Cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes: a living systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE To continually evaluate the rapidly evolving evidence base on the role of cardiovascular drugs in COVID-19 clinical outcomes (susceptibility to infection, hospitalization, hospitalization length, disease severity, and all-cause mortality). DESIGN Living systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Eligible publications identified from >500 databases indexed through 31st July 2020 and additional studies from reference lists, with planned continual surveillance for at least two years. STUDY SELECTION Observational and interventional studies that report on the association between cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION Single-reviewer extraction and quality evaluation (using ROBINS-I), with half the records independently extracted and evaluated by a second reviewer. RESULTS Of 23,427 titles screened, 175 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The most reported drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACEI/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30). Among patients with COVID-19, unadjusted estimates showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with being hospitalized (OR 2.25, 1.70 to 2.98) and having severe disease (OR 1.50, 1.27 to 1.77) but not with the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.45, -1.33 to 0.43 days) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.25, CI 0.98 to 1.58). However, after adjustment, ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled adjusted OR 1.01, 0.93 to 1.10), being hospitalized (OR 1.16, 0.80 to 1.68), having severe disease (1.04, 0.76 to 1.42), or all-cause mortality (0.86, 0.64 to 1.15). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with being hospitalized (OR 0.84, 0.58 to 1.22), disease severity (OR 0.88, 0.68 to 1.14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.77, 0.54 to 1.12) while it decreased the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.71, -1.11 to -0.30 days). After adjusting for relevant covariates, other cardiovascular drug classes were mostly not found to be associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high level of heterogeneity in terms of effect sizes and a serious risk of bias, mainly due to confounding in the included studies. CONCLUSION Our comprehensive review shows that ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with COVID-19 outcomes such as susceptibility to infection, severity, and hospitalization in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, this association is not evident. Patients on cardiovascular drugs should continue taking their medications as currently recommended. Higher quality evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine any adverse or beneficial effects of cardiovascular drugs.

285,Role of high-dose exposure in transmission hot zones as a driver of SARS-CoV2 dynamics,"Epidemiological data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of various non-pharmaceutical interventions indicate that the virus is not transmitted uniformly in the population. Transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons, or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transmission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so called transmission hot zones, characterized by high dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. Interestingly, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high-dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. This gives rise to the prediction that targeted interventions that specifically reduce virus transmission in the hot zones (but not in the community at large) have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. The model can further reconcile seemingly contradicting epidemiological observations. While in some locations like California, strict stay-home orders failed to significantly reduce infection prevalence, in other locations, such as New York and several European countries, stay-home orders lead to a pronounced fall in infection levels, which remained suppressed for some months after re-opening of society. Differences in hot zone transmission levels during and after social distancing interventions can account for these diverging infection patterns. These modeling results warrant further epidemiological investigations into the role of high dose hot zone transmission for the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 spread.",Dominik Wodarz; Natalia L.

286,EFFECT OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA ON MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA,"Abstract Background Convalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing antibodies, has been proposed for COVID-19, and preliminary evidence shows that it might have beneficial effect. Our objective was to compare epidemiological characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. Methods This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. Results We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62{+/-}17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor.

287,"COVID-19, Type-2 Diabetes, and Associated Health Outcomes in China: Results from a Nationwide Survey of 10,545 Adults","Objective: This study examined the associations between type-2 diabetes (T2DM) and self-reported/familial COVID-19 infection and investigated health-related outcomes among those with diabetes during China's nationwide quarantine. Research Design and Methods: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat) across China. It was completed by 10,545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables, adjusting for covariates. Results: Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among patients with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with T2DM tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting T2DM and 8.0% without T2DM). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with T2DM experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without T2DM (22.7 % and 25.8%, respectively). Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Conclusions: T2DM was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.",Zumin Shi; Alice Yan; Paul Zimmet; Xiaoming Sun; Nayla Cristina do Vale Moreira; Lawrence J Cheskin; Liming Wang; Weidong Qu; Hong Yan; Akhtar Hussain; Youfa Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207282,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20207282,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,True
288,A high-throughput microfluidic nano-immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or ultra-low volume dried blood samples,"Novel technologies are needed to facilitate large-scale detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human blood samples. Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 L whole blood easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.",Zoe Swank; Grégoire Michielin; Hon Ming Yip; Patrick Cohen; Diego O.

289,Major role of IgM in the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2,"Characterization of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of Covid-19, is essential to help control the infection. In this regard, we and others recently reported that the neutralization activity of plasma from COVID-19 patients decreases rapidly during the first weeks after recovery. However, the specific role of each immunoglobulin isotype in the overall neutralizing capacity is still not well understood. In this study, we selected plasma from a cohort of Covid-19 convalescent patients and selectively depleted immunoglobulin A, M or G before testing the remaining neutralizing capacity of the depleted plasma. We found that depletion of immunoglobulin M was associated with the most substantial loss of virus neutralization, followed by immunoglobulin G. This observation may help design efficient antibody-based COVID-19 therapies and may also explain the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of autoimmune patients receiving therapies that impair the production of IgM.",Romain Gasser; Marc Cloutier; Jeremie Prevost; Corby Fink; Eric Ducas; Shilei Ding; Nathalie Dussault; Patricia Landry; Tony Tremblay; Audrey Laforce-Lavoie; Antoine Lewin; Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres; Annemarie Laumaea; Halima Medjahed; Catherine Larochelle; Jonathan Richard; Gregory A Dekaban; Jimmy D Dikeakos; Renee Bazin; Andres Finzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333278,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.333278,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
290,Variant analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Middle East,"BackgroundCoronavirus (COVID-19) was introduced into society in late 2019 and has now reached over 26 million cases and 850,000 deaths. The Middle East has a death toll of [~]50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over 350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

MethodsThe approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).

FindingsWe identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East.

InterpretationThe phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants affecting in the region than any other study.

291,Batch-Corrected Distance Mitigates Temporal and Spatial Variability for Clustering and Visualization of Single-Cell Gene Expression Data,"Clustering and visualization are essential parts of single-cell gene expression data analysis. The Euclidean distance used in most distance-based methods is not optimal. Batch effect, i.e., the variability among samples gathered from different times, tissues, and patients, introduces large between-group distance and obscures the true identities of cells. To solve this problem, we introduce Batch-Corrected Distance (BCD), a metric using temporal/spatial locality of the batch effect to control for such factors. We validate BCD on a simulated data as well as applied it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset. We also found the utility of our approach in understanding the progression of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). BCD achieves more accurate clusters and better visualizations than state-of-the-art batch correction methods on longitudinal datasets. BCD can be directly integrated with most clustering and visualization methods to enable more scientific findings.",Shaoheng Liang; Jinzhuang Dou; Ramiz Iqbal; Ken Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.332080,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.332080,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False

293,Neutralizing antibodies from early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection offer cross-protection against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant.,"The emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a point mutation in the spike (S) protein, D614G, has taken precedence over the original Wuhan isolate by May 2020. With an increased infection and transmission rate, it is imperative to determine whether antibodies induced against the D614 isolate may cross-neutralize against the G614 variant. In this report, profiling of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity reveals similar neutralization profiles against both S protein variants, albeit waning neutralizing antibody capacity at the later phase of infection. These findings provide further insights towards the validity of current immune-based interventions.

IMPORTANCERandom mutations in the viral genome is a naturally occurring event that may lead to enhanced viral fitness and immunological resistance, while heavily impacting the validity of licensed therapeutics. A single point mutation from aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) at position 614 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, termed D614G, has garnered global attention due to the observed increase in transmissibility and infection rate. Given that a majority of the developing antibody-mediated therapies and serological assays are based on the S antigen of the original Wuhan reference sequence, it is crucial to determine if humoral immunity acquired from the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate is able to induce cross-detection and cross-protection against the novel prevailing D614G variant.",Cheryl Yi-Pin Lee; Siti Naqiah Amrun; Rhonda Sin-Ling Chee; Yun Shan Goh; Tze Minn Mak; Sophie Octavia; Nicholas Yeo; Zi Wei Chang; Matthew Zirui Tay; Anthony Torres; Guillaume Carissimo; Chek Meng Poh; Siew-Wai Fong; Bei Wang; Sandy Lee; Barnaby Young; Seow Yen Tan; Yee Sin Leo; David Chien Boon Lye; Raymond TP Lin; Sebastian Maurer-Stroh; Bernett T.

295,Forecasting COVID-19 cases at the Amazon region: a comparison of classical and machine learning models,"BACKGROUNDSince the first reports of COVID-19, decision-makers have been using traditional epidemiological models to predict the days to come. However, the enhancement of computational power, the demand for adaptable predictive frameworks, the short past of the disease, and uncertainties related to input data and prediction rules, also make other classical and machine learning techniques viable options.

OBJECTIVEThis study investigates the efficiency of six models in forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases with 17 days ahead. We compare the models autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN), random trees regressor (RTR), seasonal linear regression with change-points (Prophet), and simple logistic regression (SLR).

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe implement the models to data provided by the health surveillance secretary of Amapaa, a Brazilian state fully carved in the Amazon rainforest, which has been experiencing high infection rates. We evaluate the models according to their capacity to forecast in different historical scenarios of the COVID-19 progression, such as exponential increases, sudden decreases, and stability periods of daily cases. To do so, we use a rolling forward splitting approach for out-of-sample validation. We employ the metrics RMSE, R-squared, and sMAPE in evaluating the model in different cross-validation sections.

FINDINGSAll models outperform SLG, especially Holt-Winters, that performs satisfactorily in all scenarios. SVR and ARIMA have better performances in isolated scenarios. To implement the comparisons, we have created a web application, which is available online.

CONCLUSIONThis work represents an effort to assist the decision-makers of Amapa in future decisions to come, especially under scenarios of sudden variations in the number of confirmed cases of Amapa, which would be caused, for instance, by new contamination waves or vaccination. It is also an attempt to highlight alternative models that could be used in future epidemics.",Dalton  Garcia Borges de Souza; Francisco  Tarcísio Alves Júnior; Nei  Yoshihiro Soma,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332908,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332908,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
296,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces mixed M1/M2 phenotype in circulating monocytes and alterations in both dendritic cell and monocyte subsets,"Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection range from mild to critically severe. The aim of the study was to highlight the immunological events associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an emphasis on cells of innate immunity. Thirty COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate symptoms and 27 patients with severe/critically severe symptoms were recruited from the Clinical Center of Kragujevac during April 2020. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to reveal phenotypic and functional alterations of peripheral blood cells and to correlate them with the severity of the disease. In severe cases, the number of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and HLA-DR-expressing cells was drastically decreased. In the monocyte population proportion between certain subsets was disturbed and cells coexpressing markers of M1 and M2 monocytes were found in intermediate and non-classical subsets. In mild cases decline in lymphocyte number was less pronounced and innate immunity was preserved as indicated by an increased number of myeloid and activated dendritic cells, NK cells that expressed activation marker at the same level as in control and by low expression of M2 marker in monocyte population. In patients with severe disease, both innate and adoptive immunity are devastated, while in patients with mild symptoms decline in lymphocyte number is lesser, and the innate immunity is preserved.",Sanja Matic; Suzana Popovic; Predrag Djurdjevic; Danijela Todorovic; Natasa Djordjevic; Zeljko Mijailovic; Predrag Sazdanovic; Dragan Milovanovic; Dejana Ruzic Zecevic; Marina Petrovic; Maja Sazdanovic; Nenad Zornic; Vladimir Vukicevic; Ivana Petrovic; Snezana Matic; Marina Karic Vukicevic; Dejan Baskic,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332858,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.332858,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,,False
297,Age- and Sex-Specific Modelling of the COVID-19 Epidemic,"BackgroundRecent research points towards age- and sex-specific transmission of COVID-19 infections and their outcomes. The effect of sex, however, has been overlooked in past modelling approaches of COVID-19 infections.

AimThe aim of our study is to develop an age- and sex-specific model of COVID-19 transmission and to explore how contact changes effect COVID-19 infection and death rates.

MethodWe consider a compartment model to establish forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the compartments are subdivided into different age groups and genders. Estimated contact patterns, based on other studies, are incorporated to account for age- and sex-specific social behaviour. The model is fitted to real data and used for assessing hypothetical scenarios with regard to lockdown measures.

ResultsUnder current mitigation measures as of mid-August, active COVID-19 cases will double by the end of October 2020. Infection rates will be highest among the young and working ages, but will also rise among the old. Sex ratios reveal higher infection risks among women than men at working ages; the opposite holds true at old age. Death rates in all age groups are twice as high among men as women. Small changes in contact rates at working and young ages may have a considerable effect on infections and mortality at old age, with elderly men being always at higher risk of infection and mortality.

DiscussionOur results underline the high importance of the non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures in the current phase of the pandemic to prevent that an increase in contact rates leads to higher mortality among the elderly. Gender differences in contact rates, in addition to biological mechanisms related to the immune system, may contribute to sex-specific infection rates and their mortality outcome.

298,Personal protective equipment for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers involved in emergency trauma surgery during the pandemic: a systematic review protocol,"ObjectiveThe objective of this broad evidence synthesis is to identify and summarize the available literature regarding the efficacy of different personal protective equipment (PPE) for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery in low-resource environments (LREs).

IntroductionMany healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced and may lack optimal organization and governance, especially concerning surgical health systems. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for the patients.

Inclusion criteriaThis review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in emergency trauma surgery.

MethodsWe will conduct several searches in the L{middle dot}OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Critical appraisal of the eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardized data extraction tool in Covidence.

299,System Dynamics Model of Possible Covid-19 Trajectories Under Various Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Options in Low Resource Setting.,"We present a population-based System Dynamics Model (SDM) of possible Covid-19 trajectories under various intervention options in the uniqueness of Kenya. We developed a stock and flow based SDM. We parametrized the SDM using published data and where data was not available, expert opinion was sought. Following validation test, the model was simulated to determined possible outcomes of non-pharmaceutical interventions in management of Covid-19. We simulate the possible impact of; social distancing, quarantining, curfew and cross-county travel restriction, lockdown of selected cities in Kenya and quarantining. We varied interventions in terms of start dates, duration of implementation and effectiveness of the interventions. We estimated the outcomes in terms of number of possible infections, recoveries and deaths. With the current state of interventions, we estimated a peak of Covid-19 in September 2020 with an estimated 13.5 Million Covid-19 cases and 33.8 thousand deaths in Kenya. The largest possible reduction in infections and mortality was achievable through increase in the effectiveness of the interventions. The suggested interventions would delay the epidemic peak of Covid-19 to between late Nov 2020 and early December 2020 with an estimated13M cases a 500 thousand reduction in Covid-19 cases and 32.4 deaths (a reduction in 1400 deaths).

Methodsthis prospective, observational, single-centre study included outpatients reviewed 12 weeks after an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation included data about the acute episode and epidemiological and clinical variables. The patients were classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the persistence or otherwise of symptoms. All the patients underwent a full blood test and serology for SARS-CoV-2, as well as imaging tests and spirometry if needed.

ResultsThe mean age of the 108 patients was 55.5 (SD: 15.4) years and 27.8% were health-care workers; 75.9% presented some type of symptoms, with dyspnoea being the most common.

301,"Clinical, laboratory, and temporal predictors of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may protect from reinfection and disease, providing the rationale for administration of plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a treatment for COVID-19. The clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood.

MethodsAdults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb.

ResultsAmongst 250 consecutive persons studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers [&ge;]1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.

ConclusionsNab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing.

Given the authorized nationwide use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin in COVID-19 patients, we aimed to evaluate their effectiveness alone or combined to reduce 30-day mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients without life-threatening illness.

MethodsDesign. Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records to emulate a target trial. Settings. Nationwide data of mid- and high-level complexity hospitals from the Peruvian Social Health Insurance (EsSalud) between April 1 and July 19, 2020. Participants. Patients 18 years old and above with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, and no diagnosis of severe disease at admission. Interventions. Five treatment groups, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone (HCQ), ivermectin alone (IVM), azithromycin alone (AZIT), HCQ + AZIT group, and IVM + AZIT within 48 hours of admission at doses recommended by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Comparison. Standard of care treatment without receiving any of the mentioned drugs within 48 of admission. Outcomes: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate, and secondary outcomes were survival without death or ICU transfer, and survival without death or oxygen prescription. Analysis. Analysis were adjusted for confounding factors using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Propensity scores were estimated using machine learning boosting models. Weighted hazard ratios (wHR) were calculated using Cox regression

ResultsAmong 5683 patients, 200 received HCT, 203 IVM, 1600 AZIT, 692 HCQ + AZIT, 358 IVM + AZIT, and 2630 received standard of care. The AZIT + HCQ group was associated with 84% higher all-cause mortality hazard rate compared to standard care (wHR=1.84, 95%CI 1.12-3.02). Consistently, AZIT + HCQ treatment was associated with deaths or ICU transfer ICU (wHR=1.49, 95%CI 1.01-2.19), and deaths or oxygen prescription (wHR=1.70, 95%CI 1.07-2.69). HCQ treatment was only associated with death or oxygen prescription (wHR=1.77, 95% CI 1.01-3.11), and IVM was only associated with death or ICU transfer (wHR=1.58, 95%CI 1.11-2.25).

MethodsWe performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19.

ResultsA total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c [&le;] 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein > 88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia < 1,000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission.

304,Comparison of efficacy of Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone in improving P/F ratio among COVID-19 patients,"IntroductionThe severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), created a pandemic in late 2019. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2 patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants.

ResultsThe initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg/L after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg/L, which decreased to 43.82 mg/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P/F ratio (p<0.05), and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p<0.05).

ConclusionSteroids ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients.

MethodWe analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and August 2020 and online surveys on mental health among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

ResultsCompared to the last three years (2017-2019), the number of suicide deaths was lower during the initial phase of the pandemic but subsequently exceeded the past trend. By August 2020, the total number of suicides was 7.72% higher than the average number of suicides in the same month of the previous three years. The largest increase was found in suicides by young women (less than 40 years of age), with a 63.1% increase in August 2020 compared to the same month in the past three years. The number of suicides among students and housekeepers in summer months was notably larger in 2020. The survey data indicated that the status of mental health among young women was worse than that of women in other age groups. In addition, young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss in recent months compared to any other groups, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding some of these young female workers.

306,BayesSMILES: Bayesian Segmentation Modeling for Longitudinal Epidemiological Studies,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic. To characterize the disease transmissibility, we propose a Bayesian change point detection model using daily actively infectious cases. Our model is built upon a Bayesian Poisson segmented regression model that can 1) capture the epidemiological dynamics under the changing conditions caused by external or internal factors; 2) provide uncertainty estimates of both the number and locations of change points; 3) adjust any explanatory time-varying covariates. Our model can be used to evaluate public health interventions, identify latent events associated with spreading rates, and yield better short-term forecasts.",Shuang Jiang; Quan Zhou; Xiaowei Zhan; Qiwei Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208132,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208132,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True
307,Plasma ACE2 activity is persistently elevated following SARS-CoV-2 infection: implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis and consequences,"COVID-19 causes persistent endothelial inflammation, lung and cardiovascular complications. SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We reported downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma ACE2 activity. In this prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes and increased plasma ACE2 activity.

MethodsWe measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay in a cohort of Australians aged [&ge;]18 years (n=66) who had recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR testing) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples were available in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients.

ResultsPlasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days] was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in plasma ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive had higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (p<0.0001). We next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection. Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects, with no significant differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p>0.05).

DiscussionThis is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after COVID-19 infection, and the first with longitudinal data indicating plasma ACE2 activity remains elevated out to a median of 114 days post-infection. Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistent elevated plasma ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19.",Sheila K Patel; Jennifer A Juno; P Mark Hogarth; Wen Shi Lee; Stephen J Kent; Louise M Burrell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207514,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207514,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True
308,Mask mandates can limit COVID spread: Quantitative assessment of month-over-month effectiveness of governmental policies in reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases in 37 US States and the District of Columbia,"IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 is the beta-coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Facemask use has been qualitatively associated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but no study has quantitatively assessed the impact of government mask mandates (MM) on new COVID-19 cases across multiple US States.

Data and MethodsWe utilized a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm to test the a priori hypothesis that MM were associated with reductions in new COVID-19 cases. Publicly available data were used to analyze new COVID-19 cases from 37 States and the District of Columbia (i.e., ""38 States""). We conducted confirmatory All-States and State-Wise analyses, validity analyses [e.g., leave-one-out (LOO) and bootstrap resampling], and covariate analyses.

ResultsNo statistically significant difference in the daily number of new COVID-19 infections was discernable in the All-States analysis. In State-Wise LOO validity analysis, 11 States exhibited reductions in new COVID-19 and the reductions in four of these States (AK, MA, MN, VA) were significant in bootstrap resampling. Only the Social Capital Index predicted MM success (training p<0.028 and LOO p<0.013).

ConclusionResults obtained when studying the impact of MM on COVID-19 cases varies as a function of the heterogeneity of the sample being considered, providing clear evidence of Simpsons Paradox and thus of confounded findings. As such, studies of MM effectiveness should be conducted on disaggregated data. Since transmissions occur at the individual rather than at the collective level, additional work is needed to identify optimal social, psychological, environmental, and educational factors which will reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate MM effectiveness across diverse settings.",Michael J Maloney; Nathaniel James Rhodes; Paul R Yarnold,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208033,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208033,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,,True

This contribution aims to use tools of time series analysis for understanding processes of contagious through regions. I use VAR and Granger causality for testing neighbor spreading via sequential rate of contagion. Results show that in the case of Argentina, contagion began in the capital city of Buenos Aires and then spread to its hinterland via specific districts. Once interior districts were infected a positive feedback dynamics emerge creating regions of high reproducibility of the virus where interventions may be focus in the very near future. This specific use of time series analysis may provide a tool for tracing infectiousness along regions that may help to anticipate infection and then for intervening for reducing the problems derived by the disease.",Juan M.C.

310,Misinterpretation of viral load in COVID-19.,"Knowledge of viral load is essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. Moreover, patients identification with high viral load could also be useful to understand risk factors such as age, comorbidities, severity of symptoms and hypoxia to decide the need for hospitalization. Several studies are evaluating the importance of analyzing viral load in different types of samples, clinical outcomes and viral transmission pathways. However, in a great number of emerging studies cycle threshold (Ct) values by itself is often used as a viral load indicator, which may be a mistake. In this study, we compared tracheal aspirate with nasopharyngeal samples obtained from critically ill COVID-19 patients and demonstrate how the raw Ct could lead to misinterpretation of results. Further, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs positive samples and propose a method to reduce evaluation error that could occur from using raw Ct. Based on these findings, we show the impact that normalization of Ct values has on interpretation of viral load data from different biological samples from patients with COVID-19, transmission and lastly in relations with clinical outcomes.

ImportanceIn a pandemic, prevention of disease transmission is key. Reliable data for profiles of viral load are needed and important to guide antiviral treatment, infection control and vaccination. The differential expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA among patient groups is a current topic of interest and viral load has been associated with a diversity of outcomes. However, in a great number of emerging studies cycle threshold (Ct) values by itself is often used as a viral load indicator, which may be a mistake.

A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional sample of 30 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis, humoral and inflammatory responses. 132 distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitope responses across six different HLAs were detected, corresponding to 52 unique reactivities. T cell responses were directed against several structural and non-structural virus proteins. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response. Overall, T cells exhibited distinct differentiation into stem-cell and transitional memory states, subsets, which may be key to developing durable protection.",Hassen Kared; Andrew D Redd; Evan M Bloch; Tania S.

312,Preferential recognition and antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binding to 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is in immediate need of an effective antidote. Although the Spike glycoprotein (SgP) of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to heparins, the structural features of this interaction, the role of a plausible heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptor, and the antagonism of this pathway through small molecules remain unaddressed. Using an in vitro cellular assay, we demonstrate HSPGs modified by the 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform-3, but not isoform-5, preferentially increased SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in comparison to control, unmodified, wild-type HSPGs. Computational studies support preferential recognition of the receptor-binding domain of SgP by 3-O-sulfated HS sequences. Competition with either fondaparinux, a 3-O-sulfated HS-binding oligopeptide, or a synthetic, non-sugar small molecule, blocked SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Finally, the synthetic, sulfated molecule inhibited fusion of GFP-tagged pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with human 293T cells with sub-micromolar potency. Overall, overexpression of 3-O-sulfated HSPGs contribute to fusion of SARS-CoV-2, which could be effectively antagonized by a synthetic, small molecule.",Vaibhav Tiwari; Ritesh Tandon; Nehru Viji Sankaranarayanan; Jacob C Beer; Ellen K Kohlmeir; Michelle Swanson-Mungerson; Umesh R.

313,Genome-scale identification of SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus host factor networks,"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than one million people worldwide. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which are viruses that cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses. This human Coronaviridae host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus spillover events.

315,Developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on probe mix and amplitude based multiplexing,"Multiplexing has been highlighted to save on costs, increase sample throughput, and maximize on the number of targets that can be sensitively detected within a small sample. With the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, different articles have been published highlighting the superiority of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) over the gold reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. In this study, we developed simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and fourplex (4 targets) assays based on a two color ddPCR system for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results showed that the fourplex assay had the similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical isolates demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug couldnt. Conclusively, our research shows that developing multiplex ddPCR assays is possible by combing probe mix and amplitude based multiplexing, which will help in developing multiplexed ddPCR assays for different SARS-CoV-2 applications.",Raphael Nyaruaba; Changchang Li; Caroline Mwaliko; Matilu Mwau; Nelson Odiwuor; Elishiba Muturi; Caroline Muema; Jin Xiong; Junhua Li; Junping Yu; Hongping Wei,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207506,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207506,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True

One of the primary benefits of face masks and other coverings is as source control devices to reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols during coughing, breathing, and speaking. Face shields have been proposed as an alternative to face masks, but information about face shields as source control devices is limited. We used a cough aerosol simulator with a headform to propel small aerosol particles (0 to 7 {micro}m) into different face coverings. An N95 respirator blocked 99% of the cough aerosol, a procedure mask blocked 59%, a 3-ply cloth face mask blocked 51%, and a polyester neck gaiter blocked 47% as a single layer and 60% when folded into a double layer.

317,Contact tracing and isolation reduces Covid-19 incidence in a structured agent-based model,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe World Health Organization has identified contact tracing and isolation (CTI) as a key strategy to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Structured agent-based models (ABMs) provide a means to investigate the efficacy of such strategies in heterogeneous populations and to explore the impact of factors such as changes in test turnaround times (TaT).

MethodsWe developed a structured ABM to simulate key SARS-CoV-2 transmission and Covid-19 disease progression dynamics in populations of 10, 000 agents. We ran 10, 000 simulations of each of three scenarios: (1) No CTI with a TaT of two days, (2) CTI with a TaT of two days, and (3) CTI with a TaT of eight days. We conducted a secondary analysis in which TaT values were varied from two to 11. The primary outcome for all analyses was mean total infections.

ResultsCTI reduced the mean number of infections from 5, 577 to 4, 157 (a relative reduction of 25.5%) when TaT was held steady at two days. CTI with a TaT of eight days resulted in a mean of 5, 163 infections (a relative reduction of 7.4% compared to no CTI and a TaT of two days). In the secondary analysis, every additional day added to the TaT increased the total number of infections - with the greatest increase in infections between four and five days, and the smallest increase between ten and 11 days.

ConclusionsIn a structured ABM that simulates key dynamics of Covid-19 transmission and disease progression, CTI results in a substantial reduction in the mean number of total infections. The benefit is greater with shorter TaT times, but remained substantial even with TaTs of eight days. The results suggest that CTI may play a critical role in reducing the size of outbreaks and that TaTs should be kept as short as possible in order to maximise this benefit.",Marcus O Low; Nathan Geffen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207761,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207761,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True

Phylogenetic analysis identified 8 global lineages and at least 76 independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Kenyan coast. The dominant B.1 lineage (European origin) accounted for 82.1% of the cases. Lineages A, B and B.4 were detected from screened individuals at the Kenya-Tanzania border or returning travellers but did not lead to established transmission. Though multiple lineages were introduced in coastal Kenya within three months following the initial confirmed case, none showed extensive local expansion other than cases characterised by lineage B.1, which accounted for 45 of the 76 introductions. We conclude that the international points of entry were important conduits of SARS-CoV-2 importations.

319,Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.,"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic is likely to lead to a significant increase in mental health disorders amongst healthcare workers (HCW).

AimsWe evaluated the prevalence of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a HCW population in the United Kingdom (UK), to identify subgroups most at risk.

MethodsAn electronic survey was conducted between the 05/06/2020 and 31/07/2020 of all hospital HCW in the West Midlands, UK using clinically validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations.

ResultsThere were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female: 79.5%, median age: 42 [IQR: 32-51] years). The prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were 34.3%, 31.2% and 24.5% respectively. In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.9-2.7]; p<0.001), depression (2.5 [2.1-3.0]; p<0.001) and PTSD (2.1 [1.7-2.5]; p<0.001). The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), wellbeing support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with former symptoms (p[&le;]0.001).

ConclusionsWe report a high prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD in hospital HCW following the initial Covid-19 pandemic peak in the UK.

Although various reports on possible psychiatric side effects of these drugs exist, the nature and extent of these effects remain poorly understood. Moreover, the relevance of these drugs in the treatment of early stages of COVID-19 necessitates a careful estimation of their side effects. Here, we provide a systematic review of the psychiatric side effects associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to identify relevant literature published between 1962 and 2020. Search terms included chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, psychiatry, psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, delirium, and psychotic disorders. Only case reports and clinical trials were included. All studies included records of psychiatric side effects induced by either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or both. Both retrospective and prospective, randomized as well as non-randomized population studies were included. Overall, the psychiatric side effects are dose- and sex-independent. The most common psychiatric side effects reported are increased speech output/ excessive talking, increased psychomotor activity, irritable mood, auditory hallucinations, delusion of grandiosity, and suicide attempts, likely due to brain intoxicationbe of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The symptoms can develop in a few hours to 11 weeks after drug intake and are normally reversed within a week after the drug withdrawal.

321,A potential impact of physical distancing on physical and mental health. A rapid narrative umbrella review of meta-analyses on the link between social isolation and health,"BackgroundThe imperative for physical distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may deteriorate physical and mental health. We aimed at summarizing the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of social isolation and loneliness with physical and mental health.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone, and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social isolation and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarized in a narrative synthesis.

ResultsTwenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. A total of more than 3 million individuals had participated in the 692 primary studies. The results suggest that social isolation is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life, and suicidal ideation.

ConclusionsThe existing evidence clearly indicates that social isolation is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.

Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that business shutdowns are very effective in reducing mortality. We calculate that the death toll from the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy would have been twice as high in their absence. Our findings also highlight that timeliness is key - by acting one week earlier, the government could have reduced the death toll by an additional 25%. Finally, our estimates suggest that shutdowns should be targeted: closing shops, bars and restaurants saves the most lives, while shutting down manufacturing and construction activities has only mild effects.",Gabriele Ciminelli; Silvia Garcia-Mandico,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207910,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207910,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
323,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using pooling of self-collected samples: Simple protocols may foster asymptomatic surveillance,"1BackgroundSurveillance of COVID infection and isolation of infected individuals is one of the available tools to control the spread of SAR-CoV-2. Asymptomatic and pre symptomatic are responsible for substantial transmission. RNA or antigen tests are necessary to identify non-symptomatic individuals. We tested the feasibility of using samples pooling offering different collection alternatives (swab/throat wash/saliva) to volunteers of a public health institute.

MethodsWe evaluated pool samples from frozen material from previously tested samples and a prospective collection from asymptomatic volunteers. Some collections were paired for comparison. Pools and some individual samples were extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and/or Lucigen Quick Extract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch, USA) and submitted to rtPCR (Allplex, Seegene, Korea).

ResultsA total of 240 samples from 130 new collections and 37 samples with known result were evaluated. Pool CT was generally higher than individual samples. Lucigen extraction showed higher CT, including false negative results for samples with high CT at Qiagen extraction. Paired Swab and TW samples showed comparable results. No volunteer from negative pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after collection.

ConclusionsClinical samples pooling to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is feasible and an economical way to test for COVID-19, especially in surveillance strategies targeting more infectiousness, higher viremia individuals. The use of Lucigen reagents show lower sensibility that may lead to false negative results with lower viremia samples. Combining throat wash with saliva may provide and interesting self-collection alternative, but more comparative work is needed.",Giselle Ibette Silva Lopez Lopes; Rita de Cassia Compagnoli Carmona; Valeria Oliveira Silva; Cintia Mayumi Ahagon; Lincoln Spinazola do Prado; Fabiana Cristina Pereira dos Santos; Daniela Bernardes Borges da Silva; Wiliam Nery Ribeiro; Elaine Monteiro Matshuda; Auldrey Cilli; Ana Maria Sardinha Afonso; Margarete Aparecida Benaga Pinho; Maria do Carmo Sampaio Tavare Timnetsky; Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20205872,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20205872,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,True
324,"Antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in adults from the Vancouver metropolitan area, Canada","BackgroundQuantifying antibody reactivity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the population level may help understand individual differences in COVID-19 severity. Pre-existing low antibody cross-reactivity may be particularly prevalent among childcare providers, including pediatric health care workers (HCW) who may be more exposed to circulating coronaviruses.

MethodsCross-sectional study that included adults in the Vancouver area in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between May 17 and June 19, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was ascertained by measuring total SARS-CoV-2 IgG/M/A antibodies against a recombinant spike (S1) protein and adjusted for bias due to false-positive and false-negative test results. A novel, high sensitivity multiplex assay was also used to profile IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV and four circulating coronaviruses.

FindingsAmong 276 participants (71% HCW), three showed evidence of direct viral exposure, yielding an adjusted seroprevalence of 0.60% [95%CI 0% - 2.71%], with no difference between HCW and non-HCW, or between paediatric and adult HCW. Among the 273 unexposed individuals, 7.3% [95%CI 4.5% - 11.1%], 48.7 [95%CI 42.7% - 54.8%] and 82.4% [95%CI 77.4% - 86.7%] showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, N or Spike proteins, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 reactivity did not significantly correlate with age, sex, did not significantly differ between HCW and non-HCW (prevalence 1.0% vs 1.0%; P=1.00) and between pediatric and adult HCW (0.7% vs 1.6%; P=0.54), and modestly correlated with reactivity to circulating coronaviruses (Spearman rho range: 0.130 to 0.224 for 7 significant (FDR 5%), out of 16 correlations, from 36 correlations tested).

InterpretationA substantial proportion of individuals showed low, but detectable antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens in this population despite a low evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

325,The potential impact of intervention strategies on COVID-19 transmission in Malawi: A mathematical modelling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings such as Malawi due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we estimate the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity.

MethodsThe infection fatality ratios (IFR) in Malawi were estimated by adjusting reported IFR for China accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions. The impact of a novel therapeutic agent and increases in hospital capacity and oxygen availability were explored, given different assumptions on mortality rates.

FindingsThe estimated age-specific IFR in Malawi are higher than those reported for China, however the younger average age of the population results in a slightly lower population-weighted IFR (0.48%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.30% - 0.72% compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% - 1.3% in China). The current interventions implemented, (i.e. social distancing, workplace closures and public transport restrictions) could potentially avert 3,100 deaths (95% UI 1,500 - 4,500) over the course of the epidemic. Enhanced shielding of people aged [&ge;] 60 years could avert a further 30,500 deaths (95% UI 17,500 - 45,600) and halve ICU admissions at the peak of the outbreak. Coverage of face coverings of 60% under the assumption of 50% efficacy could be sufficient to control the epidemic. A novel therapeutic agent, which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity could reduce projected mortality to 2.55 deaths per 1,000 population (95% UI 1.58 - 3.84).

ConclusionThe risks due to COVID-19 vary across settings and are influenced by age, underlying health and health system capacity.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIAs COVID-19 spreads throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, countries are under increasing pressure to protect the most vulnerable by suppressing spread through, for example, stringent social distancing measures or shielding of those at highest risk away from the general population.
C_LIO_LIThere are a number of studies estimating infection fatality ratio due to COVID-19 but none use data from African settings. The estimated IFR varies across settings ranging between 0.28-0.99%, with higher values estimated for Europe (0.77%, 95% CI 0.55 - 0.99%) compared with Asia (0.46%, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.55).
C_LIO_LIThe IFR for African settings are still unknown, although several studies have highlighted the potential for increased mortality due to comorbidities such as HIV, TB and malaria.
C_LIO_LIThere are a small number of studies looking at the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Africa, particularly South Africa, but none to date have combined this with country-specific estimates of IFR adjusted for comorbidity prevalence and with consideration to the prevailing health system constraints and the impact of these constraints on mortality rates.

What are the new findings?O_LIAfter accounting for the health system constraints and differing prevalences of underlying comorbidities, the estimated infection fatality ratio (IFR) for Malawi (0.48%, 95% uncertainty interval 0.30% - 0.72%) is within the ranges reported for the Americas, Asia and Europe (overall IFR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 - 0.82, range 0.28 - 0.89).
C_LIO_LIIntroducing enhanced shielding of people aged [&ge;] 60 years could avert up to 30,500 deaths (95% UI 17,500 - 45,600) and significantly reduce demand on ICU admissions.

326,"Economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","ImportanceThe US population faces stressors associated with suicide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation may inform policies and programs to prevent suicide.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignWe compared suicidal ideation in 2017-2018 to suicidal ideation in 2020. We estimated the association between stressors and suicidal ideation in bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsParticipants were from two, nationally representative surveys of US adults: The 2017-2017 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (conducted March 31 to April 13), analyzed April 28 to September 30, 2020.

ExposuresEconomic precarity as measured through job loss or difficulty paying rent and social isolation based on reporting ""feeling alone.""

Main outcome measureSuicidal ideation based on reporting ""Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way"" over the past two weeks.

ResultsSuicidal ideation increased more than fourfold, from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), while losing a job was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Feeling alone was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.4).

327,Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and social distancing: A cross-sectional study,"Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, a controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic within the period of June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = 0.017) with individuals perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = 0.032) and education level (P < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted  knowledge about social distancing. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < 0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the  perception of COVID-19 origin and  the perception and knowledge about social distancing.",Lenisse M.

328,MAJORA: Continuous integration supporting decentralised sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance,"Genomic epidemiology has become an increasingly common tool for epidemic response. Recent technological advances have made it possible to sequence genomes rapidly enough to inform outbreak response, and cheaply enough to justify dense sampling of even large epidemics. With increased availability of sequencing it is possible for agile networks of sequencing facilities to collaborate on the sequencing and analysis of epidemic genomic data.

In response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium was formed with the aim of rapidly sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes as part of a national-scale genomic surveillance strategy. The network consists of universities, academic institutes, regional sequencing centres and the four UK Public Health Agencies.

We describe the development and deployment of Majora, an encompassing digital infrastructure to address the challenge of collecting and integrating both genomic sequencing data and sample-associated metadata produced across the COG-UK network. The system was designed and implemented pragmatically to stand up capacity rapidly in a pandemic caused by a novel virus.

329,Production of ORF8 protein from SARS-CoV-2 using an inducible virus-mediated expression-system in suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spread worldwide in 2019, is an urgent problem to be overcome. The ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to be associated with the symptoms of COVID-19, according to reports of clinical studies. However, little is known about the function of ORF8. As one of the ways to advance the functional analysis of ORF8, mass production of ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure is necessary. In this study, we attempted to produce ORF8 protein by chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells. An ORF8-producing line was generated by the Agrobacterium method. As a result, the production of ORF8 of 8.8 {+/-} 1.4 mg/L of culture medium was confirmed. SDS-PAGE and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis confirmed that the ORF8 produced by this system is a dimeric form with a three-dimensional structure, unlike that produced in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was suggested that the ORF8 produced by this system was N-glycosylated. Through this study, we succeeded in producing ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure in a chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY2 cells. It is expected that the functional analysis of ORF8 will be advanced using the ORF8 produced by this system and that it will greatly contribute to the development of vaccines and antibodies against ORF8.",Tomohiro Imamura; Noriyoshi Isozumi; Yasuki Higashimura; Shinya Ohki; Masashi Mori,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.325910,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.325910,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
330,Extremely potent human monoclonal antibodies from convalescent Covid-19 patients,"Human monoclonal antibodies are safe, preventive and therapeutic tools, that can be rapidly developed to help restore the massive health and economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. By single cell sorting 4277 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific memory B cells from 14 Covid-19 survivors, 453 neutralizing antibodies were identified and 220 of them were expressed as IgG. Up to 65,9% of monoclonals neutralized the wild type virus at a concentration of >500 ng/mL, 23,6% neutralized the virus in the range of 100 - 500 ng/mL and 9,1% had a neutralization potency in the range of 10 - 100 ng/mL. Only 1,4% neutralized the authentic virus with a potency of 1-10 ng/mL. We found that the most potent neutralizing antibodies are extremely rare and recognize the RBD, followed in potency by antibodies that recognize the S1 domain, the S-protein trimeric structure and the S2 subunit. The three most potent monoclonal antibodies identified were able to neutralize the wild type and D614G mutant viruses with less than 10 ng/mL and are good candidates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic tools against SARS-CoV-2.

331,"SARS-CoV-2 has observably higher propensity to accept uracil as nucleotide substitution: Prevalence of amino acid substitutions and their predicted functional implications in circulating SARS-CoV-2 in India up to July, 2020","SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as pandemic all over the world since late 2019. In this study, we investigated the diversity of the virus in the context of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. Full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of the circulating viruses from all over India were collected from GISAID, an open data repository, until 25thJuly, 2020. We have focused on the non-synonymous changes across the genome that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Analysis of the genomic signatures of the non-synonymous mutations demonstrated a strong association between the time of sample collection and the accumulation of genetic diversity. Most of these isolates from India belonged to the A2a clade (63.4%) which has overcome the selective pressure and is spreading rapidly across several continents. Interestingly a new clade I/A3i has emerged as the second-highest prevalent type among the Indian isolates, comprising 25.5% of the Indian sequences. Emergence of new mutations in the S protein was observed. Major SARS-CoV-2 clades in India have defining mutations in the RdRp. Maximum accumulation of mutations was observed in ORF1a.

Other than the clade-defining mutations, few representative non-synonymous mutations were checked against the available crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the DynaMut server to assess their thermodynamic stability. We have observed that SARS-CoV-2 genomes contain more uracil than any other nucleotide. Furthermore, substitution of nucleotides to uracil was highest among the non-synonymous mutations observed. The A+U content in SARS-CoV-2 genome is much higher compared to other RNA viruses, suggesting that the virus RdRp has a propensity towards uracil incorporation in the genome. This implies that thymidine analogues may have a better chance to competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication than other nucleotide analogues.",Subrata Roy; Himadri Nath; Abinash Mallick; Subhajit Biswas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.329771,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.329771,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
332,Making the invisible enemy visible,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, structural biologists have rushed to solve the structures of the 28 proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome in order to understand the viral life cycle and enable structure-based drug design. In addition to the 200 structures from SARS-CoV previously solved, 367 structures covering 16 of the viral proteins have been released in the span of only 6 months.

These structural models serve as basis for research worldwide to understand how the virus hijacks human cells, for structure-based drug design and to aid in the development of vaccines. However, errors often occur in even the most careful structure determination - and are even more common among these structures, which were solved under immense pressure.

333,Mass spectrometric based detection of protein nucleotidylation in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2, encode a nucleotidyl transferase in the N-terminal NiRAN domain of the non-structural protein (nsp) 12 protein within the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 1-3. Though the substrate targets of the viral nucleotidyl transferase are unknown, NiRAN active sites are highly conserved and essential for viral replication 3. We show, for the first time, the detection and sequence location of GMP-modified amino acids in nidovirus RdRP-associated proteins using heavy isotope-assisted MS and MS/MS peptide sequencing. We identified lys-143 in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein, nsp7, as a primary site of nucleotidylation in vitro that uses a phosphoramide bond to covalently attach with GMP. In SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins, we demonstrate a unique O-linked GMP attachment on nsp7 ser-1, whose formation required the presence of nsp12. It is clear that additional nucleotidylation sites remain undiscovered, which includes the possibility that nsp12 itself may form a transient GMP adduct in the NiRAN active site that has eluted detection in these initial studies due to instability of the covalent attachment. Our results demonstrate new strategies for detecting GMP-peptide linkages that can be adapted for higher throughput screening using mass spectrometric technologies. These data are expected to be important for a rapid and timely characterization of a new enzymatic activity in SARS-CoV-2 that may be an attractive drug target aimed at limiting viral replication in infected patients.",Michael R Sussman; Brian J Conti; Robert N Kirchdoerfer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330324,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330324,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False
334,NSP 11 of SARS-CoV-2 is an Intrinsically Disordered Protein,"The intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDPRs) are known to be responsible for multiple cellular processes and are associated with many chronic diseases. In viruses, the existence of disordered proteome is also proven and are related with its conformational dynamics inside the host. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a large proteome, in which, structure and functions of many proteins are not known as of yet. Previously, we have investigated the dark proteome of SARS-CoV-2. However, the disorder status of non-structural protein 11 (nsp11) was not possible because of very small in size, just 13 amino acid long, and for most of the IDP predictors, the protein size should be at least 30 amino acid long. Also, the structural dynamics and function status of nsp11 was not known. Hence, we have performed extensive experimentation on nsp11. Our results, based on the Circular dichroism spectroscopy gives characteristic disordered spectrum for IDPs. Further, we investigated the conformational behaviour of nsp11 in the presence of membrane mimetic environment, alpha helix inducer, and natural osmolyte. In the presence of negatively charged and neutral liposomes, nsp11 remains disordered. However, with SDS micelle, it adopted an -helical conformation, suggesting the helical propensity of nsp11. At the end, we again confirmed the IDP behaviour of nsp11 using molecular dynamics simulations.",Kundlik Gadhave; Prateek Kumar; Ankur Kumar; Taniya Bhardwaj; Neha Garg; Rajanish Giri,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330068,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.330068,2020-10-07,2020-10-07,,False

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.",Roy H.

Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.

Materials and methodsFemales with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression.

ResultsIn total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 {+/-} 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 {+/-} 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 {+/-} 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), headache (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), dry cough (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), myalgia (1.2 {+/-} 0.4), nauseas (1.3 {+/-} 0.5) and weakness (1.3 {+/-} 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication.

ConclusionsA sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.",Flavio A Cadegiani; Carlos Gustavo Wambier; Andy Goren,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206870,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206870,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
337,WORLDWIDE CASE FATALITY RATIO OF COVID-19 OVER TIME,"BackgroundThe case fatality ratio (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to be variable among different countries and regions but few analyses have tracked this ratio worldwide over time.

MethodsThe primary objective was to assess the time-course evolution of CFR of COVID-19 in all countries with available data and secondary objective was to evaluate associations between country-wise CFR and country-level health, human development, demographic and economic parameters. Day-wise data of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country was extracted from a public repository and countries with at least 1000 cases on cutoff date were clustered by unsupervised k-means on the basis of deaths per 100000 population (DP100K). Day-wise CFR (cumulative deaths divided by cumulative cases, multiplied by 100) for each country and cluster (country group) was plotted as time-series and country-level parameters were tested for association with CFR using weighted multiple linear regression.

ResultsOn September 24, 2020 there were 32140504 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 981792 deaths reported from 184 countries for a worldwide CFR of 3.06 % (95%CI 3.05 -3.07). Unsupervised k-means clustering in 157 countries with at least 1000 reported cases resulted in Clusters (country groups) A, B, C, D and E with centroid DP100K and CFR of 0.100 and 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 0.503 and 2.28 (95% CI 2.23-2.33), 1.816 and 1.73 (95% CI 1.71-1.75), 7.395 and 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76), and 36.303 and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively. In a log-log analysis DP100K and CFR were significantly positively correlated (R=0.3570, p<0.001) with each other. All country groups and majority of included countries showed a pattern of gradually increasing CFR from the beginning of pandemic, followed by a plateau and then a steady decline in CFR. Among 10 country-level parameters, GDP per capita ({beta}=-0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population ({beta}=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality from air pollution ({beta}=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density ({beta}=-0.570, p< 0.000) were significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio ({beta}=0.431, p=0.000) and age ({beta}=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR.

ConclusionsThe CFR of COVID-19 has gradually increased over time in majority of countries at various stages of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and a steady decline. Population level COVID-19 mortality burden and CFR are significantly positively associated with each other.",Rohan Chaubal; Sadhana Kannan; Navin Khattry; Sudeep Gupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206599,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206599,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
338,"Markers Of Coagulation And Hemostatic Activation Identify COVID-19 Patients At High Risk For Thrombotic Events, ICU Admission and Intubation","BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a coagulopathy giving rise to venous and arterial thrombotic events. The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications.

MethodsCOVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as [&ge;] 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission and those who were pregnant.

ResultsOf 276 patients (mean age 59 {+/-} 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race) who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer [&ge;] 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer [&ge;]2000 ng/mL and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint.

ConclusionsAdmission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events. Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients.",Darwish Alabyad; Srikant Rangaraju; Michael Liu; Rajeel Imran; Christine Kempton; Milad Sharifpour; Sara Auld; Manila Gaddh; Roman Sniecinski; Cheryl L Maier; Jeannette Guarner; Alexander Duncan; Fadi Nahab,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206540,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206540,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
339,A haemagglutination test for rapid detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of seroconversion in populations, detection of seroconversion after vaccination, and for seeking evidence for a level of antibody that may be protective against COVID-19 disease. Several high-performance commercial tests have been described, but these require centralised laboratory facilities that are comparatively expensive, and therefore not available universally. Red cell agglutination tests have a long history in blood typing, and general serology through linkage of reporter molecules to the red cell surface. They do not require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied as a Point of Care Test (POCT). We describe a red cell agglutination test for the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We show that the Haemagglutination Test (""HAT"") has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a PCR diagnosed infection. The HAT can be titrated, detects rising titres in the first five days of hospital admission, correlates well with a commercial test that detects antibodies to the RBD, and can be applied as a point of care test. The developing reagent is composed of a previously described nanobody to a conserved glycophorin A epitope on red cells, linked to the RBD from SARS-CoV-2. It can be lyophilised for ease of shipping. We have scaled up production of this reagent to one gram, which is sufficient for ten million tests, at a cost of [~]0.27 UK pence per test well. Aliquots of this reagent are ready to be supplied to qualified groups anywhere in the world that need to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but do not have the facilities for high throughput commercial tests.",Alain Townsend; Pramila Rijal; Julie Xiao; Tiong Kit Tan; Kuan-Ying A Huang; Lisa Schimanski; Jiangdong Ho; Nimesh Gupta; Rolle Rahikainen; Philippa C Matthews; Derrick Crook; Sarah Hoosdally; Teresa Street; Justine Rudkin; Nicole Stoesser; Fredrik Karpe; Matthew Neville; Rutger Ploeg; Marta Oliveira; David J Roberts; Abigail A Lamikanra; Hoi Pat Tsang; Abbie Bown; Richard Vipond; Alexander J Mentzer; Julian C Knight; Andrew Kwok; Gavin Screaton; Juthathip Mongkolsapaya; Wanwisa Dejnirattisai; Piyada Supasa; Paul Klenerman; Christina Dold; Kenneth Baillie; Shona C Moore; Peter JM Openshaw; Malcolm G Semple; Lance CW Turtle; Mark Ainsworth; Alice Allcock; Sally Beer; Sagida Bibi; Elizabeth Clutterbuck; Alexis Espinosa; Maria Mendoza; Dominique Georgiou; Teresa Lockett; Jose Martinez; Elena Perez; Veronica Sanchez; Giuseppe Scozzafava; Alberto Sobrinodiaz; Hannah Thraves; Etienne Joly,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205831,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205831,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
340,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Management of Heart Failure -A United Kingdom Patient Questionnaire Study,"AimThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges to healthcare globally, necessitating rapid restructuring of service provision. This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services.

Methods and ResultsThe survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF), a UK HF patient charity. ""Survey Monkey"" was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the PMFs online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (out-patient hospital and community HF clinics). 1050 responses were collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID19 (mean 7{+/-}2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared to anxiety regarding HF (6.1{+/-}2.4; p<0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged [&le;]60 years about HF (6.3{+/-}2.2 versus 5.9{+/-}2.5 in those aged >60 years; p=0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3{+/-}2.3 versus 6.7{+/-}2.6 those aged >60 years; p<0.001). 65% respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period. 37% reported disruption to medication prescription services and 34% reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. 32% expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all).

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients regarding COVID-19 and HF. Cancellation or postponement of scheduled clinic appointments, investigations, procedures, prescription and monitoring services were implicated as sources of anxiety.",Rajiv Sankaranarayanan; Nick Hartshorne-Evans; Sam Redmond-Lyon; Jill Wilson; Hani Essa; Alastair Gray; Louise Clayton; Carys Barton; Fozia Z Ahmed; Colin Cunnington; Duwarakan Satchithananda; Clare Murphy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205328,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205328,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
341,"The relationship between neighborhood poverty and COVID-19 mortality within racial/ethnic groups (Cook County, Illinois)","AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPrior research has identified higher rates of COVID-19 mortality among people of color (relative to non-Hispanic whites) and populations in high-poverty neighborhoods (relative to wealthier neighborhoods). It is unclear, however, whether non-Hispanic whites in high-poverty neighborhoods experience elevated mortality, or whether people of color living in wealthy areas are relatively protected. Exploring socioeconomic position in combination with race/ethnicity can lead to a more detailed understanding of the specific processes that result in COVID-19 inequities.

Methods and FindingsWe used census and individual-level mortality data for the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic/Latinx populations of Cook County, Illinois, USA. We excluded deaths related to nursing homes and other institutions. We calculated age and gender-adjusted mortality rates by race/ethnicity, census tract poverty quartile, and age group (0-64 and [&ge;]65 years).

Within all racial/ethnic groups, COVID-19 mortality rates were greatest in the highest-poverty quartile and lowest in the lowest-poverty quartile. The mortality rate for younger non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was 13.5 times that of younger non-Hispanic whites in the lowest-poverty quartile (95% CI: 8.5, 21.4). For young people in the highest-poverty quartile, the non-Hispanic white and Black mortality rates were similar. Among younger people in the lowest-poverty quartile, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx people had mortality rates nearly three times that of non-Hispanic whites. For the older population, the mortality rate among non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was less than that of lowest-poverty non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are partly, but not entirely, attributable to the higher average socioeconomic position of non-Hispanic whites relative to the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. Future research on health equity in COVID-19 outcomes should collect and analyze individual-level data on the potential mechanisms driving population distributions of exposure, severe illness, and death.",Justin M Feldman; Mary T Bassett,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206318,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206318,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
342,"Strategies for infection control and prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 4,554 employees of a university hospital in Munich, Germany","BackgroundHospital staff are at high risk of infection during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We analysed the exposure characteristics, efficacy of protective measures, and transmission dynamics in this hospital-wide prospective seroprevalence study.

Methods and FindingsOverall, 4554 individuals were tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Individual risk factors, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), occupational exposure, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and correlated to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres and PCR testing results. Odds ratios with corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate associations between individual factors and seropositivity. Spatio-temporal trajectories of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and staff mobility within the hospital were visualised to identify local hotspots of virus transmission.

The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody was 2.4% [95% CI 1.9-2.9]. Patient-facing staff, including those working in COVID-19 areas, had a similar probability of being seropositive as non-patient-facing staff. Prior interaction with SARS-CoV-2-infected co-workers or private contacts and unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients increased the probability of seropositivity. Loss of smell and taste had the highest positive predictive value for seropositivity. The rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 25.9%, and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres were observed in symptomatic individuals. Spatio-temporal hotspots of SARS-CoV-2-positive staff and patients only showed partial overlap.

ConclusionsPatient-facing work in a healthcare facility during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be safe if adequate PPE and hygiene measures are applied. The high numbers of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections that escaped detection by symptomatic testing underline the value of cross-sectional seroprevalence studies. Unprotected contact is a major risk factor for infection and argues for the rigorous implementation of hygiene measures.",Johanna Erber; Verena Kappler; Bernhard Haller; Hrvoje Mijocevic; Ana Galhoz; Clarissa Prazeres da Costa; Friedemann Gebhardt; Natalia Graf; Dieter Hoffmann; Markus Thaler; Elke Lorenz; Hedwig Roggendorf; Florian Kohlmayer; Andreas Henkel; Michael M Menden; Juergen Ruland; Christoph D Spinner; Ulrike Protzer; Percy Knolle; Paul Lingor,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206136,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206136,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize the current evidence on KAPs regarding COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search on PubMed/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 Jul 2020. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. PROSPERO registration code: (CRD42020186755).

ResultsFifty-two studies encompassing 49786 participants were included in this review. 45.76% of the participants were male. The mean age of the participants was 32.6 years. 44.2% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 46.2% as fair quality, and remaining (9.6%) as low quality. 30.76% examined all three components of the KAPs model.

Use of CCP units with a signal-to-cutoff ratio of [&ge;]12 using the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (OVSARS2IgG) is authorized. Little is known about the relationship between this ratio and the neutralizing capacity of plasma/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2 virus. We measured the neutralizing capacity of 981 samples from 196 CCP donors 7-119 days post initial donation (DPID). Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Importantly, while 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT90/PRNT50) of donations met the FDA minimum titer of 1:80 initially, only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met this cut-off [&ge;]85 DPID. A subset of 91 donations were evaluated using the OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy.

347,Multi-omics highlights ABO plasma protein as a causal risk factor for COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the current health crisis. Despite intensive research efforts, the genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19 remain poorly understood. We therefore used an integrative genomics (IG) approach to identify candidate genes responsible for COVID-19 and its severity. We used Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) and summary-based Mendelian randomization to combine gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Lung eQTL (n=1,038) and eQTLGen (n=31,784) studies with published COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Additionally, we used COLOC to integrate plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from the INTERVAL study (n=3,301) with COVID-19-associated loci. Finally, we determined any causal associations between plasma proteins and COVID-19 using multi-variable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). We found that the expression of 20 genes in lung and 31 genes in blood was associated with COVID-19. Of these genes, only three (LZTFL1, SLC6A20 and ABO) had been previously linked with COVID-19 in GWAS. The novel loci included genes involved in interferon pathways (IL10RB, IFNAR2 and OAS1). Plasma ABO protein, which is associated with blood type in humans, demonstrated a significant causal relationship with COVID-19 in MR analysis; increased plasma levels were associated with an increased risk of having COVID-19 and risk of severe COVID-19. In summary, our study identified genes associated with COVID-19 that may be prioritized for future investigation. Importantly, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal association between plasma ABO protein and COVID-19.",Ana I Hernandez Cordero; Xuan Li; Stephen Milne; Chen Xi Yang; Yohan Bosse; Philippe Joubert; Wim Timens; Maarten van den Berge; David Nickle; Ke Hao; Don D Sin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207118,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207118,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

The population effort to comply the lockdown has been decreasing over time given the economic and social costs that it entails. We contributes by analyzing the Argentinian case through information of mobility and contagion given answers to recurrent questions on these topics. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing the effects of lockdown measures and the regional relaxation on the numbers of rate of new infections. We also respond to issues of internal political discussion on regional contagion and the effect of marches and unexpected crowd events. We use pool, fixed and random effects panel data modeling and Granger causality tests identifying relations between mobility and contagion. Our results show that lockdown in Argentina has been effective in reducing the mobility but not in way that reduces the rate of contagion.

349,Serological testing in addition to PCR screening for the re-opening of American colleges and universities: potential for cost-savings without compromising pandemic mitigation,"ImportanceThe addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan.

ObjectivesTo determine whether a college/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresTesting costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing.

ResultsIncluding baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions.

Conclusions and RelevanceWhile regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.

Key Points (96/100)O_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan the addition of a serological testing reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for universities in the United States?

FindingsThis costing study suggested that inclusion of serological testing in addition to outsourced PCR testing as part of a university re-opening strategy could achieve cost savings of up to 20%. The amount of savings, or additional costs, is dependent on insourcing or outsourcing of testing, epidemic conditions and university size.

350,Development of a customised data management system for a COVID-19-adapted colorectal cancer pathway,"PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems around the world. To mitigate the risks of those referred with possible colorectal cancer during the pandemic we implemented a clinical pathway which required a customised data management system for robust operation. Here, we describe the principal concepts and evaluation of the performance of a spreadsheet-based data management system.

MethodsA system was developed using Microsoft Excel(R) 2007 aiming to retain the spreadsheets inherent intuitiveness of direct data entry. Data was itemised limiting entry errors. Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was used to construct a user-friendly interface to enhance efficiency of data entry and segregate the data required for operational tasks. This was done with built-in loop-back data entry. Finally data derivation and analysis was performed to facilitate pathway monitoring.

ResultsFor a pathway which required rapid implementation and development of a customised data management system, the use of a spreadsheet was advantageous due to its user-friendly direct data entry capability. Its function was enhanced by UserForm and large data handling by data segregation using VBA macros. Data validation and conditional formatting minimised data entry errors. Computation by the COUNT function facilitated live data monitoring on a dashboard. During the three months the pathway ran for, the system processed 36 nodal data points for each of the included 837 patients. Data monitoring confirmed its accuracy.

ConclusionLarge volume data management using a spreadsheet system is possible with appropriate data definition and VBA programmed data segregation. Clinicians regular input and optimisation made the system adaptable for rapid implementation.",Frances Gunn; Janice Miller; Malcolm G Dunlop; Farhat V N Din; Yasuko Maeda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206920,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206920,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
351,Rationale and prognosis of repurposed drugs with risk stratification of patients in oxygen support in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background The rising number of trials on repurposed dugs in COVID-19 has led to duplication and a need for curation of available outcomes from treatments that have been followed across the world. We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that focus on evaluating the clinical outcomes of repurposed interventions against COVID-19. Methods Random effects model was adopted to estimate overall treatment effect and heterogeneity. Meta-regression was performed to study the correlation between comorbid conditions and non-invasive or invasive ventilation requirement. Results Twenty-nine articles met our eligibility criteria. In subgroup analysis, Tocilizumab was highly significant with lower mortality rate (OR 27.50; 95%CI [5.39-140.24]) of severe COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir-ritonavir was found to be inefficacious in severe patients (OR 0.64; 95%CI [0.47-0.86] and 1.40 [0.71-2.76]). Dexamethasone had marginal effect on overall mortality rate (OR 1.19; 95%CI [1.05-1.35]). The meta-regression shows a positive correlation between prevalence of patients on Tocilizumab in non invasive support and hypertension condition (P = 0.02), whereas a negative correlation was identified with patients having lung disease (P = 0.03). Conclusion Overall, our study confirmed that tocilizumab may probably reduce the mortality rate (<10%) of severe COVID-19 patients than other interventions. Further, reduce the risk of requiring non-invasive ventilator support in patients with comorbid condition of lung disease. Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir-ritonavir has no clinical benefits in severe COVID-19.

352,The relative effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on early Covid-19 mortality: natural experiment in 130 countries,"BackgroundConcurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented around the world to control Covid-19 transmission. Their general effect on reducing virus transmission is proven, but they can also be negative to mental health and economies, and transmission behaviours can also change in absence of mandated policies. Their relative impact on Covid-19 attributed mortality rates, enabling policy selection for maximal benefit with minimal disruption, is not well established.

MethodsWe exploited variations in nine non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 130 countries (3250 observations) in two periods chosen to limit reverse causality: i) prior to first Covid-19 death (when policymakers could not possibly be reacting to deaths in their own country); and, ii) 14-days-post first Covid-19 death (when deaths were still low, on average). We examined associations with daily deaths per million in each subsequent 24-day period (the time between virus transmission and mortality) which could only be affected by the policy period. A mean score of strictness and timeliness was coded for each intervention. Days in each country were indexed in time by first reported Covid-19 death to proxy for virus transmission rate. Multivariable linear regression models of Covid-19 mortality rates on all concurrent interventions were adjusted for seasonality, potential confounders, and potential cross-country differences in their mortality definitions. Robustness was checked by removing countries with known data reporting issues and with non-linear, negative binomial, models.

ResultsAfter adjusting for multiple concurrent interventions and confounders, and accounting for both timing and strictness of interventions, earlier and stricter school (-1.23 daily deaths per million, 95% CI -2.20 -0.27) and workplace closures (-0.26, 95% CI -0.46 -0.05) were associated with lower Covid-19 mortality rates. Only controlling for strictness international travel controls, and only controlling for timing later restrictions on gatherings, were also associated with lower Covid-19 mortality. Other interventions, such as stay-at-home orders or restrictions on public transport, were not significantly associated with differences in mortality rates across countries. Findings were robust across multiple statistical approaches.

353,Comparative policy analysis of face mask mandates during COVID 19 pandemic on rate of mask use in the United States,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAs COVID 19 continues to spread throughout the United States, there has been a search for policies to both prevent individual infections, to slow the spread of the virus in general, and to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. Masks have proven to be a cost-effective measure in all regards, and as such some state governments have begun to mandate their use. However, while the efficacy of masks has been demonstrated, the efficacy of public policies which mandate the use of masks has not been demonstrated. This paper compares the rates of mask use in counties as defined by state policy. It is found that state mandates are strongly correlated with higher rates of mask use, and that mandating use by all individuals in public spaces is more effective than a less comprehensive mandate for mask use by all public facing employees.",Michael J Maloney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206326,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206326,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
354,Development and comparison of a novel multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay with other nucleic acid amplification methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection,"ObjectivesTo develop a novel multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay for COVID-19 and compare its speed and sensitivity to existing loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) methods.

MethodsTwo MCDA assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab was designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and RT-PCR using 7 DNA standards and transcribed RNA.

ResultsFor the N gene, MCDA was consistently faster than LAMP and RT-PCR by 10 and 20 minutes, respectively with a fastest time to detection of 5.2 minutes. RT-PCR had the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of 100 copies/reaction compared with MCDA (1000 copies/reaction) and LAMP (5000/reaction). For ORF1ab, MCDA and LAMP had similar speed with fastest time to detection at 9.7 and 8.4 minutes, respectively. LAMP was more sensitive for ORF1ab detection with 500 copies/reaction compared to MCDA (5000 copies/reaction).

ConclusionsDifferent nucleic acid amplification methods provide different advantages. MCDA is the fastest nucleic acid amplification method for COVID-19 while RT-PCR is still the most sensitive.

356,"Renin Angiotensin System Inhibition and Susceptibility and Outcomes from COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 69,200 COVID-19 Patients","BackgroundEarly observational studies suggested that the use of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, specifically angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, may increase the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and adversely affect the prognosis or survival of infected patients. To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies.

Methods and FindingsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31). There was no significant difference in the severe Covid-19 case rate between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36), (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.12), or in mortality due to COVID-19 between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.44), (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23), (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14).

ConclusionsIn the most comprehensive analysis of all available data to date, treatment with RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of infection, severity of disease, or mortality due to COVID-19. The best available evidence suggests that these treatments should not be discontinued on the basis of concern about risk associated with COVID-19.",Yi Zhang; Shikai Yu; Yawei Xu; Bryan Williams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206375,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206375,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
357,A multiplex microsphere IgG assay for SARS-CoV-2 using ACE2-mediated inhibition as a surrogate for neutralization,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges inherent to the serological detection of a novel pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens--spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals ([&le;]5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at [&le;]5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% vs. 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7; in days from symptom onset), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled ICU patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP.

The challenge of how to communicate these then becomes apparent. Based on empirical work (total n=5,520, UK) supported by in-person interviews with public and physicians, we make recommendations on the presentation of such information. These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing (for balance) a format which conveys a higher perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10,000); using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative  persona who might face that highest level of risk; and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other  personas illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These  personas should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described.

359,Assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of household-pooled universal testing to control COVID-19 epidemics,"Current outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics currently relies on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the current testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.",Pieter Jules Karel Libin; Lander Willem; Timothy Verstraeten; Andrea Torneri; Joris Vanderlocht; Niel Hens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205765,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205765,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
360,Impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals on COVID-19 mortality in different countries,"Several recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus. However, pathophysiological implications of these findings remain unknown. Here, the potential impact of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals on markedly different COVID-19 mortality levels in different countries has been investigated. The inverse correlation is documented between the prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus and COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries. In countries with similar levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, differences in COVID-19 mortality appear linked with the extend and consistency of implementations of social measures designed to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing). Collectively, these observations support the model that the level of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is one of the important determinants of the innate herd immunity against COVID-19. Together with the consistent social measures directed to limit the virus spread, high levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells appear significant determinants diminishing the COVID-19 mortality. Observations reported in this contribution should have significant impact on definitions of the herd immunity threshold required to effectively stop the pandemic in different countries across the globe.",Gennadi Glinsky,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206151,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206151,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
361,Diagnostic performance of the combined nasal and throat swab in patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19,"BackgroundAccurate diagnosis in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential to guide treatment and limit spread of the virus. The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain.

MethodsIn a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results.

ResultsWe enrolled 1,369 consecutive patients (68 [53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3,822 tests (median 2 [1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1,369), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing.

ConclusionsIn patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.

362,Monitoring for COVID-19 by universal testing in a homeless shelter in Germany: a prospective feasibility cohort study,"BackgroundLiving conditions in homeless shelters may facilitate the transmission of COVID-19. Social determinants and pre-existing health conditions place homeless people at increased risk of severe disease. Described outbreaks in homeless shelters resulted in high proportions of infected residents and staff members. In addition to other infection prevention strategies, regular shelter-wide (universal) testing for COVID-19 may be valuable, depending on the level of community transmission and when resources permit.

MethodsThis was a prospective feasibility cohort study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter with 106 beds in Berlin, Germany. Co-researchers were recruited from the shelter staff. A PCR analysis of saliva or self-collected nasal/oral swab was performed weekly over a period of 3 weeks in July 2020. Acceptability and implementation barriers were analyzed by process evaluation using mixed methods including evaluation sheets, focus group discussion and a structured questionnaire.

ResultsNinety-three out of 124 (75%) residents were approached to participate in the study. Fifty-one out of the 93 residents (54.8%) gave written informed consent. High retention rates (88.9% - 93.6%) of a weekly respiratory specimen were reached, but repeated collection attempts, as well as assistance were required. A self-collected nasal/oral swab was considered easier and more hygienic to collect than a saliva specimen. No resident was tested positive. Language barriers were the main reason for non-participation. Flexibility of sample collection schedules, the use of video and audio materials, and concise written information were the main recommendations of the co-researchers for future implementation.

ConclusionVoluntary universal testing for COVID-19 is feasible in homeless shelters. Universal testing of high-risk facilities will require flexible approaches, considering the level of the community transmission, the available resources, and the local recommendations. Lack of human resources and laboratory capacity may be a major barrier for implementation of universal testing, requiring adapted approaches compared to standard individual testing. Assisted self-collection of specimens and barrier free communication may facilitate implementation in homeless shelters.

363,SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence and Seroprevalence among Healthcare Workers in Belgian Hospitals: Baseline Results of a Prospective Cohort Study,"BackgroundGiven the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the occurrence of a second wave, assessing the burden of disease among health care workers (HCWs) is crucial. We aim to document the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs in Belgian hospitals, and to study potential risk factors for the infection in order to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in healthcare institutions.

MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline results (April 22 - April 26) of an ongoing cohort study. All staff who were present in the hospital during the sampling period and whose profession involved contact with patients were eligible. Fourteen hospitals across Belgium and 50 HCW per hospital were randomly selected. RT-qPCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs, and a semi-quantitative IgG ELISA was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera. Individual characteristics likely to be associated with seropositivity were collected using an online questionnaire.

Findings698 participants completed the questionnaire; 80.8% were women, median age was 39.5, and 58.5% were nurses. Samples were collected on all 699 participants. The weighted anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 7.7% (95%CI, 4.7%-12.2%), while 1.1% (95%CI, 0.4%-3.0%) of PCR results were positive.

364,The excess insulin requirement in severe COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis is related to the severity of respiratory failure and pre-existing diabetes.,"ObjectiveSevere COVID-19 has been anecdotally associated with high insulin requirements. It has been proposed that this may be driven by a direct diabetogenic effect of the virus that is unique to SARS-CoV-2, but evidence to support this is limited. To explore this, we compared insulin requirements in patients with severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis.

Research DesignRetrospective cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit between March and June 2020. A historical control cohort of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis patients was identified from routinely collected audit data.

ResultsInsulin requirements were similar in patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis after adjustment for pre-existing diabetes and severity of respiratory failure.

ConclusionsIn this single center study, we could not find evidence of a unique diabetogenic effect of COVID-19. We suggest that high insulin requirements in this disease relate to its propensity to cause severe respiratory failure in patients with pre-existing metabolic disease.",Sam Lockhart; Harry Griffiths; Bogdan Petrisor; Ammara Usman; Julia Calvo-Latorre; Laura Heales; Vishakha Bansiya; Razeen Mahroof; Andrew Conway Morris,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206284,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206284,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
365,Chest pain presentations to hospital during the COVID-19 lockdown: lessons for public health media campaigns,"ObjectiveEmergency Department (ED) attendances with chest pain reduced during the COVID-19 lockdown. To understand factors influencing patients decisions to attend hospital, we performed a local service evaluation project in NHS Lothian.

MethodsWe collated data on online searches and local clinical services on the number of ED presentations and chest pain clinic (CPC) referrals with suspected acute coronary syndrome between January and May 2020 and compared findings with the same period in 2019. We also carried out 28 semi-structured telephone interviews with patients who presented with chest pain during lockdown and in patients with known coronary heart disease under the outpatient care of a cardiologist in April and May 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and salient themes and issues documented as verbatim extracts.

ResultsOnline searches for the term ""chest pain"" doubled after 01/03/2020, peaking in week commencing 22/03/2020 and returning to 2019 levels during April 2020. In contrast, chest pain presentations to ED and CPC decreased, with the greatest reduction in the final week of March 2020 (128 v 287 (average weekly ED attendance 2019), and 6 v 23 (average weekly CPC referral 2019)). This aligned with key government messages to  Protect the NHS and the  NHS is open campaign. Patient interviews revealed three main themes; 1) pandemic help-seeking behaviour2) COVID-19 exposure concerns; 3) favourable Hospital experience if admitted.

ConclusionsDynamic monitoring of public health and media messaging should evaluate public response to healthcare campaigns to ensure the net impact on health, pandemic and non-pandemic related, is optimised.

What is already known about the subject?Reports from around the world revealed a decrease in the numbers of patients attending hospital for serious health complaints such as chest pain during the lockdown restrictions imposed by governments to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

What does this study add?This service evaluation project has provided insight into how patients experiencing chest pain made the decision to attend hospital for assessment during this period. It has revealed how the pandemic shaped help-seeking practices, how patients interpreted their personal vulnerability to the virus, and describes patient experience of attending hospital for assessment during this time.

How might this impact on clinical practice?Careful monitoring of the public response to health care messaging campaigns should be a key part of a pandemic strategy and careful adjustment of messaging, in a dynamically responsive way, should be considered in future.",Amy V Ferry; Collette Keanie; Martin A Denvir; Nicholas L Mills; Fiona E Strachan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20203687,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20203687,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
366,Vitamin D status and seroconversion for COVID-19 in UK healthcare workers who isolated for COVID-19 like symptoms during the 2020 pandemic.,"BackgroundIt is clear that in UK healthcare workers, COVID-19 infections and deaths were more likely to be in staff who were of BAME origin. This has led to much speculation about the role of vitamin D in healthcare worker COVID-19 infections. We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in NHS staff who have isolated with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and relate this to vitamin D status.

MethodsWe recruited NHS healthcare workers between 12th to 22nd May 2020 as part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). We measured anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies using a combined IgG, IgA and IgM ELISA (The Binding Site). Vitamin D status was determined by measurement of serum 25(OH)D3 using the AB SCIEX Triple Quad 4500 mass spectrometry system.

FindingsOf the 392 NHS healthcare workers, 214 (55%) had seroconverted for COVID-19. A total of 61 (15.6%) members of staff were vitamin D deficient (<30 nmol/l) with significantly more staff from BAME backgrounds or in a junior doctor role being deficient. Vitamin D levels were lower in those who were younger, had a higher BMI (>30 kg/m2), and were male. Multivariate analysis revealed that BAME and COVID-19 seroconversion were independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency. Staff who were vitamin D deficient were more likely to self-report symptoms of body aches and pains but importantly not the respiratory symptoms of cough and breathlessness. Vitamin D levels were lower in those COVID-19 positive staff who reported fever, but this did not reach statistical significance. Within the whole cohort there was an increase in seroconversion in staff with vitamin D deficiency compared to those without vitamin D deficiency (n=44/61, 72% vs n=170/331, 51%; p=0{middle dot}003); this was particularly marked in the proportion of BAME males who were vitamin D deficient compared to non-vitamin D deficient BAME males (n=17/18, 94% vs n=12/23, 52%; p=0{middle dot}005). Multivariate analysis revealed that vitamin D deficiency was an independent risk factor for seroconversion (OR 2{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}41-4{middle dot}80; p=0{middle dot}002).

InterpretationIn those healthcare workers who have isolated due to symptoms of COVID-19, those of BAME ethnicity are at the highest risk of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for COVID-19 seroconversion for NHS healthcare workers especially in BAME male staff.

FundingThis study was funded internally by the University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)/Wellcome Trust Birmingham Clinical Research Facility. AAF and DRT are funded by the Medical Research Council (MR/S002782/1). The Binding Site (Edgbaston, UK) have provided reagents and plates for the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA free of charge.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has raised several questions, one of which is whether individuals with vitamin D deficiency were at a greater risk of being infected or having a severe outcome if infected. Among UK healthcare workers, and indeed the general population, individuals of BAME ethnicity are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. It is well established that individuals of BAME ethnicity have a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, but it is unknown if vitamin D deficiency among UK NHS workers was connected to the risk of COVID-19 infection. Our search of the literature revealed no previous studies have established the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency within a UK NHS trust. Unsurprisingly, there is also no evidence to suggest if vitamin D deficiency was connected to the risk of infection among UK healthcare workers.

Added value of this studyIn this study of healthcare workers who had isolated for COVID-19 symptoms towards the end of UK surge within a large UK NHS trust, 15.6% were vitamin D deficient. Our data also reveal that healthcare workers of BAME ethnicity and those who had seroconverted for COVID-19 were more likely to be vitamin D deficient. Multivariate analysis also show that vitamin D deficiency was the only predictor of COVID-19 seroconversion. Vitamin D deficient healthcare workers that are BAME and male had a 94% seroconversion for COVID-19 compared to non-deficient BAME males suggesting they are more at risk of COVID-19 if vitamin D deficient.

Implications of all the available evidenceThere is an increased risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers with vitamin D deficiency. Our data adds to the emerging evidence from studies in the UK and across the globe that individuals with severe COVID-19 are more vitamin D deficient than those with mild disease. Finally, ours and the available evidence demonstrate vitamin D supplementation in individuals at risk of vitamin D deficiency or shown to be deficient may help alleviate the impact of COVID-19.",Aduragbemi A Faniyi; Sebastian T Lugg; Sian E Faustini; Craig Webster; Joanne E Duffy; Martin Hewison; Adrian Shields; Peter Nightingale; Alex G Richter; David R Thickett,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206706,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206706,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
367,Performance of Existing and Novel Surveillance Case Definitions for COVID-19 in the Community,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents with a broad range of symptoms. Existing COVID-19 case definitions were developed from early reports of severely ill, primarily hospitalized, patients. Symptom-based case definitions that guide public health surveillance and individual patient management in the community must be optimized for COVID-19 pandemic control.

MethodsWe collected daily symptom diaries and performed RT-PCR on respiratory specimens over a 14-day period in 185 community members exposed to a household contact with COVID-19 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas. We interpreted the discriminatory performance (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, F1 score, Youdens index, and prevalence estimation) of individual symptoms and common case definitions according to two principal surveillance applications (i.e., individual screening and case counting). We also constructed novel case definitions using an exhaustive search with over 73 million symptom combinations and calculated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by children versus adults.

FindingsCommon COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (8696%) but low positive predictive value (PPV) (3649%; F1 score 5263) in this community cohort. The top performing novel symptom combinations included taste or smell dysfunction. They also improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F1 score 7880) and reduced the number of false positive symptom screens. Performance indicators were generally lower for children (<18 years of age).

InterpretationExisting COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in community members with COVID-19. However, they led to many false positive symptom screens and poorly estimated community prevalence. Absent unlimited, timely testing capacity, more accurate case definitions may help focus public health resources. Novel symptom combinations incorporating taste or smell dysfunction as a primary component better balanced sensitivity and specificity. Case definitions tailored specifically for children versus adults should be further explored.

FundingThis research was wholly supported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence has accelerated globally over the last several months. As the full spectrum of clinical presentations has come into clearer focus, symptom-based clinical screening and case surveillance has also evolved. Preliminary understanding of the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 was driven primarily by descriptions of hospitalized patients, as early testing algorithms prioritized more severely ill persons with classic lower respiratory symptoms and fever. Since then, more data from ambulatory settings have emerged. We searched PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 21 August 2020 for studies that assessed the diagnostic performance of case surveillance definitions for COVID-19. We found no studies examining the discriminatory performance of case surveillance definitions among contacts with mild to moderate symptoms with documented exposure to persons with COVID-19. Nonetheless, we found nine highly relevant studies: seven original reports and two review articles. Five original studies evaluated individual, self-reported symptoms (two among healthcare workers in the United States, one among healthcare workers in the Netherlands, and one online survey for the general public in Somalia) and concluded that using dysfunction of taste or smell for routine COVID-19 screening likely had utility. The fifth study had a similar conclusion based on self-reported symptoms and laboratory results collected via smartphone from the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. Another original study modeled the substantial effect that multiple revisions to the COVID-19 case definition had on the reported disease burden in the Chinese population. Lastly, an original study illustrated the shift in discriminatory performance of established influenza surveillance case definitions for influenza between adults and children. Age-specific differences in case definition performance may also apply to COVID-19. Two articles reviewed predictive algorithms to define outpatient COVID-19 illness and risk of hospitalization. The reviewed studies were limited in that they were either restricted to individual signs or symptoms, or they incorporated blood tests or imaging that required in-person access to medical care.

Added value of this studyThe discriminatory performance of case surveillance definitions for COVID-19 is important for implementing effective epidemic mitigation strategies. Our study illustrates the performance of case definitions in community members with household exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based solely on symptom profiles. Prior work overrepresented healthcare workers or otherwise studied non-representative populations, and they did not examine across the age spectrum. Our study also provides a novel framework for refining definitions. Using 15 symptoms associated with COVID-19 for all contacts regardless of disease status, we systematically evaluated the discriminatory performance of individual symptoms and previously defined case surveillance definitions across ages and according to two core surveillance applications: 1) screening non-hospitalized individuals to prioritize public health interventions, and 2) estimating the number of non-hospitalized persons with COVID-19 (i.e., community-based syndromic surveillance). We also constructed novel symptom combinations that effectively performed both functions and improved upon widely used case surveillance definitions that may help to target interventions in the absence of unlimited laboratory diagnostic capacity. Our analyses highlight the importance of ongoing re-evaluation of symptom-based surveillance definitions to suit the intended purpose and population under surveillance. Based on our results, which were derived from household members of all ages, case surveillance definition performance may improve if developed separately for adults and children.

Implications of all the available evidenceCase definitions for COVID-19 should be tailored to maximize the discriminatory performance dependent upon its intended use. Existing COVID-19 case definitions screened in most community members with COVID-19, but also yielded a high number of false positive results. When unlimited, timely diagnostic testing is not available symptom combinations with improved accuracy (i.e., more balanced sensitivity and specificity) may help focus resources, such as recommending self-isolation among community contacts.",Hannah E.

369,Dilution-based Evaluation of Airborne Infection Risk - Thorough Expansion of Wells-Riley Model,"Evaluation of airborne infection risk with spatial and temporal resolutions is indispensable for the design of proper interventions fighting infectious respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19), because the distribution of aerosol contagions is both spatially and temporally non-uniform. However, the well-recognized Wells-Riley model and modified Wells-Riley model (i.e., the rebreathed-fraction model) are limited to the well-mixed condition and unable to evaluate airborne infection risk spatially and temporally, which could result in overestimation or underestimation of airborne infection risk. This study proposes a dilution-based evaluation method for airborne infection risk. The method proposed is benchmarked by the Wells-Riley model and modified Wells-Riley model, which indicates that the method proposed is a thorough expansion of the Wells-Riley model for evaluation of airborne infection risk with both spatial and temporal resolutions.

370,"Intra-county modeling of COVID-19 infection with human mobility: assessing spatial heterogeneity with business traffic, age and race","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic and social challenges that continue to escalate. Meta-population epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health and shaping policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. Whats more, variation of intra-county environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different sub-regions. To address this issue, we develop a new human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behavior. This new modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and human mobility, business foot-traffic, race & ethnicity, and age-group are then investigated. The results reveal that in a college town (Dane County) the most important heterogeneity is spatial, while in a large city area (Milwaukee County) ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate on various reopening policies, which suggests that policymakers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and reopening.",Xiao Hou; Song Gao; Qin Li; Yuhao Kang; Nan Chen; Kaiping Chen; Jinmeng Rao; Jordan S.

371,Updating Herd Immunity Models for the U.S. in 2020: Implications for the COVID-19 Response,"ObjectivesTo understand what levels of herd immunity are required in the COVID-19 pandemic, given spatial population heterogeneity, to best inform policy and action.

MethodsUsing a network of counties in the United States connected by transit data we considered a set of coupled differential equations for susceptible-infectious-removed populations. We calculated the classical herd immunity level plus a version reflecting the heterogeneity of connections in the network by running the model forward in time until the epidemic completed.

ResultsNecessary levels of herd immunity vary greatly from county to county. A population weighted average for the United States is 47.5% compared to a classically estimated level of 77.1%.

ConclusionsCommon thinking argues that the nation needs to achieve at least 60% herd immunity to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterogeneity in contact structure and individual variation in infectivity, susceptibility, and resistance are key factors that reduce the disease-induced herd immunity levels to 34.2-47.5% in our models. Looking forward toward vaccination strategies, these results suggest we should consider not just who is vaccinated but where those vaccinations will do the most good.",Natalie Elizabeth Sheils; Gregory D Lyng; Ethan M Berke,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207100,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207100,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True

In particular, I study the predicted cases and deaths fitted to data from March and its potential application to data in September. The data is observed to fit the model as predicted until around 150 days after December 31, 2019, after which many countries lift their lockdowns and begin to reopen. A plateau in cases followed by an increase approximately 1.5 months after is also observed. In terms of deaths, the data fits the shape of the model, but the model mostly underestimates the death toll after around 160 days. An analysis of the residuals is provided to locate the precise date of the departure of each country from its accepted data estimates and test each data point to its predicted value using a Z-test to determine whether each observation can fit the given model.

In this paper, we present a data-informed approach for building stochastic compartmental models that is grounded in the Markovian processes underlying these models. Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model - susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) - is not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions, implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization (H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V). Using the proposed model, we characterize delay distributions analytically and match model parameters to empirical quantities in the data to obtain a good model fit.

Outcomes were parent-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family life, concerns and trust in political measures.

ResultsMost families were concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic and lock-down measures, with major concerns directed towards the economic situation (>70%), the health of close-ones (37%), but less towards their own health (<10%). Many concerns, seeking information and approval of federal measures were more pronounced in the more affected region. Approval of lockdown measures and concerns about economic recession were related to regional differences and not significantly dependent on educational status or being personally affected by the disease.

375,Vulnerability and burden of all-cause mortality associated with particulate air pollution increased during COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide observed study in Italy,"BackgroundLimited evidence is available on the health effects of particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5m; PM10, < 10m; PM2.5-10, 2.5-10m) during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Italy.

ObjectivesTo examine the associations between all-cause mortality and daily PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 in the pandemic period, and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019) in Italy.

MethodsWe collected daily data regarding all-cause (stratified by age and gender), and PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak (March to May in 2020) and the same months in 2015-2019. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods.

ResultsOverall, Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in 2020 pandemic period compared to same months of 2015-2019. Mortality effects were significant in lag 0-3 days for PM2.5, lag 0-2 for PM10, and lag 0-1 for PM2.5-10. Each 10 {micro}g/m3 increase in PM was associated much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during 2020 pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 [increased mortality rate: 7.24 % (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45 % (95%C: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10, 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10]. The counts and fractions of deaths attributable to PM were higher in 2020 than the normal periods for PM2.5 (attributable death counts: 20,062 in 2020 versus 3,927 per year in 2015-2019; attributable fractions: 10.2% versus 2.4%), PM10 (15,112 versus 3,999; 7.7% versus 2.5%), and PM2.5-10 (7,193 versus 2303; 3.7% versus 1.4%).

ConclusionsCOVID-19 pandemic increased the vulnerability and excess cases of all-cause mortality associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM10 in Italy, despite a decline in air pollution level. This suggests using historical PM-mortality association to calculate health benefits associated with reduction in PMs has big uncertainties.",Tingting Ye; Rongbin Xu; Wenhua Yu; Zhaoyue Chen; Yuming Guo; Shanshan Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20206052,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20206052,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
376,"An Agent Based Model for assessing spread and health systems burden for COVID-19 using a synthetic population in Telangana state, India","Objectives: To assess the transmission dynamics and the health systems burden of COVID-19 using an Agent Based Modeling (ABM) approach using a synthetic population. Study design: The study used a synthetic population with 31,738,240 agents representing 90.67 percent of the overall population of Telangana state, India as per 2011 Census of India. Lockdown phases as per Indian scenario considering the effects of post-lockdown, use of control measures and immunity on secondary infections were studied. District-level localized parameters were assigned to agents as local models prove to be much helpful for policymakers. Methods: The counts of people in different health states were measured separately for each district of Telangana. The model was run for 365 days and six scenarios with varying proportions of people using control measures (100%, 75% and 50%) and varying immunity periods of recovered patients (90 and 180 days). Results: Results indicate that the peak values were attained soon after the lockdown was lifted. The risk estimates indicate that protection factor values are higher when more proportion of people adopt control measures such as use of face mask and social distancing. Population Attributable Risk values measured longitudinally indicated higher values like 60.41% and 47.18% when 75 percent of people followed control measures during lockdowns. Conclusions: ABM approach helps to analyze grassroot details compared to compartmental models. Risk estimates allows the policymakers to determine the protection offered, its strength and percentage of population shielded by use of control measures.",Narassima MS; Guru Rajesh Jammy; Sankarshana A; Rashmi Pant; Anbuudayasankar SP; Lincoln Choudhury; Vijay Yeldandi; Shubham Singh; Denny John,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206177,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20206177,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
377,"Scalable, effective, and rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated N95 respirators using germicidal ultra-violet C (UVC) irradiation device","ImportanceParticulate respirators such as N95 masks are an essential component of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers. This study describes a rapid and effective UVC irradiation system that would facilitate the safe re-use of N95 respirators and provides supporting information for deploying UVC for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo assess the inactivation potential of the proposed UVC germicidal device as a function of time by using 3M(R) 8211 - N95 particulate respirators inoculated with SARS-CoV-2.

DesignA germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose was developed and snippets (2.5cm2) of the 3M-N95 respirator were inoculated with 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 and were UV irradiated. Different exposure times were tested (0-164 seconds) by fixing the distance between the lamp (10 cm) and the mask while providing an exposure of at least 5.43 mWcm-2.

SettingThe current work is broadly applicable for healthcare-settings, particularly during a pandemic such as COVID-19.

ParticipantsNot applicable.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Primary measure of outcome was titration of infectious virus recovered from virus-inoculated respirator pieces after UVC exposure. Other measures included the method validation of the irradiation protocol, using lentiviruses (biosafety level-2 agent) and establishment of the germicidal UVC exposure protocol.

ResultsAn average of 4.38x103 PFUml-1(SD 772.68) was recovered from untreated masks while 4.44x102 PFUml-1(SD 203.67), 4.00x102 PFUml-1(SD 115.47), 1.56x102 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) and 4.44x101 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) was recovered in exposures 2s,6s,18s and 54 seconds per side respectively. The germicidal device output and positioning was monitored and a minimum output of 5.43 mWcm-2 was maintained. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by plaque assays (minimal level of detection is 67 PFUml-1) on N95 respirator snippets when irradiated for 120s per side or longer suggesting 3.5 log reduction in 240 seconds of irradiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceA scalable germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. UVC germicidal irradiation of N95 snippets inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 for 120s per side resulted in 100% (3.5 log in total) reduction of virus. These data support the reuse of N95 particle-filtrate apparatus upon irradiation with UVC and supports use of UVC-based decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID19 pandemic.",Raveen Rathnasinghe; Robert F Karlicek; Michael Schotsaert; Mattheos A Koffas; Brigitte Arduini; Sonia Jangra; Bowen Wang; Jason L.

378,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is found in conjunctival swabs and tears of COVID-19 patients. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues.

MethodsThe expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors.

FindingsOf 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was [~]13% (17/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) disinfection.

InterpretationsOur study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.

379,"Incidence and Case-Fatality Ratio of COVID-19 infection in relation to Tobacco Smoking, Population Density and Age Demographics in the USA : could Particulate Matter derived from Tobacco Smoking act as a Vector for COVID-19 transmission?","BACKGROUNDTobacco smoking is known to increase the risk for bacterial and viral respiratory infections and this also applies to second-hand smoking. Smoking has been shown to increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and the consequent risk for intra-tracheal ventilation in smokers. Tobacco smoking exposes the user and nearby individuals to very high concentrations of particulate matter in a short period of time. Genes appertaining to COVID-19 have been found adherent to particulate matter. Particulate matter has been shown to travel beyond the social distance of 2 metres up to 10 metres. COVID-19 related mortality has been linked to elevated atmospheric levels of the particulate matter, PM2.5. The aim of the study was to observe the incidence of infection rate and case fatality ratios in the USA, comparing States with partial bans on tobacco smoking, to States with more restrictive smoking regulation, exploring a possible link between smoke-related particulate matter and COVID-19 transmission.

METHODOLOGYTwo groups of USA States, differentiated by the degree of smoking legislative restrictions, had a number of variables compared. The incidence of COVID-19 infection, case-fatality ratio and testing frequency were obtained from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre. The degree of smoking bans in the USA States was obtained from the websites of the Nonsmokers Rights Foundation. The percentage of the State population which smokes was collected from the Centres of Disease Control database. Population density, Body Mass Index and population percentages of individuals 65+/75+years were obtained from databases concerning USA demographics.

RESULTSWith the available data there was no significant difference in COVID-19 testing prevalence between the partial smoking ban group and the more restrictive regulated group. The incidence of COVID-19 infection in the States with limited bans on tobacco smoking was 2046/100,000 (sd+/-827) while the infection incidence in States with more restrictive rulings on tobacco smoking was 1660/100,000 (sd+/-686) (p<0.038). The population percentage of smokers in States with minor limitations to smoking was 18.3% (sd+/-3.28), while States with greater smoking restrictions had a smoking population percentage of 15.2% (sd+/-2.68) (p<0.0006).

The two populations of both groups did not differ numerically (p<0.24) and numbered 157,820,000 in the partial smoking ban group and 161,439,356 in the more restrictive group. Population density correlated significantly with the case-fatality ratio (R=0.66 p<0.0001), as did the 75+year age group (R=0.29 p<0.04). Reflecting the possibility of trans-border transmission, the smoking status of adjacent partial smoking ban States may influence the COVID-19 incidence of bordering States (e.g. Utah) even if the smoking regulations of the latter were stricter than the former.

Other factors that could impact the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA such as the State case-fatality ratio, population density, population percentage with elevated body mass index and the percentage of the state population aged 65years or above did not show any significant difference between both groups of States.

CONCLUSIONStates in the USA with high levels of tobacco smoking and limited regulation had significantly higher rates of COVID-19 infection incidences than States with greater smoking restrictions. Population density and the age group of 75+years, showed a positive significant correlation with the case-fatality ratio. Besides the adverse effects of tobacco smoking on pulmonary defences, it would be interesting to explore the possibility of infection transmission via coronavirus-laden particulate matter from exhaled fumes derived from tobacco smoking.",Yves Muscat Baron,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206383,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206383,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
380,"Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Nepal: a multicenter, prospective cohort study","IntroductionThere is limited data on clinical course and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Nepal. Thus, it is imperative to characterize the features of this disease in the domestic context.

MethodologyWe identified all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to five different hospitals in Nepal from June 15 to July 15, 2020. We collected epidemiological, socio-cultural and clinicopathologic data, and stratified the patients based on their symptom status.

ResultsThe study included 220 patients with an overall median age of 31.5 (25-37) years, and 181 (82.3%) were males. 159 (72.3%) were asymptomatic, and 163 (74.1%) were imported cases. Of 217 patients with the available data, 110 (50.7%) reported their annual household income less than 2000 US dollars, and 122 (56.2%) practiced Pranayama (yogic rhythmic breathing techniques) regularly. Eight patients (3.6%) required supplemental oxygen and two patients (0.9%) died. None of the patients who practiced Pranayama regularly required supplemental oxygen. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had greater proportion of females (31.1% vs. 12.6%, p=0.001), imported cases (85.2% vs. 69.8%, p=0.02), illiterates (26.8% vs. 12.1%, p=0.01), alcohol users (43.3% vs. 24.5%, p=0.01), patients feeling stigmatized by society (45.8% vs. 22.6%, p=0.001), and had higher platelet count (253x 109/L vs. 185x109/L, p=0.02).

ConclusionsMost cases were imported, asymptomatic young males, with very few deaths. Pranayama practice was associated with protection against severe COVID-19, but more data is needed to substantiate this.

381,Which factors should be included in triage? An online survey of the attitudes of the UK general public to pandemic triagedilemmas,"ObjectiveAs cases of COVID-19 infections surge, concerns have renewed about intensive care units (ICU) being overwhelmed and the need for specific triage protocols over winter. This study aimed to help inform triage guidance by exploring the view of lay people about factors to include in triage decisions.

Design, setting and participantsOnline survey between 29th May and 22nd June 2020 based on hypothetical triage dilemmas. Participants recruited from existing market research panels, representative of the UK general population. Scenarios were presented in which a single ventilator is available, and two patients require ICU admission and ventilation. Patients differed in one of: chance of survival, life expectancy, age, expected length of treatment, disability, and degree of frailty. Respondents were given the option of choosing one patient to treat, or tossing a coin to decide.

ResultsSeven hundred and sixty-three participated. A majority of respondents prioritized patients who would have a higher chance of survival (72-93%), longer life expectancy (78-83%), required shorter duration of treatment (88-94%), were younger (71-79%), or had a lesser degree of frailty (60-69% all p< .001). Where there was a small difference between two patients, a larger proportion elected to toss a coin to decide which patient to treat. A majority (58-86%) were prepared to withdraw treatment from a patient in intensive care who had a lower chance of survival than another patient currently presenting with COVID-19. Respondents also indicated a willingness to give higher priority to healthcare workers and to patients with young children.

ConclusionMembers of the UK general public potentially support a broadly utilitarian approach to ICU triage in the face of overwhelming need. Survey respondents endorsed the relevance of patient factors currently included in triage guidance, but also factors not currently included. They supported the permissibility of reallocating treatment in a pandemic.

382,Pathogenesis-based pre-exposure prophylaxis associated with low risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers at a designated Covid-19 hospital,"At present, no agents are known to be effective in preventing Covid-19. Based on current knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might be attenuated by directly maintaining innate pulmonary redox, metabolic and dilation functions using well-tolerated medications that are known to serve these functions, specifically, using a low dose aerosolized combination of glutathione, inosine and potassium. From June 1 to July 10, 2020, we conducted a low-intervention open-label single-centre study to evaluate safety and efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the aerosolized combination medications (ACM) on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in 99 healthcare workers (HCWs) at a hospital that was designated to treat Covid-19 patients. We also retrospectively compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the ACM users to that in 268 untreated HCWs at the same hospital. Eligible participants received an aerosolized combination of 21.3 mg/ml glutathione, 8.7 mg/ml inosine in 107 mM potassium solution for 14 days. The main outcome was the frequency of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, defined as individuals with positive genetic or immunological tests within 28 days of the study period. During the PrEP period, solicited adverse events occurred in five participants; all were mild and transient reactions. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2 ACM users (2%, 95% CI: 0.3% to 7.1%), which was significantly less than the incidence in 24 nonusers (9%, 95% CI: 5.8% to 13.0%; P = 0.02). Our findings might be used either to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, or to support ongoing and new research into more effective treatments for Covid-19.

383,Highly Effective Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Conjugated Polymers and Oligomers,"The current Covid-19 Pandemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus has proven extremely difficult to prevent or control. Currently there are few treatment options and very few long-lasting disinfectants available to prevent the spread. While masks and protective clothing and ""social distancing"" may offer some protection, their use has not always halted or slowed the spread. Several vaccines are currently undergoing testing; however there is still a critical need to provide new methods for inactivating the virus before it can spread and infect humans. In the present study we examined the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by synthetic conjugated polymers and oligomers developed in our laboratories as antimicrobials for bacteria, fungi and non-enveloped viruses. Our results show that we can obtain highly effective light induced inactivation with several of these oligomers and polymers including irradiation with near-UV and visible light. With both the oligomers and polymers, we can reach several logs of inactivation with relatively short irradiation times. Our results suggest several applications involving the incorporation of these materials in wipes, sprays, masks and clothing and other Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) that can be useful in preventing infections and the spreading of this deadly virus and future outbreaks from similar viruses.",Kirk S Schanze; David G Whitten; Alison M Kell; Eva Y Chi; Linnea K Ista; Florencia A Monge; Pradeepkumar Jagadesan; Virginie Bondu; Patrick L Donabedian,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204164,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204164,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
384,Consideration for the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"ObjectiveWorldwide countries are experiencing viral load in their population, leading to potential infectivity of asymptomatic COVID-19. Current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the role of asymptomatic infection worldwide reported in family-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers.

DesignOnline literature search (PubMed, Google Scholar, medRixv, and BioRixv) was accomplished using standard Boolean operators, studies published till 07th June 2020.

SettingStudies were included from case reports, short communication, and retrospective to cover sufficient asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission reported.

ParticipantsFamilial-clusters, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers.

ResultsWe observed asymptomatic transmission among familial-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers with a proportion of 32% 37%, 26%, 6%, and 32%, respectively. This study observed an overall proportion of 31% (95%CI: 0.19-0.44) with heterogeneity of I2 (97.28%, p=<0.001) among all asymptomatic populations mentioned in this study. Among children and healthcare workers, this study showed no heterogeneity; to overcome the interpretation from a fixed model, the random effect model was also applied to estimate the average distribution across studies included in the meta-analysis.

ConclusionWe found and suggest the rigorous epidemiological history, early isolation, social distancing, and increased quarantine period (at least 28 days) after screening asymptomatic cases as well as their close contacts for chest CT scan even after their negative nucleic acid testing to minimize the spread among the community. This systematic review and meta-analysis support asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission between person to person depending on the variation of virus incubation period among individuals. Children especially, school-going aged <18 years, need to be monitored and prevention strategy, e.g., chest CT and social distancing required to prevent the community transmission of COVID-19 in asymptomatic mode.

It is now clear that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by respiratory microdroplets expelled by infected persons, which can become suspended in the air. Several layering technologies are being explored to mitigate indoor transmission in the hopes of re-opening business, schools and transportation systems. Here we coupled the water adsorptive and photocatalytic capacity of novel Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to demonstrate the capture and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2.

386,Epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses in hospitals in a Chinese city during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus first broke out in China in early 2020. The early symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. Therefore, during the epidemic, patients with similar symptoms will be tested for multiple pathogens at the same time. In order to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, China has taken many measures. Under this special situation, have the types and epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses changed? The nucleic acid test results of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as the antibody test results of 8 common respiratory viruses of Jinan Central Hospital were collected before and after the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and age distribution and time distribution characteristics were statisticed. Furthermore the epidemiological characteristics of this new virus before and after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was compared. In the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus nucleic acid test samples were large, and the positive rate of the three viruses was high. After that, the sample size and positive rate decreased significantly. No co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was found in our hospital. The sample size before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was larger than that after the outbreak, but the positive rate of the outbreak was lower than that after the outbreak. And the infection rate of children decreased in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. This is because since January 23, in order to prevent the spread of the new crown epidemic, my country has adopted measures such as wearing masks, not gathering together, and quarantining at home. This not only prevents the spread of the new crown virus, but also prevents the common respiratory tract. The spread of the virus has reduced the incidence of residents.",Weihua Yang; Jian Chen; Mingjie Xu; Jun Wang; Huanjie Li; Yunshan Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207589,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207589,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,True
387,An in-depth investigation of the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,"BACKGROUNDIn-depth investigations of the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed.

METHODIn a phase I randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial involving 192 healthy adults 18-59 years of age, two injections of three different doses (50 EU, 100 EU and 150 EU) of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or the placebo were administered intramuscularly with a 2- or 4-week interval between the injections. The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated within 28 days.

FINDINGIn this study, 191 subjects assigned to three doses groups or the placebo group completed the 28-day trial. There were 44 adverse reactions within the 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue, and no abnormal variations were observed in 48 cytokines in the serum samples of immunized subjects. The serum samples diluted from 1:32 to 1:4096 and incubated with the virus did not show antibody-dependent enhancement effects (ADEs) with regard to human natural killer cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. At day 14, the seroconversion rates had reached 92%, 100% and 96% with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.0, 54.5 and 37.1, and at day 28, the seroconversion rates had reached 80%, 96% and 92% with GMTs of 10.6, 15.4 and 19.6in 0, 14 and 0, 28 procedures, respectively. Seroconversion was associated with the synchronous upregulation of ELISA antibodies against the S protein, N protein and virion and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Transcriptome analysis shaped the genetic diversity of immune response induced by the vaccine.

INTERPRETATIONIn a population aged 18-59 years, this inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was safe and immunogenic.

388,Systematic discovery and functional interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA-host protein interactions during infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a pandemic with growing global mortality. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular pathways required for host infection and anti-viral immunity. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during active infection. Integration of this data with viral ChIRP-MS data from three other positive-sense RNA viruses defined pan-viral and SARS-CoV-2-specific host interactions. Functional interrogation of these factors with a genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the vast majority of viral RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and we identified known and novel anti-viral proteins that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Finally, our RNA-centric approach demonstrated a physical connection between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host mitochondria, which we validated with functional and electron microscopy data, providing new insights into a more general virus-specific protein logic for mitochondrial interactions. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform future studies to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, as well as nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.

389,Autoproteolytic Products of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein are Primed for Antibody Evasion and Virus Proliferation,"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most immunogenic of the structural proteins and plays essential roles in several stages of the virus lifecycle. It is comprised of two major structural domains: the RNA binding domain, which interacts with viral and host RNA, and the oligomerization domain which assembles to form the viral core. Here, we investigate the assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA, implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes autoproteolytic processing within the linker region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms. We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We used mass spectrometry to show that N binds to a monoclonal antibody raised against full-length N. No antibody interactions were detected for N proteoforms without C-terminal residues, therefore locating antigenic regions towards the C-terminus. We then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. We propose that the proteoforms generated via autoproteolysis evade antibody detection through removal of the antigenic C-terminus and facilitate interactions with structured RNA or cyclophilin thereby enabling the virus to proliferate.",Corinne A Lutomski; Tarick J El-Baba; Jani R Bolla; Carol V Robinson,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328112,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328112,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
390,GNS561 exhibits potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 through autophagy inhibition,"Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) has spread quickly worldwide, with more than 29 million cases and 920,000 deaths. Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack the autophagic process to allow their viral replication. One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Philippe Halfon; Eloine Bestion; Keivan Zandi; Julien Andreani; Jean-Pierre Baudoin; Bernard LA SCOLA; Jean-Louis Mege; Soraya Mezouar; Raymond F Schinazi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.327635,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.327635,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
391,Multi-Clonal Live SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro Neutralization by Antibodies Isolated from Severe COVID-19 Convalescent Donors,"The interactions between antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and protective immunity. To understand the differences between antibody responses in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and VH3-53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike. Finally, we used combinations of nAbs targeting different immune-sites to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires revealed that the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs. We demonstrate that severe COVID-19 is associated with unique BCR signatures and multi-clonal neutralizing responses that are relatively frequent in the population.

392,"The strength of a NES motif in the nucleocapsid protein of human coronaviruses is related to genus, but not to pathogenic capacity","Seven members of the Coronaviridae family infect humans, but only three (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) cause severe disease with a high case fatality rate. Using in silico analyses (machine learning techniques and comparative genomics), several features associated to coronavirus pathogenicity have been recently proposed, including a potential increase in the strength of a predicted novel nuclear export signal (NES) motif in the nucleocapsid protein.

Here, we have used a well-established nuclear export assay to experimentally establish whether the recently proposed nucleocapsid NESs are capable of mediating nuclear export, and to evaluate if their activity correlates with coronavirus pathogenicity.

The six NES motifs tested were functional in our assay, but displayed wide differences in export activity. Importantly, these differences in NES strength were not related to strain pathogenicity. Rather, we found that the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus were markedly stronger than the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus.

We conclude that, while some of the genomic features recently identified in silico could be crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity, this does not appear to be the case of nucleocapsid NES activity, as it is more closely related to coronavirus genus than to pathogenic capacity.",Maria Sendino; Miren Josu Omaetxebarria; Jose A Rodriguez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328138,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328138,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
393,Structural basis for repurposing a 100-years-old drug suramin for treating COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic by non-stop infections of SARS-CoV-2 has continued to ravage many countries worldwide. Here we report the discovery of suramin, a 100-year-old drug, as a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. The 2.6 [A] cryo-EM structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites of suramin, with one site directly blocking the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clash with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells. These results provide a structural mechanism for the first non-nucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and a rationale for repurposing suramin for treating COVID-19.

394,Cytoplasmic short linear motifs in ACE2 and integrin beta3 link SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptors to endocytosis and autophagy,"The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enters the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Concomitantly, evidence is pointing to the involvement of additional host cell receptors, such as integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin {beta}3 contain a plethora of predicted binding motifs. Here, we confirm the functionality of some of these motifs through affinity measurements. The class I PDZ binding motif in the ACE2 cytoplasmic tail binds the first PDZ domain of the scaffold protein NHERF3. The clathrin-adaptor subunit AP2 2 interacts with an endocytic motif in the ACE2 with low affinity and the interaction is abolished by phosphorylation of Tyr781. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of integrin b3 contains a LC3-interacting region, and its interaction with ATG8 domains is enhanced by phosphorylation. Together, our data provides possible molecular links between host cell receptors and endocytosis and autophagy.

395,SARS-CoV-2 infection damages airway motile cilia and impairs mucociliary clearance,"Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads within the respiratory tract is important to define the parameters controlling the severity of COVID-19. We examined the functional and structural consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model. SARS-CoV-2 replication caused a transient decrease in epithelial barrier function and disruption of tight junctions, though viral particle crossing remained limited. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication led to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss and misorientation of remaining basal bodies. The motile cilia function was compromised, as measured in a mucociliary clearance assay. Epithelial defense mechanisms, including basal cell mobilization and interferon-lambda induction, ramped up only after the initiation of cilia damage. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters further demonstrated the loss of motile cilia in vivo. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma.",Rémy Robinot; Mathieu Hubert; Guilherme Dias de Melo; Françoise Lazarini; Timothée Bruel; Nikaïa Smith; Sylvain Levallois; Florence Larrous; Julien Fernandes; Stacy Gellenoncourt; Stéphane Rigaud; Olivier Gorgette; Catherine Thouvenot; Céline Trébeau; Guillaume Dumenil; Adeline Mallet; Samy Gobaa; Raphaël Etournay; Pierre-Marie Lledo; Marc Lecuit; Hervé Bourhy; Darragh Duffy; Vincent Michel; Olivier Schwartz; Lisa A Chakrabarti,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328369,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328369,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False
396,Sub-second heat inactivation of coronavirus,"Heat treatment denatures viral proteins that comprise the virion, making virus incapable of infecting a host. Coronavirus (CoV) virions contain single-stranded RNA genomes with a lipid envelope and 4 proteins, 3 of which are associated with the lipid envelope and thus are thought to be easily denatured by heat or surfactant-type chemicals. Prior studies have shown that a temperature of as low as 75 {degrees}C and treatment duration of 15 min can effectively inactivate CoV. The applicability of a CoV heat inactivation method greatly depends on the length of time of a heat treatment and the temperature needed to inactivate the virus. With the goal of finding conditions where sub-second heat exposure of CoV can sufficiently inactivate CoV, we designed and developed a simple system that can measure sub-second heat inactivation of CoV. The system is composed of capillary stainless-steel tubing immersed in a temperature-controlled oil bath followed by an ice bath, through which virus solution can be flowed at various speeds. Flowing virus solution at different speeds, along with a real-time temperature monitoring system, allows the virus to be accurately exposed to a desired temperature for various durations of time. Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a beta-coronavirus, as a model system, we identified that 85.2 {degrees}C for 0.48 s exposure is sufficient to obtain > 5 Log10 reduction in viral titer (starting titer: 5 x 107 PFU/mL), and that when exposed to 83.4 {degrees}C for 0.95 s, the virus was completely inactivated (zero titer, > 6 Log10 reduction).

IMPORTANCEThree coronaviruses (CoVs) have now caused global outbreaks within the past 20 years, with the COVID19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 still ongoing. Methods that can rapidly inactivate viruses, especially CoVs, can play critical roles in ensuring public safety and safeguarding personal health. Heat treatment of viruses to inactive them can be an efficient and inexpensive method, with the potential to be incorporated into various human-occupied spaces. In this work, a simple system that can heat-treat viruses for extremely short period was developed and utilized to show that sub-second exposure of CoV to heat is sufficient to inactivate CoV. This opens up the possibility of developing instruments and methods of disinfecting CoV in diverse settings, including rapid liquid disinfection and airborne virus disinfection. The developed method can also be broadly utilized to assess heat sensitivity of viruses other viral pathogens of interest and develop sub-second rapid heat inactivation approaches.",Yuqian Jiang; Han Zhang; Jose A.

Thanks to new genetic association studies additional risk factors are now being discovered. Using data from a recent genome-wide associations from the Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care (GenOMICC) consortium, we show that a haplotype at a region associated with requiring intensive care is inherited from Neandertals. It encodes proteins that activate enzymes that are important during infections with RNA viruses. As compared to the previously described Neandertal risk haplotype, this Neandertal haplotype is protective against severe COVID-19, is of more moderate effect, and is found at substantial frequencies in all regions of the world outside Africa.",Hugo Zeberg; Svante Paabo,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.327197,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.327197,2020-10-06,2020-10-06,,False

To investigate the statistical, rather than physiological basis of such warnings, this study examines correlations on a nation-by-nation basis between the statistical data concerning covid-19 fatalities among the populations of the ninety-nine countries with the greatest number of SARS-Cov-2 infections plus the statistics of potential co-morbidities that may influence the severity of the infections.

399,Proteolytic activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1/S2 site: a re-evaluation of furin cleavage,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2 site is known to activate the S protein for viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which expands viral tropism to lung cells. Here, we analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in related CoVs and offer thoughts on the implications of SARS-CoV-2s unique insert on its origin. We also utilized viral pseudoparticles to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential for plasma membrane entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for endosomal entry Vero E6 cells, a model cell culture line, and that other proteases in addition to furin are responsible for processing SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2.",Tiffany Tang; Javier A.

401,Design Of A Rapid And Reversible Fluorescence Assay To Detect COVID-19 And Other Pathogens,"We describe a rapid and reusable biophysical method to assay COVID-19 and other pathogens. The method uses fluorescent sensors (i.e. molecular beacons) designed to detect COVID-19 RNA or any RNA of interest, concurrent with an internal control without the need for amplification. The molecular beacons are stem-loop structures in which a [~]10 nucleotide loop region has the complementary sequence of a region of the target RNA, and a fluorophore and quencher are placed on the 5 and 3 ends of the stem. The energy of hybridization of the loop with its target is designed to be greater than the hybridization energy of the energy of the stem so that when the beacon encounters its target RNA, the structure opens resulting in dequenching of the fluorophore. Here, we designed a COVID-19 beacon that is completely quenched in its native form and undergoes a 50-fold increase in fluorescence when exposed to nanomolar amounts of synthetic viral oligonucleotide. No changes in intensity are seen when control RNA is added. A control beacon to a human GAPDH RNA, chosen for its high levels in saliva, behaved similar to the COVID-19 beacon. This increase in fluorescence with beacon opening can be completely reversed upon addition of single stranded DNA complementary to COVID-19 beacon loop region. Beacons can be attached to an insert matrix allowing their use in concentrated form and can be made from morphilino oligonucleotides that are resistant to RNases. We present an analysis of the parameters that will allow the development of test strips to detect virus in aerosol, body fluids and community waste.

Using all patients diagnosed on testing in a single regional laboratory, we identified 1137 subjects with PCR positive for SARS-COV2 and at least one available complete blood count from the decade prior to any possible exposure to the virus. Bivariate analysis indicated an association between pre-existing lymphocytopenia (defined as absolute lymphocyte count <0.9x109 /L) and fatality (18% versus 4%). Furthermore, a logistic regression model, accounting for both patient age and number of blood counts obtained, indicated the subjects with pre-existing lymphocytopenia were 1.4 times as likely to die.

We integrated 4,780 blood transcriptome profiles from patients infected with one of 16 viruses across 34 independent cohorts from 18 countries, and 71 scRNA-seq profiles of 264,224 immune cells across three independent cohorts. We found a myeloid cell-dominated conserved host response associated with severity. It showed increased hematopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells with increased severity. We identified four gene modules that delineate distinct trajectories associated with mild and severe outcomes, and show the interferon response was decoupled from protective host response during severe viral infection. These modules distinguished non-severe from severe viral infection with clinically useful accuracy.

404,Comparing biomarkers for COVID-19 disease with commonly associated preexisting conditions and complications.,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with certain preexisting health conditions and can cause respiratory failure along with other multi-organ injuries. However, the mechanism of these relationships is unclear, and prognostic biomarkers for the disease and its systemic complications are lacking. This study aims to examine the plasma protein profile of COVID-19 patients and evaluate overlapping protein modules with biomarkers of common comorbidities.

Blood samples were collected from COVID-19 cases (n=307) and negative controls (n=78) among patients with acute respiratory distress. Proteins were measured by proximity extension assay utilizing next-generation sequencing technology. Its associations to COVID-19 disease characteristics were compared to that of preexisting conditions and established biomarkers for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and chronic kidney disease.

Several proteins were differentially expressed in COVID-19, including multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-{gamma}, CXCL10, and CCL7/MCP-3. Elevated IL-6 was associated with increased severity, while baseline IL1RL1/ST2 levels were associated with a worse prognosis. Network analysis identified several protein modules associated with COVID-19 disease characteristics overlapping with processes of preexisting hypertension and impaired kidney function. BNP and NTpro-BNP, markers for MI and stroke, increased with disease progression and were positively associated with severity. MMP12 was similarly elevated and has been previously linked to smoking and inflammation in emphysema, along with increased cardiovascular disease risk.

406,"Investigating the potential benefit that requiring travellers to self-isolate on arrival may have upon the reducing of case importations during international outbreaks of influenza, SARS, Ebola virus disease and COVID-19","With the advent of rapid international travel, disease can now spread between nations faster than ever. As such, when outbreaks occur in foreign states, pressure mounts to reduce the risk of importing cases to the home nation. In a previous paper, we developed a model to investigate the potential effectiveness of deploying screening at airports during outbreaks of influenza, SARS, and Ebola. We also applied the model to the current COVID-19 outbreak. This model simulated the testing of travellers (assumed not to be displaying symptoms prior to boarding their flight) as they arrived at their destination. The model showed that the reduction in risk of case importation that screening alone could deliver was minimal across most scenarios considered, with outputs indicating that screening alone could detect at most 46.4%, 12.9%, and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and Ebola respectively, while the model also reported a detection rate of 12.0% for COVID-19. In this paper, we present a brief modification to this model allowing us to assess the added impact that quarantining incoming travelers for various periods may have on reducing the risk of case importation. Primary results show that requiring all travellers to undergo 5 days of self-isolation on arrival, after which they are tested again, has the potential to increase rates of detection to 100%, 87.6%, 81.7% and 41.3% for travellers infected with influenza, SARS, COVID-19 and Ebola respectively. Extending the period of self-isolation to 14 days increases these potential detection rates to 100%, 100%, 99.5% and 91.8% respectively.",Declan Bays; Emma Bennett; Thomas Finnie,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205757,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205757,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
407,Benchmarking COVID-19 Mortality in the United States,"On September 22nd the US officially recorded 200,000 COVID-19 deaths. It is unclear how many deaths might have been expected in the case of an early and effective response to the pandemic. We aim to provide a best-case estimate of COVID-19 deaths in the US by September 22nd using the experience of Germany as a benchmark. Our methods accommodate the differences in demographics between Germany and the US. We match cumulative incidence of COVID-19 deaths by age group in Germany to non-Hispanic whites in the US and project the implied number of deaths in this population and among the black and Hispanic populations under observed racial/ethnic disparities in cumulative COVID-19 mortality in the US. We estimate that if the US had been as successful as Germany in managing the pandemic we would have expected 22% of the deaths actually recorded. The number of deaths would have been lower by a further one-third if we could have eliminated racial/ethnic disparites in COVID-19 outcomes. We conclude that almost 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in the US by September 22nd could have been avoided with an early and effective response producing similar age-specific death rates among non-Hispanic whites as in Germany.",Ruth Etzioni; Elan Markowitz; Ivor S Douglas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204586,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204586,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
408,Metabolic syndrome increases COVID-19-related mortality in the UK Biobank sample,"Previous studies link obesity and individual components of metabolic syndrome to increased hospitalisations and death rates of patients with COVID-19. Here, in two overlapping samples of over 1,000 individuals from the UK Biobank we investigate whether metabolic syndrome, and its constituent components, increased waist circumference, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and systemic inflammation, are related to increased COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Using logistic regression and controlling for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, age, sex or ethnicity, we find that individuals with pre-existing metabolic syndrome (measured on average eleven years prior to 2020) have an increased risk for COVID-19-related death (odds ratio 1.67). We also find that specific factors contributing to increased mortality are serum glucose levels, systolic blood pressure and waist circumference.",Filip Morys; Alain Dagher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205716,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205716,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
409,In vitro efficacy of Artemisinin-based treatments against SARS-CoV-2,"Effective and affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are needed. We report in vitro efficacy of Artemisia annua extracts as well as artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether against SARS-CoV-2. The latter two are approved active pharmaceutical ingredients of anti-malarial drugs.

Proof-of-concept for prophylactic efficacy of the extracts was obtained using a plaque-reduction assay in VeroE6 cells. Subsequent concentration-response studies using a high-throughput antiviral assay, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed that pretreatment and treatment with extracts, artemisinin, and artesunate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. In treatment assays, artesunate (50% effective concentration (EC50): 7 g/mL) was more potent than the tested plant extracts (128-260 g/mL) or artemisinin (151 g/mL) and artemether (>179 g/mL), while generally EC50 in pretreatment assays were slightly higher. The selectivity index (SI), calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, was highest for artemisinin (54), and roughly equal for the extracts (5-10), artesunate (6) and artemether (<7). Similar results were obtained in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. Peak plasma concentrations of artesunate exceeding EC50 values can be achieved.

410,A national study of self-reported COVID symptoms during the first viral wave in Canada,"ImportanceAccurate understanding of COVID pandemic during the first viral wave in Canada could help prepare for future epidemic waves.

ObjectiveTo track the early course of the pandemic by examining self-reported COVID symptoms over time before testing became widely available.

DesignAdults from the nationally representative Angus Reid Forum were randomly invited to complete an online survey in May/June 2020. The study is a part of the Action to Beat Coronavirus antibody testing study.

SettingA 20-item internet survey.

Participants14,408 adults age 18 years of age.

ExposuresThe months that respondents and any household members first experienced various respiratory, neurological, sleep, skin or gastric symptoms.

Main Outcomes and Measure""COVID symptom-positive,"" defined as fever (or fever with hallucinations) plus at least one of difficulty breathing, a dry severe cough, loss of smell or ""COVID toe.""

ResultsIn total, 14,408 panel members (48% male and 52% female) completed the survey. Despite overrepresentation of higher levels of education, the prevalence of obesity, smoking, diabetes and hypertension were similar to national census and health surveys. A total of 811 (5.6%) were COVID symptom-positive; highest rates were at ages 18-44 years (8.3% among), declining at older ages. Females had higher odds of reporting COVID symptoms (OR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.11 - 1.56) as did visible minorities (OR = 1.74, 1.29 - 2.35). COVID symptom positivity for respondents and their household members peaked in March (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.59 - 2.34 compared to earlier months).

412,Validation of self-collected buccal swab and saliva as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19,"BackgroundEffective management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires large-scale testing. Collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) by healthcare workers (HCW) is currently used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of transmission to HCWs. Self-administered saliva and buccal swabs are convenient, painless and safe alternative sample collection methods.

MethodsA cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 participants who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS within the past 7 days. A self-collected saliva and buccal swab and a HCW-collected NPS were obtained. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for saliva and buccal swabs, as compared with NPS.

ResultsAmong the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7% and OA 69.0%. The buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100% and OA 73.8%. Presence of symptoms improved diagnostic accuracy. There was no statistically significant association between CT values and duration of symptom onset within the first 12 days of symptoms for all three modalities.

ConclusionSelf-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs have only moderate agreement with HCW-collected NPS swabs. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives. This combined strategy minimizes discomfort and reduces the risk of spread to the community and HCWs.",Chee Wai Ku; Shivani Durai; Jacqueline Q T Kwan; See Ling Loy; Christina Erwin; Karrie K K Ko; Xiang Wen Ng; Lynette Oon; Koh Cheng Thoon; Shirin Kalimuddin; Jerry KY Chan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205278,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.20205278,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True

To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019.

MethodsA matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age [&ge;] 18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to 5 non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020.

ResultsAmong 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18%) were hospitalized, 107 (4%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3%) died. The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 0.99 (95% Confidence Internal 0.80, 1.22) for hospitalization, 0.69 (95% Confidence Internal 0.36, 1.29) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.30 (95% Confidence Internal 0.11, 0.80) for death.

414,Early transfusion of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients with high titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG convalescent plasma confirms a signal of significantly decreased mortality,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains a global threat with few proven efficacious treatments. Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 disease has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity-score matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality. We here present results from 60-day follow up of our cohort of 351 transfused hospitalized patients. Prospective determination of ELISA anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recently FDA-required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma. In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.",Eric Salazar; Paul A.

415,Evaluating the Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines,"A large number of studies are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines against novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Most Phase 3 trials have adopted virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease as the primary efficacy endpoint, although laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest. In addition, it is important to evaluate the effect of vaccination on disease severity. To provide a full picture of vaccine efficacy and make efficient use of available data, we propose using SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 as dual or triple primary endpoints. We demonstrate the advantages of this strategy through realistic simulation studies. Finally, we show how this approach can provide rigorous interim monitoring of the trials and efficient assessment of the durability of vaccine efficacy.

416,Impact of pathogen reduction technologies on immunological propertiesof the COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"Background and ObjectivesIn the absence of a vaccine or specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 convalescent plasma became one of the experimental treatment options in many countries. Aim of this study was to assess the impact of different pathogen reduction technologies on the immunological properties of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

Materials and MethodsIn our experiment 140 doses of plasma collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction with one of three different methods: methylene blue (M), riboflavin (R), and amotosalen (A). To conduct a paired two-sample comparison each plasma dose was divided into 2 that were treated by one of these technologies. The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N-proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction.

ResultsAll methods reduced NtAbs titers significantly but not at the same grade: among units with the initial titre 80 or above, 81% of units had unchanged titres while 19% decreased by 1 step after methylene blue; 60% unchanged and 40% - decreased by 1 step after amotosalen; 43% unchanged, 67% a one-step decrease and 6% - a two-step decrease after riboflavin. Pairwise two-sample comparisons (M vs A, M vs R and A vs R) revealed the most prominent and statistically significant decrease in all studied parameters (except anti-RBD) following pathogen reduction with riboflavin.

Researchers have invested tremendous efforts to develop vaccines or effective drug therapy but have not yet been fruitful. Hence, we planned to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to supplement the readers with comprehensive data and credible information on the safety and efficacyof essential pharmacotherapy during the pharmacological management of COVID-19.

MethodsTheprotocol will be designed based on the updated PRISMA-P 2015 guidelines. An elaborate search of electronic databases such as PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, Medrxiv and other potential databases for articles published during January 2020 to 10 October 2020 is planned to be conducted. Following this,randomized control trials published in English language that assess the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy versusplacebo or standard of care or usual care will be evaluated for inclusion. The primary outcomes will include time to clinical recovery and the probability for the negative conversion of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes will quantifythe proportion of patients relieved of symptoms, the all-cause mortality, morbidity, detection of viral RNA, time needed to achieve a negative viral load, ordinal scale changes, ventilatorand oxygen requirements,length of hospital stayand the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events.RevMan V.5.3 computer software packages will be utilised to conduct an accurate statistical analysis of the study. Thebinary random-effects model will be used at a 95 % confidence interval to estimate the weighted effect size ofdichotomous data and continuous data studies. The results of statistical analysis will be considered statistically significant whena p-value <0.05 is attained.

ResultsSelected studies will be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy used during the management of the novel COVID-19.

ConclusionThis study will be a qualitative and quantitative pool of comprehensive evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy on COVID-19.

Combined metabolic cofactors supplementation (CMCS) consisting of L-serine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and L-carnitine tartrate is being studied for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

METHODSWe conducted a placebo-controlled, phase-2 clinical trial involving ambulatory COVID-19 patients. A total of 100 patients were randomly assigned on a 3:1 basis to hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS or hydroxychloroquine plus placebo. The total treatment period for the hydroxychloroquine was 5 days, and for the CMCS/placebo was 14 days. Clinical status was evaluated daily by phone, using a binomial scale for subject reported presence or absence for multiple COVID-19 related symptoms. Plasma samples for clinical chemistry analyses were collected on day 0 and day 14.

RESULTSA total of 93 patients completed the trial. The combination of CMCS and hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced the average complete recovery time compared with hydroxychloroquine and placebo (6.6 days vs 9.3 days, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in ALT, AST and LDH levels on day 14 compared to day 0 in the hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS group. The adverse effects were uncommon and self-limiting.

420,"An improved and readily available version of Bst DNA Polymerase for LAMP, and applications to COVID-19 diagnostics","Despite the fact that strand-displacing activity is of great utility for a variety of applications, including isothermal amplification assays, there are relatively few strand-displacing DNA polymerases. In particular, the thermotolerant DNA polymerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (previously Bacillus stearothermophilus), Bst DNA polymerase (Bst DNAP), is used in a variety of assays, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification. However, despite its wide use, its properties remain open to improvement, as has been demonstrated by a variety of engineering efforts, including the identification of point mutations that impact its robustness, strand-displacement capabilities, and nascent reverse transcriptase activity.

Interestingly, a strategy that has been commonly used to alter the capabilities of DNA polymerases, the addition of additional DNA- or RNA-binding domains, has yet to be applied to Bst DNAP. To this end, we now show that by adding fusion domains the performance of Bst DNAP in isothermal amplification assays, including its nascent RT activity, can be greatly improved.

421,Testing mobile air purifiers in a school classroom: Reducing the airborne transmission risk for SARS-CoV-2,"Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through virus-containing aerosol particles has been established as an important pathway for Covid-19 infection. Suitable measures to prevent such infections are imperative, especially in situations when a high number of persons convene in closed rooms. Here we tested the efficiency and practicability of operating four air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters in a high school classroom while regular classes were taking place. We monitored the aerosol number concentration for particles > 3 nm at two locations in the room, the aerosol size distribution in the range from 10 nm to 10 {micro}m, PM10 and CO2 concentration. For comparison, we performed similar measurements in a neighboring classroom without purifiers. In times when classes were conducted with windows and door closed, the aerosol concentration was reduced by more than 90 % within less than 30 minutes when running the purifiers (air exchange rate 5.5 h-1). The reduction was homogeneous throughout the room and for all particle sizes. The measurements are supplemented by a calculation estimating the maximum concentration levels of virus-containing aerosol from a highly contagious person speaking in a closed room with and without air purifiers. Measurements and calculation demonstrate that air purifiers represent a well suited measure to reduce the risks of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 substantially. Staying for two hours in a closed room with a super infective person, we estimate that the inhaled dose is reduced by a factor of six when using air purifiers with a total air exchange rate of 5.7 h-1.",Joachim Curtius; Manuel Granzin; Jann Schrod,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205633,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205633,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True

DesignThis is a retrospective, observational study. Forty-six out of 79 NICUs (58%) from 17 countries participated. Principal investigators were asked to report the following information: 1) Total number of EP infant admissions to their NICU in the three months where the lockdown restrictions were most rigorous during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) Similar EP infant admissions in the corresponding three months of 2019, 3) the level of local restrictions during the lockdown period and 4) the local impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the everyday life of a pregnant woman.

ResultsThere was no significant difference between the number of EP infant admissions during the three most rigorous lockdown months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the corresponding three months in 2019 (n=428 versus n=457 respectively, p=0.33). There were no significant changes within individual geographic regions and no significant association between the level of lockdown restrictions and change in the number of EP infant admissions (p=0.334).

423,Willingness of Nigerian residents to disclose COVID-19 symptoms and take COVID-19 test,"BackgroundAn understanding of willingness of people to disclose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and take the COVID-19 test will help provide important insight for motivators towards the self-surveillance and testing strategies recommended by the World Health Organization to curtail and halt the transmission of COVID-19.

ObjectivesThis study assessed willingness to disclose symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and willingness to take COVID-19 test as well as their predictors.

MethodsA cross-sectional online survey of 524 Nigerian adults, aged [&ge;] 18 years, residing in Nigeria and who had not taken the COVID-19 test was conducted. Information on willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms, take COVID-19 test and possible predictors were collected. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics evaluated at 5% significance level.

ResultsMean age of respondents was 35.8 {+/-} 10.7 years and 57.0% were males. Majority (85.8% and 86.2% respectively) were willing to disclose COVID-19 symptoms and take COVID-19 test. Self-risk perception of contracting COVID-19 predicted both willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=3.236; 95%CI=1.836-5.704) and take COVID-19 test (aOR=3.174; 95%CI=1.570-6.419). Willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=13.060; 95%CI= 6.253-27.276), knowledge of someone who had taken the test (aOR= 4.106; 95%CI= 1.179-14.299) and thought that it was important for people to know their COVID-19 status (aOR=3.123; 95%CI= 1.516-6.434) also predicted willingness to take COVID-19 test.

ConclusionNigerians are willing to disclose symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and take the COVID-19 test. Investment in interventions developed based on the predicting factors will help speed up the finding and testing of suspected COVID-19 cases.",Victoria Oluwabunmi Oladoyin; Oluyemi Adewole Okunlola; Oluwaseyi Kikelomo Israel; Demilade Olusola Ibirongbe; Joy Atonirehonmon Osifo; Taiwo Akinyode Obembe; Paulinus Kunle Omode; Olugbenga Olusegun Osunmakinwa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205914,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205914,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
424,Pooled Saliva Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Testing,"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or mid-turbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (N=380) and in the emergency department (ED) (N=69). The percent positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% CI: 65.8% - 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI: 98.7% - 100%), respectively. The sensitivity increased to 90.0% (95% CI: 74.4% - 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (Cycle threshold (Ct) for the NP <=34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms: bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche COBAS 6800. The median loss of signal upon pooling was 2-4 Ct values across the platforms. The sensitivity of detecting a positive specimen in a pool compared with testing individually was 100%, 93%, and 95% for CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR, Panther Fusion(R) SARS-CoV-2 assay, and cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 test respectively, with decreased sample detection trending with lower viral load. We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport media for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.",Bidisha Barat; Sanchita Das; Valeria De Giorgi; David K.

425,"COVID-19 Viral Loads, Environment, Ventilation, Masks, Exposure Time, And Severity : A Pragmatic Guide Of Estimates","Abstract, Introduction, Overview, PurposeThis study seeks to better understand how indoor ventilation improvements could offer significant protection against aerosol transmission of COVID-19. It compares the effects of infected person[s] shedding virus in multiple indoor and outdoor settings and estimates resulting infection potential at multiple severities based on exposure time. An attempt to find this information from online searches that included medical journals, private industry, and US government provided materials failed to find specific quantitative estimates and recommendations, which motivated this study.

Key information needed to perform this aerosolized viral load exposure time estimation analysis and clinical severity likelihood interpretation includes measured amounts of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients and known Influenza A challenge escalation doses; both of which are obtained from peer-reviewed and published studies. Information from ASHRAE Office Ventilation standards and an Outdoor Air Exchange model are also utilized.

While these estimations have unknown error margins and cannot be considered authoritative, they may have utility in comparing various environments and relative risk factors. The estimates in this study also present an initial framework and specific quantitative examples for better understanding of the effects of ventilation on aerosolized transmission, and the immunology related to graduated challenge doses, and the potential for low-level viral load exposure to result in some level of immunity without symptoms of illness (asymptomatic infection).

This study finds that outdoor environments reduce transmission risk by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to common indoor environments, that improved ventilation can reduce risk within indoor environments, and suggests that environments with diluted viral loads improves the probability of developing protective immunity while limiting symptoms and illness.

This studys multiple examples of specific quantitative viral load exposure levels versus symptoms and immune response, and simplified descriptions of the quantitative differences between protective vs pathologic exposure levels, could provide an intriguing inductive learning tool that protectively guides individual behavior within the general public.",David E.

426,Motif Analysis in k-mer Networks: An Approach towards Understanding SARS-CoV-2 Geographical Shifts,"With an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available day by day, new genomic information is getting revealed to us. As SARS-CoV-2 sequences highlight wide changes across the samples, we aim to explore whether these changes reveal the geographical origin of the corresponding samples. The k-mer distributions, denoting normalized frequency counts of all possible combinations of nucleotide of size upto k, are often helpful to explore sequence level patterns. Given the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are highly imbalanced by its geographical origin (relatively with a higher number samples collected from the USA), we observe that with proper under-sampling k-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences predict its geographical origin with more than 90% accuracy. The experiments are performed on the samples collected from six countries with maximum number of sequences available till July 07, 2020. This comprises SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Australia, USA, China, India, Greece and France. Moreover, we demonstrate that the changes of genomic sequences characterize the continents as a whole. We also highlight that the network motifs present in the sequence similarity networks have a significant difference across the said countries. This, as a whole, is capable of predicting the geographical shift of SARS-CoV-2.",Sourav Biswas; Suparna Saha; Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay; Malay Bhattacharyya,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325662,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325662,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,False
427,Religious affiliation and the risk of COVID 19 related mortality; a retrospective analysis of variation in pre and post lockdown risk by religious group in England and Wales.,"BackgroundCOVID 19 mortality risk is associated with demographic and behavioural factors; furthermore religious gatherings have been linked with the spread of COVID. We sought to understand the variation in the risk of COVID 19 related death across religious groups in the UK both before and after lockdown.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of usual residents in England and Wales enumerated at the 2011 Census (n = 48,422,583), for risk of death involving COVID-19 using linked death certificates. Cox regression models were estimated to compare risks between religious groups. Time dependent religion coefficients were added to the model allowing hazard ratios (HRs) pre and post lockdown period to be estimated separately.

ResultsCompared to Christians all religious groups had an elevated risk of death involving COVID-19; the largest age adjusted HRs were for Muslim and Jewish males at 2.5 (95% confidence interval 2.3-2.7) and 2.1 (1.9-2.5), respectively. The corresponding HRs for Muslim and Jewish females were 1.9 (1.7-2.1) and 1.5 (1.7-2.1). The difference in risk between groups contracted after lockdown. Those who affiliated with no religion had the lowest risk of COVID 19 related death before and after lockdown.

ConclusionThe majority of the variation in COVID 19 mortality risk was explained by controlling for socio demographic and geographic determinants; however, Jews remained at a higher risk of death compared to all other groups. Lockdown measures were associated with reduced differences in COVID 19 mortality rates between religious groups, further research is required to understand the causal mechanisms.",Charlotte Gaughan; Daniel Ayoubkhani; Vahe Nafilyan; Peter Goldblatt; Chris White; Karen Tingay; Neil Bannister,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20204495,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20204495,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,,True
428,RT qLAMP--Direct Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Raw Sewage,"The project purpose was to examine ability of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage, directly, using no preliminary sample processing for virus concentration and RNA extraction. An objective was to take advantage of extensive recently published work to facilitate process development, principally primer selection, and to use readily available off the shelf materials with conventional lab procedure and equipment. Well-developed and referenced primers for ORF1a, E, and N-gene targets were selected and applied, using commercially available synthetic RNA standards, and raw sewage from a local wastewater agency serving 650,000. County health department monitoring provided current COVID-19 data. Testing defined performance characteristics for each primer set, with significant differences between them. Specific amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed using each of the primer sets, with E-gene and N-gene primers most effective. Positive analysis results from all raw sewage samples corresponded to calculated concentrations of virus in 5-10 L raw sewage aliquots for 25 L reactions. Results show that even at low reported case rates e.g. 1-10/100,000, SARS-CoV-2 is present in raw sewage at > 1-5/ L, permitting direct LAMP-based detection. Use of RT qLAMP will facilitate wastewater-based epidemiology as an important component for COVID-19 control.",Jerry E Ongerth; Richard E Danielson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205492,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205492,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
429,COVID-19-lockdown impact and vulnerability factors on cognitive functioning and mental health,"The COVID-19 outbreak and its associated restrictive measures, such as lockdown, exposed most individuals to an unprecedented stressful situation, increasing worldwide the prevalence of mental health disorders.

Here, we aimed at exploring for the first time the effect of COVID-19-lockdown on subjective cognitive functioning as well as mental health, in terms of its prevalence and clinical severity. In addition, potential risk factors characterizing more vulnerable groups were investigated. A nationwide cross-sectional online-survey was conducted during the final phase of lockdown in Italy (after 7-10 weeks of home confinement), leading to a sample of 1215 participants.

We found lockdown can have a severe impact on subjective cognitive functioning, along with mental health disorders. Namely, under restrictions, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in everyday tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions; while no changes in language abilities were reported. Conversely, a paradoxical effect was observed in memory domain, with people experiencing a reduction of memory failures compared to pre-lockdown times.

Further, higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders and of other psychological issues (involving sleep, appetite, libido and hypochondria) were observed - with a prevalence of mild-to-severe depression and anxiety rising up to 32.30% and 35.72% respectively, under restrictions.

Being female, young (<45 years), repeatedly exposed to COVID-19-media, working from home or being unemployed were identified as relevant risk factors for experiencing cognitive worsening and mental health disorders, related to the COVID-19 lockdown. Being resident in high infection-prevalence areas was related to higher level of depression and health anxiety. As lockdown and quarantine measures could be reimposed, health officials have to carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decision-making process, to develop an effective global and long-term response to the mental health challenges of this pandemic as well as to implement psychological interventions and specific guidelines, particularly about COVID-19-media exposure.",Eleonora Fiorenzato; Silvia Zabberoni; Alberto Costa; Giorgia Cona,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205237,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205237,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
430,The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Uptake of Influenza Vaccine: A UK-Wide Observational Study,"ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to measure the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on acceptance of flu vaccination in the 2020-21 season, including for those newly eligible for the UK National Health Service (NHS) free vaccination programme, extended this year to include an estimated 32.4 million (48.8%) of the UK population. Knowing intended uptake is essential to inform supply and steer public health messaging to maximise vaccination given the combined threats of both flu and Covid-19 -- the unknown impact of which on both attitudes and the need for mass uptake yet again create the threat of ill-informed planning resulting in failure to meet necessary public health demand.

MethodsAn online questionnaire posing question items on influenza vaccination was administered to registrants of the Care Information Exchange (CIE), the NHSs largest patient electronic personal health record. This was part of a longitudinal study initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. This analysis was limited to those who, in line with established NHS criteria, were previously or newly eligible but had not routinely received seasonal influenza vaccination in the past. Groups were stratified by response (yes/no) to intending to receive flu vaccination in 2020-21: Group 1.) Previously eligible now responding  yes, 2.) Previously eligible still responding  no, 3.) Newly eligible responding  yes, and 4.) Newly eligible responding  no. Within these groups, response by health worker status and each groups inclination to vaccinate school age children was also measured. Summary statistics were reported alongside univariate and multivariable regression. Lastly, a network analysis visualised the frequency and co-occurrence of reasons qualifying response for or against influenza vaccination in 2020/21.

FindingsAmong 6,641 respondents, 4,040 (61.1%) had previously routinely received the flu vaccination. 1,624 (24.5%) had been either previously eligible but not vaccinated (945, 58.2%) or newly eligible (679, 41.8%). Among the previously eligible participants who had not routinely received influenza vaccination 536 (56.7%) responded they would in 2020-21, increasing the vaccination rate in the entire previously eligible cohort from 79.6% to 91.2%, and 466 (68.6%) in the newly eligible.

Multivariable logistic regression resulted in few substantial changes to effect estimates, with the exception of age, for which all estimates showed a stronger association with intention to receive the flu vaccine. In those who became newly eligible to receive the flu vaccine, there was an association between intention to receive the flu vaccine and increased age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12), IMD quintile, and considering oneself at high risk from Covid-19 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.70).

Network analysis showed the most frequent themes for previously eligible unvaccinated and newly eligible participants accepting vaccination in 2020/21 were:  precaution for myself (41.2% and 46.1%) and  Covid-19 (27.4% and 27.1%), where the former was qualified by the latter in 36% and 29.1% of responses. Among the previously and newly eligible not intending to receive vaccination in 2020/21, misinformed themes of  makes me unwell,  gives me flu and  vaccine doesnt work were present across 37.4% and 21.9% of responses, respectively.

Among participants with school age children, of those previously eligible who now intend to be vaccinated themselves, 82.5% also intend to vaccinate their children in 2020/21 compared to 25.8% of those who would not accept the influenza vaccine for themselves. Among the newly eligible respondents this was 82.1% and 43.5%, respectively. 49.9% of the previously unvaccinated healthcare workers would continue to decline the vaccine in 2020/21.

InterpretationIn this UK-wide observational study, Covid-19 has increased acceptance of flu vaccination in 2020/21 from 79.6% to 91.2% in those previously eligible, and for the 69% of those newly eligible. This high anticipated vaccination rate (to 26 million (80%) of the UK population) requires appropriate planning, but can be further increased with effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions about flu vaccination, which may also help in preparation for future Covid-19 vaccination. It remains of concern that 50% of healthcare professionals who refused it previously still do not intend to have the flu vaccine.",Patrik Bachtiger; Alex Adamson; Ji-Jian Chow; Rupa Sisodia; Jennifer K Quint; Nicholas S Peters,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205385,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205385,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
431,Racial-ethnic disparities in case fatality ratio narrowed after age standardization: A call for race-ethnicity-specific age distributions in State COVID-19 data,"ImportanceCOVID-19 racial disparities have gained significant attention yet little is known about how age distributions obscure racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 case fatality ratios (CFR).

ObjectiveWe filled this gap by assessing relevant data availability and quality across states, and in states with available data, investigating how racial-ethnic disparities in CFR changed after age adjustment.

Design/Setting/Participants/ExposureWe conducted a landscape analysis as of July 1st, 2020 and developed a grading system to assess COVID-19 case and death data by age and race in 50 states and DC. In states where age- and race-specific data were available, we applied direct age standardization to compare CFR across race-ethnicities. We developed an online dashboard to automatically and continuously update our results.

Main Outcome and MeasureOur main outcome was CFR (deaths per 100 confirmed cases). We examined CFR by age and race-ethnicities.

ResultsWe found substantial variations in disaggregating and reporting case and death data across states. Only three states, California, Illinois and Ohio, had sufficient age- and race-ethnicity-disaggregation to allow the investigation of racial-ethnic disparities in CFR while controlling for age. In total, we analyzed 391,991confirmed cases and 17,612 confirmed deaths. The crude CFRs varied from, e.g. 7.35% among Non-Hispanic (NH) White population to 1.39% among Hispanic population in Ohio. After age standardization, racial-ethnic differences in CFR narrowed, e.g. from 5.28% among NH White population to 3.79% among NH Asian population in Ohio, or an over one-fold difference. In addition, the ranking of race-ethnic-specific CFRs changed after age standardization. NH White population had the leading crude CFRs whereas NH Black and NH Asian population had the leading and second leading age-adjusted CFRs respectively in two of the three states. Hispanic populations age-adjusted CFR were substantially higher than the crude. Sensitivity analysis did not change these results qualitatively.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe availability and quality of age- and race-ethnic-specific COVID-19 case and death data varied greatly across states. Age distributions in confirmed cases obscured racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 CFR. Age standardization narrows racial-ethnic disparities and changes ranking. Public COVID-19 data availability, quality, and harmonization need improvement to address racial disparities in this pandemic.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 case fatality ratios (CFR) across states after adjusting for age?

FindingsWe conducted direct standardization among 391,991 COVID-19 cases and 17,612 deaths from California, Illinois and Ohio to compare age-adjusted CFR across race-ethnicities. The racial-ethnic disparities in CFR narrowed and the ranking changed after age standardization.

432,COVID-19 Classification of X-ray Images Using Deep Neural Networks,"BackgroundIn the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is playing an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19. Machine learning solutions have been shown to be useful for X-ray analysis and classification in a range of medical contexts.

PurposeThe purpose of this study is to create and evaluate a machine learning model for diagnosis of COVID-19, and to provide a tool for searching for similar patients according to their X-ray scans.

Materials and MethodsIn this retrospective study, a classifier was built using a pre-trained deep learning model (ReNet50) and enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation to detect COVID-19 in frontal CXR images collected between January 2018 and July 2020 in four hospitals in Israel. A nearest-neighbors algorithm was implemented based on the network results that identifies the images most similar to a given image. The model was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and of the precision-recall (P-R) curve.

ResultsThe dataset sourced for this study includes 2362 CXRs, balanced for positive and negative COVID-19, from 1384 patients (63 +/- 18 years, 552 men). Our model achieved 89.7% (314/350) accuracy and 87.1% (156/179) sensitivity in classification of COVID-19 on a test dataset comprising 15% (350 of 2326) of the original data, with AUC of ROC 0.95 and AUC of the P-R curve 0.94. For each image we retrieve images with the most similar DNN-based image embeddings; these can be used to compare with previous cases.

ConclusionDeep Neural Networks can be used to reliably classify CXR images as COVID-19 positive or negative. Moreover, the image embeddings learned by the network can be used to retrieve images with similar lung findings.

SummaryDeep Neural Networks and can be used to reliably predict chest X-ray images as positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or as negative for COVID-19.

Key ResultsO_LIA machine learning model was able to detect chest X-ray (CXR) images of patients tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 with accuracy of 89.7%, sensitivity of 87.1% and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95.

433,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 in a German liver transplant recipient cohort: a prospective serosurvey study.,"In liver transplant (LT) recipients with severe COVID-19 fatal outcome has been reported in a substantial subset of patients. Whether LT recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 compared to the general population is controversial. Here we report the first results of a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in a large LT recipient cohort.

Taking into account known risk factors, LT recipients a priori represented a high-risk cohort for severe COVID-19 with 101/219 (46.1 %) presenting with more than 2 risk factors for severe COVID-19. Out of 219 LT recipients 8 (3.7%) were either tested positive for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG. 5/8 (62.5 %) did not show any clinical signs of infection, 3/8 (37.5%) had self-limited disease, none required hospitalization for COVID-19. 5/8 (67.5%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients showed high utilization of the healthcare system. 2/8 (25 %) had known exposure to infected health care personal. A majority of 65.4 % often or always avoided outside family social contacts. Face masks were commonly worn by all patients.

Healthcare system, financial growth, industrial development and educational programme are stunted. Inevitably, professional training and education are affected which include the medical training of medical interns.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis.

ResultsMedical interns feel that they lack clinical skills (p = 0.005) and need more exposure in surgical operations (p =0.029). Some are satisfied with the introduction of triage (p = 0.024), online teaching (p = 0.005) and bedside teaching (p=0.023). Most of them think they are fit and ready to handle the pandemic (p = 0.012 and 0.025 respectively) except first year medical interns (p = 0.029). Some feel like their time are wasted (p <0.05) as they are involved in many non-clinical activities (p = 0.003).

435,"Development, evaluation, and validation of machine learning models for COVID-19 detection based on routine blood tests","BackgroundThe rRT-PCR test, the current gold standard for the detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), presents with known shortcomings, such as long turnaround time, potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates around 15-20%, and expensive equipment. The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative.

MethodsThree different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two sub-datasets (COVID-specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID-19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal-external and external validation.

ResultsWe developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID-specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96.

ConclusionsML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients.

436,GABA administration prevents severe illness and death following coronavirus infection in mice,"There is an urgent need for new treatments to prevent and ameliorate severe illness and death induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 causes pneumonitis in mice which shares many pathological characteristics with human SARS-CoV infection. Previous studies have shown that the amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether oral treatment with GABA could modulate the MHV-1 induced pneumonitis in susceptible A/J mice. As expected, MHV-1-inoculated control mice became severely ill (as measured by weight loss, clinical score, and the ratio of lung weight to body weight) and >60% of them succumbed to the infection. In contrast, mice that received GABA immediately after MHV-1 inoculation became only mildly ill and all of them recovered. When GABA treatment was initiated after the appearance of illness (3 days post-MHV-1 infection), we again observed that GABA treatment significantly reduced the severity of illness and greatly increased the frequency of recovery. Therefore, the engagement of GABA receptors (GABA-Rs) prevented the MHV-1 infection-induced severe pneumonitis and death in mice. Given that GABA-R agonists, like GABA and homotaurine, are safe for human consumption, stable, inexpensive, and available worldwide, they are promising candidates to help prevent severe illness stemming from SARS-CoV-2 infection and other coronavirus strains.",Jide Tian; Blake Milddleton; Daniel L Kaufman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325423,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325423,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,False
437,Efficient culture of SARS-CoV-2 in human hepatoma cells enhances viability of the virus in human lung cancer cell lines permitting the screening of antiviral compounds,"Efforts to mitigate COVID-19 include screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be re-purposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50/mL, and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2 refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. The enhanced ability of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs, including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine, mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.

ImportanceThe cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801, two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral activity are observed depending on the cell line. Thus, it is essential to select the most relevant target cells for pre-clinical screenings of antiviral compounds, facilitated by using a virus with broader tropism.",Santseharay Ramirez; Carlota Fernandez-Antunez; Long Van Pham; Line Abildgaard Ryberg; Shan Feng; Martin Schou Pedersen; Lotte Scheibelein Mikkelsen; Judith M Gottwein; Ulrik Fahnoe; Jens Bukh,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325316,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.325316,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,False
438,Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in Long Term Care Facilities in England: a national survey,"BackgroundOutbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred worldwide in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to infection are poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in LTCFs.

MethodsCross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults >65 years in England with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Exposures included: LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, and use of disease control measures. Main outcomes included risk factors for infection and outbreaks, estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and survey and test-based weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.

Findings5126/9081 (56%) LTCFs participated in the survey, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff. The weighted period prevalence of infection in residents and staff respectively was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.9-11.1%) and 3.8% (95%: 3.4-4.2%) and 2724 LTCFs (53.1%) had [&ge;]1 infection. Odds of infection and/or outbreaks were reduced in LTCFs that paid sickness pay, cohorted staff, did not employ agency staff and had higher staff to resident ratios. Higher odds of infection and outbreaks were identified in facilities with more admissions, lower cleaning frequency, poor compliance with isolation and ""for profit"" status.

InterpretationHalf of LTCFs had no cases suggesting they remain vulnerable to outbreaks. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting. Transmission from residents is associated with the number of admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 outbreaks have occurred worldwide in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), which provide care to elderly and vulnerable residents, and are associated with high mortality. The reasons why LTCFs are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 are poorly understood. Most studies of risk factors for COVID-19 to date have been limited by scale, and poor quality administrative, demographic and infection control data. We conducted a systematic search on 27 July 2020 in MEDLINE Ovid, WHO COVID-19 database and in MedRxiv to identify studies reporting risk factors for COVID-19 infection or outbreaks in LTCFs, with no date or language restrictions. We used the search terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""coronavirus"" and ""care home"", ""nursing home"", ""long term care facilit"" and excluded studies that did not investigate LTCF-level risk factors. 14 studies met our inclusion criteria comprising 11 cross-sectional studies and 3 surveys. The largest cross-sectional study was conducted in 9395 specialised nursing facilities across 30 states in USA; the largest survey was conducted in 124 LTCFs in Haute-Garrone region of France. Risk of bias was high across all studies, and results could not be pooled due to heterogeneity between studies. Main risk factors for infection and/or outbreaks related to the size of the facility, lower ratios of staff to residents, urban location, higher occupancy, and the community prevalence of infection. Only one study collected data on the use of disease control measures during the pandemic, and no studies provided data on risk factors such as the use of temporary staff, or the impact of staff working across multiple locations.

Added value of this studyWe conducted a national telephone survey with managers of all LTCFs in England which provided dementia care or care to residents aged > 65 years to collect data on the number of staff and residents in each facility, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, characteristics of the facility e.g.size, staffing (use of temporary staff, staffing ratios, sickness pay) and disease control measures such as cohorting and isolation. We identified risk factors for infection in residents and staff, outbreaks (defined as [&ge;]1 case per LTCF) and large outbreaks using logistic regression. We also estimated the proportion of staff and residents who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Responses were obtained from 5126 of out 9081 (56%) of eligible LTCFs. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most detailed survey of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks that has been conducted in LTCFs.

Implications of all the available evidenceAlmost half of LTCFs surveyed in this study did not report any cases of infection, and remain vulnerable to infection and outbreaks, highlighting the need for effective control measures.

439,A Mechanism for Severity of Disease in Older Patients with COVID-19: The Nexus between Telomere Length and Lymphopenia,"BackgroundLymphopenia due to a plummeting T-cell count is a major feature of severe COVID-19. T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and TL shortens with age. Older persons are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19, and we hypothesized that those with short TL have less capacity to mount an adequate T-cell proliferative response to SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis predicts that among older patients with COVID-19, shorter telomeres of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be associated with a lower lymphocyte count.

MethodsOur sample comprised 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87 {+/-} 8 (mean {+/-} SD) and 87 {+/-} 9 years, respectively. We measured TL by the Telomere Shortest Length Assay, a novel method that measures and tallies the short telomeres directly relevant to telomere-mediated biological processes. The primary analysis quantified TL as the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases. For comparison, we also quantified TL by Southern blotting, which measures the mean length of telomeres.

ResultsLymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 {+/-} 0.42 in COVID-19 patients and 1.50 {+/-} 0.50 in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with the mean of telomeres measured by TeSLA (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte counts showed no statistically significant correlations with Southern blotting results in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsThese results support the hypothesis that a compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response contributes to lymphopenia and the resulting disproportionate severity of COVID-19 among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.",Athanase Benetos; Tsung-Po Lai; Simon Toupance; Carlos Labat; Simon Verhulst; Christine Perret-Guillaume; Sylvie Gautier; Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer; Daniel Levy; Ezra Susser; Abraham Aviv,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205393,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205393,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
440,"Evaluation of the accuracy, ease of use and limit of detection of novel, rapid, antigen-detecting point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2","BackgroundReliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostics not requiring laboratory infrastructure could be a game changer in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Global South. We assessed performance, limit of detection and ease-of-use of three antigen-detecting, rapid POC tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThis prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study recruited participants suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 in Germany and the UK. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) or NP and/or oropharyngeal swabs (OP) were collected from participants (one for clinical RT-PCR and one for Ag-RDT). Performance of each of three Ag-RDTs was compared to RT-PCR overall, and according to predefined subcategories e.g. cycle threshold (CT)-value, days from symptoms onset, etc. In addition, limited verification of the analytical limit-of-detection (LOD) was determined. To understand the usability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed.

ResultsBetween April 17th and August 25th, 2020, 2417 participants were enrolled, with 70 (3.0%) testing positive by RT-PCR. The best-performing test (SD Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q) was 76x6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 62x8-86x4) sensitive and 99x3% (CI 98x6-99x6) specific. A sub-analysis showed all samples with RT-PCR CT-values <25 were detectable by STANDARD Q. The test was considered easy-to-use (SUS 86/100) and suitable for POC. Bioeasy and Coris showed specificity of 93x1% (CI 91x0%-94x8%) and 95x8% (CI 93x4%-97x4%), respectively, not meeting the predefined target of [&ge;]98%.

441,Genetic and non-genetic factors affecting the expression of COVID-19 relevant genes in the large airway epithelium,"Introductory paragraphParticular host and environmental factors influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19. We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings - a relevant tissue for SARS-CoV-2 infection - obtained from three cohorts of uninfected individuals, and investigated how non-genetic and genetic factors affect the regulation of host genes implicated in COVID-19. We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.",Silva Kasela; Victor E Ortega; Molly Martorella; Suresh Garudadri; Jenna Nguyen; Elizabeth Ampleford; Anu Pasanen; Srilaxmi Nerella; Kristina L Buschur; Igor Z Barjaktarevic; R Graham Barr; Eugene R Bleecker; Russell P Bowler; Alejandro P Comellas; Christopher B Cooper; David J Couper; Gerard J Criner; Jeffrey L Curtis; MeiLan K Han; Nadia N Hansel; Eric A Hoffman; Robert J Kaner; Jerry A Krishnan; Fernando J Martinez; Merry-Lynn N McDonald; Deborah A Meyers; Robert Paine III; Stephen P Peters; Mario Castro; Loren C Denlinger; Serpil C Erzurum; John V Fahy; Elliot Israel; Nizar N Jarjour; Bruce D Levy; Xingnan Li; Wendy C Moore; Sally E Wenzel; Joe Zein; - NHLBI SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS); - NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Consortium; Charles Langelier; Prescott G Woodruff; Tuuli Lappalainen; Stephanie A Christenson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20202820,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20202820,2020-10-04,2020-10-04,,True
442,Prognostic accuracy of MALDI mass spectrometric analysis of plasma in COVID-19,"PurposeSARS-CoV-2 infection poses a global public health problem. There is a critical need for improvements in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis combined with bottom-up proteomic analysis of plasma proteins might identify features to predict high and low risk cases of COVID-19.

Patients and MethodsWe used MALDI-TOF MS to analyze plasma small proteins and peptides isolated using C18 micro-columns from a cohort containing a total of 117 cases of high (hospitalized) and low risk (outpatients) cases split into training (n = 88) and validation sets (n= 29). The plasma protein/peptide fingerprint obtained was used to train the algorithm before validation using a blinded test cohort.

ResultsSeveral sample preparation, MS and data analysis parameters were optimized to achieve an overall accuracy of 85%, sensitivity of 90%, and specificity of 81% in the training set. In the blinded test set, this signature reached an overall accuracy of 93.1%, sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 100%. From this signature, we identified two distinct regions in the MALDI-TOF profile belonging to the same proteoforms. A combination of 1D SDS-PAGE and quantitative bottom-up proteomic analysis allowed the identification of intact and truncated forms of serum amyloid A-1 and A-2 proteins. Conclusions: We found a plasma proteomic profile that discriminates against patients with high and low risk COVID-19. Proteomic analysis of C18-fractionated plasma may have a role in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. Further validation will consolidate its clinical utility.

443,Corticosteroid pulses for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Effects on mortality and in-hospital stay.,"Background: COVID-19 has high mortality in hospitalized patients, and we need effective treatments. Our objective was to assess corticosteroid pulses influence on 60-days mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, intensive care admission, and hospital stay. Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y Leon, Spain (865.096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2 < 300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or died the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Findings: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. One hundred and twenty-four patients were on corticosteroid pulses, and 133 were not. 30{middle dot}3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulses group and 42{middle dot}9% (57/133) in the non-exposed cohort. These differences (12{middle dot}6% CI95% [8{middle dot}54-16{middle dot}65]) were statically significant (log-rank 4{middle dot}72, p=0{middle dot}03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5{middle dot}31, p=0{middle dot}021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0{middle dot}561, p= 0{middle dot}039). There were no significant differences in intensive care admission rate (p=0{middle dot}173). The hospital stay was longer in the corticosteroid group (p<0,001). Interpretation: This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality.

444,Performance of a rapid SARS-COV-2 serology test in whole blood and separated plasma,"Rapid SARS-COV-2 related serology testing can help identify and manage the spread of infection in decentralized testing environments but the limitation in performance of existing tests in blood has restricted implementation of testing at the point-of-care. Optimization of existing rapid tests in whole blood will require significant effort in the short-term and there is a need for solutions to help bridge the gap in performance between plasma and whole blood. We demonstrate here the implementation of the H.E.R.M.E.S platform, a portable plasma separation system that can enhance the performance of blood-based diagnostic testing, with a commercially available SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM serology rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in a blinded study with 61 human samples. We compare the performance of the RDT in whole blood and separated plasma and highlight that plasma yields a 39% increase in positivity agreement with PCR in samples collected from patients with early infections. We further legitimize the increase in positivity agreement rate with the help of an independent evaluation by 10 previously untrained users. The H.E.R.M.E.S plasma separation system circumvents the need for assay optimization in whole blood and furthers the legitimacy of incorporating SARS-COV-2 serology RDTs at the point-of-care.

MethodsLothian Birth Cohort 1936 members, mean age 84 years (SD=0.3), responded to an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n=190). We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes.

ResultsFour respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity. In multivariable regression models, adherence to guidance by leaving the house less often associated with less professional occupational class (OR=0.71, 95%CI 0.51- 0.98) and poorer self-rated general health (OR=0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92). Increased internet use associated with female sex (OR=2.32, 95%CI 1.12-4.86) and higher general cognitive ability (OR=1.53, 95%CI 1.03-2.33). Loneliness associated with living alone (OR=0.15, 95%CI 0.07-0.31) and greater anxiety symptoms (OR=1.76, 95%CI 0.45-1.24). COVID-19 related stress associated with lower emotional stability scores (OR=0.40, 95%CI 0.24-0.62).

446,An Integrated Framework with Machine Learning and Radiomics for Accurate and Rapid Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray,"Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is considered the first key action to prevent spread of the virus. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as a gold standard point-of-care diagnostic tool. However, several limitations of RT-PCR have been identified, e.g., low sensitivity, cost, long delay in getting results and the need of a professional technician to collect samples. On the other hand, chest X-ray (CXR) is routinely used as a cost-effective diagnostic test for diagnosis and monitoring different respiratory abnormalities and is currently being used as a discriminating tool for COVID-19. However, visual assessment of CXR is not able to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to detect COVID-19 directly from CXR images with reasonably good accuracy on a data set that was randomly split into two subsets for training and test. Since these methods require a huge number of images for training, data augmentation with geometric transformation was applied to increase the number of images. It is highly likely that the images of the same patients are present in both the training and test sets resulting in higher accuracies in detection of COVID-19. It is, therefore, vital to assess the performance of COVID-19 detection algorithm on an independent data set with different degrees of the disease before being employed for clinical settings. On the other hand, machine learning techniques that depend on handcrafted features extraction and selection approaches can be trained with smaller data set. The features can also be analyzed separately for various lung conditions. Radiomics features are such kind of handcrafted features that represent heterogeneous appearance of the lung on CXR quantitatively and can be used to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Based on this hypothesis, a machine learning based technique is proposed here that is trained on a set of suitable radiomics features (71 features) to detect COVID-19. It is found that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ensemble Bagging Model Trees (EBM) trained on these 71 radiomics features can distinguish between COVID-19 and other diseases with an overall sensitivity of 99.6% and 87.8% and specificity of 85% and 97% respectively. Though the performance is comparable for both methods, EBM is more robust across severity levels. Severity, in this case, was scored between 0 to 4 by two experienced radiologists for each lung segment of each CXR image represents the degree of severity of the disease. For the case of 0 severity, sensitivity and specificity of the EBM method are 91.7% and 100% respectively indicating that there are certain radiomics pattern that are not visibly distinguishable. Since the proposed method does not require any manual intervention (e.g., sample collection etc.), it can be integrated with any standard X-ray reporting system to be used as an efficient, cost-effective and rapid early diagnosis device. It can also be deployed in places where quick results of the COVID-19 test are required, e.g., airports, seaports, hospitals, health clinics, etc.",Mahbubunnabi Tamal; Maha Alshammari; Meernah Alabdullah; Rana Hourani; Hossain Abu Alola; Tarek M.

447,"Exhaled aerosol increases with COVID-19 infection, and risk factors of disease symptom severity","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) transmits by droplets generated from surfaces of airway mucus during processes of respiration within hosts infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. We studied respiratory droplet generation and exhalation in human and nonhuman primate subjects with and without COVID-19 infection to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other changes in physiological state, translates into observable evolution of numbers and sizes of exhaled respiratory droplets in healthy and diseased subjects. In our observational cohort study of the exhaled breath particles of 74 healthy human subjects, and in our experimental infection study of eight nonhuman primates infected by aerosol with SARS-CoV-2, we found that exhaled aerosol particles increase one to three orders of magnitude with aging, high BMI, and COVID-19 infection. These variances appear to be related to changes in airway mucus surface composition and the propensity for mucus surfaces to breakup into small droplets during acts of breathing. We also observed that 20% of those participating in our human study accounted for 80% of the overall exhaled bioaerosol, reflecting a bioaerosol distribution analogous to a classical 20:80 super spreader distribution.",David A Edwards; Dennis Ausiello; Robert Langer; Jonathan Salzman; Tom Devlin; Brandon J.

448,COVID-19 Pandemic in University Hospital: Is There an Effect on The Medical Interns?,"IntroductionCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the current healthcare system and carries a major impact to the healthcare workers (HCW). University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) has been selected as one of the centres in managing COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. Many HCW including the medical interns, are directly or indirectly involved in the management.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on UMMC medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis.

ResultsOur study shows that medical interns are tired (p = 0.014), starving (p = 0.004), have inadequate exercises (p = 0.004) and burdened with heavy workload (p=0.023) during pandemic period. Many are depressed (p = 0.043), scared to work (p = 0.03), and worried of getting infected (p < 0.05). Some quarrel with their colleagues (p < 0.05), losing contact with friends (p = 0.022) and feel that it will be beneficial to have a peer support group (p = 0.027).

450,Cardiovascular risk factors are independently associated with COVID-19 mortality: a prospective cohort study,"ObjectivesRecent reports suggest a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in COVID-19 patients, but the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in the clinical course of COVID-19 is unknown. We evaluated the time-to-event relationship between hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and COVID-19 outcomes.

DesignWe analyzed data from the prospective Dutch COVID-PREDICT cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection.

SettingPatients from 8 participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the COVID-PREDICT cohort were included.

ParticipantsAdmitted, adult patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or high suspicion based on CT-imaging of the thorax. Patients were followed for major outcomes during hospitalization. CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics.

Primary and secondary outcomes measuresThe primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of ICU-admission and ICU-mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors.

ResultsWe included 1604 patients with a mean age of 66{+/-}15 of whom 60.5% were men. Antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics were used by 45%, 34.7%, and 22.1% of patients. After adjustment for age and sex, the presence of [&ge;]2 risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk (HR 1.52, 95%CI 1.15-2.02), but not with ICU-admission. Moreover, the use of [&ge;]2 antidiabetics and [&ge;]2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of respectively 2.09 (95%CI 1.55-2.80) and 1.46 (95%CI 1.11-1.91).

ConclusionsThe accumulation of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes leads to a stepwise increased risk for short-term mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients independent of age and sex. Further studies investigating how these risk factors disproportionately affect COVID-19 patients are warranted.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWhile previous data reported a high prevalence of CVD risk factors in COVID-19 patients, this study investigated whether diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension predict adverse outcomes.
C_LIO_LIThis study is limited by the use of medication as surrogate for cardiovascular risk factors

451,Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 Antibodies in Scottish Healthcare Workers,"IntroductionHealthcare workers are believed to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied.

MethodsA prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace information. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison.

ResultsA total of 2062 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.2% were white. 299 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.1% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 11.8% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies.

ConclusionIn this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population.

452,Circulating levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are lower in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundTo better understand the biology of COVID-19, we have explored the behavior of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), an angiogenic, vasodilating, and immune modulating peptide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.

MethodsLevels of CGRP in the serum of 57 COVID-19 patients (24 asymptomatic, 23 hospitalized in the general ward, and 10 admitted to the intensive care unit) and healthy donors (n=24) were measured by ELISA. In addition, to better understand the physiological consequences of the observed variations, we investigated by immunofluorescence the distribution of RAMP1, one of the components of the CGRP receptor, in autopsy lung specimens.

ResultsCGRP levels greatly decreased in COVID-19 patients (p<0.001) when compared to controls, and there were no significant differences due to disease severity, sex, age, or comorbidities. We found that COVID-19 patients treated with proton pump inhibitors had lower levels of CGRP than other patients not taking this treatment (p=0.001). RAMP1 immunoreactivity was found in smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels and the bronchial tree, and in the airways epithelium. In COVID-19 samples, RAMP1 was also found in proliferating type II pneumocytes, a common finding in these patients.

ConclusionsThe lower levels of CGRP should negatively impact the respiratory physiology of COVID-19 patients due to vasoconstriction, improper angiogenesis, less epithelial repair, and faulty immune response. Therefore, restoring CGRP levels in these patients may represent a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19.",Laura Ochoa-Callejero; Josune Garcia-Sanmartin; Pablo Villoslada-Blanco; Maria Iniguez; Patricia Perez-Matute; Rachel Brody; Jose A.

453,"Interactions between seasonal human coronaviruses and implications for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A retrospective study in Stockholm, Sweden, 2009-2020","ObjectivesThe four seasonal coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are frequent causes of respiratory infections and show annual and seasonal variation. Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsResults from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020.

ResultsSeasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2,130 samples (3.9%). OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4% of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0%), HKU1 (17.6%), and 229E (15.3%). The overall fraction of positive samples was relatively similar between seasons. In contrast, at species level there was distinct pattern of biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. The species showed different age distributions, with OC43 and 229E positivity being relatively constant across age strata, while the incidence of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age.

ConclusionsBoth the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction.

454,High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity in England during September 2020: interim report of round 5 of REACT-1 study,"BackgroundREACT-1 is a community survey of PCR confirmed swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 among random samples of the population in England. This interim report includes data from the fifth round of data collection currently underway for swabs sampled from the 18th to 26th September 2020.

MethodsRepeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 160,000 people in each round of data collection. Collection of self-administered nose and throat swab for PCR and questionnaire data. Prevalence of swab-positivity by round and by demographic variables including age, sex, region, ethnicity. Estimation of reproduction number (R) between and within rounds, and time trends using exponential growth or decay model. Assessment of geographical clustering based on boundary-free spatial model.

ResultsOver the 9 days for which data are available, we find 363 positives from 84,610 samples giving a weighted prevalence to date of 0.55% (0.47%, 0.64%) in round 5. This implies that 411,000 (351,000, 478,000) people in England are virus-positive under the assumption that the swab assay is 75% sensitive. Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased [~]7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased [~]5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were [~]2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants.

ConclusionRapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks.

455,"COVID-19 era, Preventive effect of no going out against co-infection of the seasonal influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2","In the situation where expansion of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) does not stop, there is concern about co-infection of people with the seasonal influenza infections from late autumn to winter 2020. Therefore, the importance of supplying vaccines against the seasonal influenza has been pointed out all over the world. As an example in Japan, the number of people infected with the seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which are the seasonal infectious diseases in the 2020 season, has decreased remarkably compared to the number of people infected each year. It is believed that the significant reduction in the number of people infected with these seasonal infectious diseases is a result of the pervasive hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in COVID-19 rea. To examine the correlation between the three factors of the number of people with each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate, we created a three-dimensional scatter plot based on these three factors using principal component analysis.

456,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Brazil using digital technology,"BackgroundBrazil has the third-highest number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology.

MethodsWe used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases.

ResultsAfter calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19 occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated/reported ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19 cases (66 vs 38 cases/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively, p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing.

Given prior research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.

459,Theta autoregressive neural network model for COVID-19 outbreak predictions,"An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the form of peculiar pneumonia has spread globally since its first case at Wuhan, China, in December 2019, increasing infected cases and mortality at a pandemic speed. Thus, forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic became a key research interest for both the epidemiologists and statisticians. These future predictions are useful for the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public-health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop the most suitable forecasting model that can generate real-time short-term (ten days) and long-term (fifty days) out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for eight profoundly affected countries, namely the United States of America, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, and Iran. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta model and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is proposed. The proposed method outperforms previously available single and hybrid forecasting models for COVID-19 predictions in most data sets. In addition, the ergodicity and asymptotic stationarity of the proposed TARNN model are established which is of particular interest in nonlinear time series literature.

460,The SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction rate has a high correlation with a contact index derived from large-scale individual location data using GPS-enabled mobile phones in Germany,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was first discovered in Hubei, China in December 2019, has caused an ongoing pandemic. Due to pauci-symptomatic cases, the virus may spread invisibly in a community. In the absence of vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like interpersonal distancing were implemented in several countries and have been key to effectively reduce viral spreading. In Germany after an exponential growth of case numbers in March 2020, NPIs were able to effectively control the pandemic and sufficiently reduced the daily reported new infections allowing for partial release of NPIs. We developed a novel statistical method to evaluate contacts between individuals, which is essential for virus transmission. We derived the contact index, an index for the intensity and heterogeneity of contact behavior from spatial proximity between individuals as proxy for physical interaction based on complex network science. We estimated the contact index from large-scale GPS mobile phone data of 1.15 to 1.4 million users in Germany per day (March to July 2020). A high correlation between the contact index and the effective reproduction number six days later could be observed (Pearson correlation r = 0.96, P-value < 0.001 for all reported Pearson correlations). This correlation was observed in three different phases of the virus spread in Germany 1) the early phase of the first wave with the highest reproduction rate, 2) phase of strict NPIs (lockdown) with the lowest reproduction, 3) release of NPIs accompanied with an increase of reproduction.

461,"Quantifying the dynamics of COVID-19 burden and impact of interventions in Java, Indonesia","Measuring COVID-19 spread remains challenging in many countries due to testing limitations. In Java, reported cases and deaths increased throughout 2020 despite intensive control measures, particularly within Jakarta and during Ramadan. However, underlying trends are likely obscured by variations in case ascertainment. COVID-19 protocol funerals in Jakarta provide alternative data indicating a substantially higher burden than observed within confirmed deaths. Transmission estimates using this metric follow mobility trends, suggesting earlier and more sustained intervention impact than observed in routine data. Modelling suggests interventions have lessened spread to rural, older communities with weaker healthcare systems, though predict healthcare capacity will soon be exceeded in much of Java without further control.

462,Tracing and testing the COVID-19 contact chain: cost-benefit tradeoffs,"Traditional contact tracing for COVID-19 tests the direct contacts of those who test positive even if the contacts do not show any symptom. But, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? The question arises because by the time an infected individual is tested the infection starting from him may have infected a chain of individuals. One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of testing the contact chain of an individual who tests positive and discover that it can both substantially reduce the cumulative infection count over time and reduce the testing load over time. We also discover a phenomenon of diminishing return beyond a threshold value on the depth of the chain to be tested in one go, the threshold then provides the most desirable tradeoff between benefit in terms of reducing the cumulative infection count and cost in terms of increasing the testing load.",Jungyeol Kim; Xingran Chen; Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti; Saswati Sarkar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205047,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205047,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
463,A One-Minute Blood Test to Monitor Immune Responses in COVID-19 Patients and Predict Clinical Risks of Developing Moderate to Severe Symptoms,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought enormous loss and interruption to human life and the global economy since the first outbreak reported in China between late 2019 to early 2020, and will likely remain a public health threat in the months and years to come. Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, most people will develop no or mild symptoms, however, a small percentage of the population will become severely ill, require hospitalization, intensive care, and some succumb to death. The current knowledge of COVID-19 disease progression with worsening symptom complex implicates the critical importance of identifying patients with high clinical risk compared to those who would be at lower risk for disease control and patient management with better therapeutic output. Currently no clinical test is available that can predict risk factors and immune status change at different severity scales. The immune system plays a critical role in the defense against infectious diseases. Extensive research has found that COVID-19 patients with poor clinical outcomes differ significantly in their immune responses to the virus from those who exhibit milder symptoms. We previously developed a nanoparticle-enabled blood test that can detect the humoral immune status change in animals. In this study, we applied this new test to analyze the immune response in relation to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. From the testing of 153 COVID-19 patient samples and 142 negative controls, we detected statistically significant differences between COVID-19 patients with no or mild symptoms from those who developed moderate to severe symptoms. Mechanistic study suggests that these differences are associated with type 1 versus type 2 immune responses. We conclude that this new rapid test could potentially become a valuable clinical tool for COVID-19 patient risk stratification and management.",Chirajyoti Deb; Allan N Salinas; Aurea Middleton; Katelyn Kern; Daleen Penoyer; Rahul Borsadia; Charles Hunley; Vijay Mehta; Laura Irastorza; Devendra I Mehta; Tianyu Zheng; QUN HUO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203844,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203844,2020-10-02,2020-10-02,,True
464,A Multiscale Coarse-grained Model of the SARS-CoV-2 Virion,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations, however, are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and on-going development of a largely ""bottom-up"" coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Structural data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data becomes publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

Identification of viral peptides presented on class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) can reveal epitopes for recognition by cytotoxic T cells and potential incorporation into vaccines. Here, we report the first HLA-I immunopeptidome of SARS-CoV-2 in two human cell lines at different times post-infection using mass spectrometry. We found HLA-I peptides derived not only from canonical ORFs, but also from internal out-of-frame ORFs in Spike and Nucleoprotein not captured by current vaccines. Proteomics analyses of infected cells revealed that SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with antigen processing and immune signaling pathways. Based on the endogenously processed and presented viral peptides that we identified, we estimate that a pool of 24 peptides would provide one or more peptides for presentation by at least one HLA allele in 99% of the human population.

466,Safe and effective two-in-one replicon-and-VLP minispike vaccine for COVID-19,"The large SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates but can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, which may cause vaccination-induced complications or enhancement of COVID-19 disease. Besides, encoding of a functional S in replication-competent virus vector vaccines may result in the emergence of viruses with altered or expanded tropism. Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine, VSV{Delta}G-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients. Boost immunization with the identical replicon further enhanced neutralizing activity. These results demonstrate that rhabdovirus minispike replicons represent effective and safe alternatives to vaccination approaches using replication-competent viruses and/or the entire S antigen.

An extensive investigation of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for disease control. Various recombinant monoclonal antibodies of human origin that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been isolated from convalescent patients and will be applied as therapies and prophylaxis. However, the need for dedicated monoclonal antibodies in molecular pathology research is not fully addressed.

468,Transmission of SARS-COV-2 from China to Europe and West Africa: a detailed phylogenetic analysis.,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019 in China and raised fears that it could overwhelm healthcare systems worldwide. In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.

The virus is mutating steadily and this is monitored by a well curated database of viral nucleotide sequences from samples taken from infected individual thus enabling phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic associations.

MethodsWe downloaded from the GISAID database, SARS-CoV-2 sequences established from four West African countries Ghana, Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria and then performed phylogenetic analysis employing the nextstrain pipeline. Based on mutations found within the sequences we calculated and visualized statistics characterizing clades according to the GISAID nomenclature.

ResultsWe found country-specific patterns of viral clades: the later Europe-associated G-clades predominantly in Senegal and Gambia, and combinations of the earlier (L, S, V) and later clades in Ghana and Nigeria. Contrary to our expectations, the later Europe-associated G-clades emerged before the earlier clades. Detailed analysis of distinct samples showed that some of the earlier clades might have circulated latently and some reflect migration routes via Mali and Tunisia.

ConclusionsThe distinct patterns of viral clades in the West African countries point at its emergence from Europe and China via Asia and Europe. The observation that the later clades emerged before the earlier clades could be simply due to founder effects or due to latent circulation of the earlier clades. Only a marginal correlation of the G-clades associated with the D614G mutation could be identified with the relatively low case fatality (0.6-3.2).

Due to the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells and its pathogenesis remain largely unclear, there are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Besides severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities may also increase risk of fatal disease outcome. Therefore, it is required to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on pre-existing diseases of patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. In the current study, we have reported that SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins and some anti-COVID-19 drugs currently used are able to induce lytic reactivation of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), one of major human oncogenic viruses through manipulation of intracellular signaling pathways.

470,SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with aggressive haematological malignancies,"The development of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of seroprevalence and may afford protection from infection. It has been presumed that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be impaired in patients with aggressive haematological malignancy (PHM) due to underlying immunological dysfunction caused by malignancy or systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT), placing them at increased risk. Here we analysed longitudinal serum samples from ten hospitalised PHM with aggressive disease and on SACT, collected up to 103 days post-onset of COVID-19 symptoms. We found that the majority (8/9) of PHM with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted and developed antibodies to the major SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1 and N) with most (6/8) produced neutralising antibody responses. Furthermore, the dynamics of antibody responses were broadly similar to that reported for the general population, except for a possible delay to seroconversion.

471,SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a UK population: detectable IgG for up to 20 weeks post infection.,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitated rapid and global responses across all areas of healthcare, including an unprecedented interest in serological immunoassays to detect antibodies to the virus. The dynamics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still not well understood.

MethodsWe measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma samples from 880 people in Northern Ireland by Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA/IgM, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and EuroImmun IgG SARS-CoV-2 ELISA immunoassays to analyse immune dynamics over time. Using these results, we develop a  pseudo gold standard reference cohort against which to assess immunoassay performance. We report performance metrics for the UK-RTC AbC-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) against a characterised panel of 304 positives established using the  pseudo gold standard system and 350 negative samples.

ResultsWe detect persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG up to 140 days (20 weeks) post infection, across all three antibody immunoassays, at levels up to 4.4 times the cut-off for a positive result by Roche measurement. Using our  pseudo gold standard cohort (n=348 positive, n=510 negative) we determine the sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial immunoassays used (EuroImmun; Sens. 98.9% [97.7-99.7%]; Spec. 99.2% [98.4-99.8%]; Roche; Sens. 99.4% [98.6-100%]; Spec.

The UK-RTC AbC-19 lateral flow immunoassay using shows a sensitivity of 97.70% (95.72%-99.34%) and specificity of 100% (100.00-100.00%).

ConclusionsThrough comprehensive analysis of a large cohort of pre-pandemic and pandemic individuals, we show detectable levels of IgG antibodies, lasting up to 140 days, providing insight to immunity levels at later time points.

Herein, we report that high-throughput microfluidic screening of antigen-specific B-cells led to the identification of LY-CoV555, a potent anti-spike neutralizing antibody from a convalescent COVID-19 patient. Biochemical, structural, and functional characterization revealed high-affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain, ACE2 binding inhibition, and potent neutralizing activity. In a rhesus macaque challenge model, prophylaxis doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg reduced viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract.

Currently there are no effective antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory therapies. Here we demonstrate that 2019 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (CoV2-S1) induces high levels of NF-{kappa}B activations, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mild epithelial damage, in human bronchial epithelial cells. CoV2-S1-induced NF-{kappa}B activation requires S1 interaction with human ACE2 receptor and early activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and associated unfolded protein response (UPR), and MAP kinase signalling pathways. We developed an antagonistic peptide that inhibits S1-ACE2 interaction and CoV2-S1-induced productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The existing FDA-approved ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylburic acid (4-PBA), and MAP kinase inhibitors, trametinib and ulixertinib, ameliorated CoV2-S1-induced inflammation and epithelial damage.

474,SARS-CoV-2 viral budding and entry can be modeled using virus-like particles,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and expeditiously spread across the globe causing a global pandemic. While a select agent designation has not been made for SARS-CoV-2, closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses are classified as Risk Group 3 select agents, which restricts use of the live viruses to BSL-3 facilities.

475,Thiopurines activate an antiviral unfolded protein response that blocks viral glycoprotein accumulation in cell culture infection model,"Enveloped viruses, including influenza A viruses (IAVs) and coronaviruses (CoVs), utilize the host cell secretory pathway to synthesize viral glycoproteins and direct them to sites of assembly. Using an image-based high-content screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Selective disruption of IAV glycoprotein processing and accumulation by 6-TG and 6-TGo correlated with unfolded protein response (UPR) activation and HA accumulation could be partially restored by the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA). Chemical inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) restored accumulation of NA monomers in the presence of 6-TG or 6-TGo, but did not restore NA glycosylation or oligomerization. Thiopurines inhibited replication of the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), which also correlated with UPR/ISR activation and diminished accumulation of ORF1ab and nucleocapsid (N) mRNAs and N protein, which suggests broader disruption of coronavirus gene expression in ER-derived cytoplasmic compartments. The chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) had little effect on the UPR and did not affect IAV or HCoV-OC43 replication. Consistent with reports on other CoV Spike (S) proteins, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused UPR activation. 6-TG treatment inhibited accumulation of full length S0 or furin-cleaved S2 fusion proteins, but spared the S1 ectodomain. DBeQ, which inhibits the p97 AAA-ATPase required for retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins during ER-associated degradation (ERAD) restored accumulation of S0 and S2 proteins in the presence of 6-TG, suggesting that 6-TG induced UPR accelerates ERAD-mediated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 glycoproteins. Taken together, these data indicate that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective host-targeted antivirals that trigger the UPR and disrupt accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of these thiopurines in limiting IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in cell culture models.

IMPORTANCESecreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are folded and modified prior to transport. During infection, many viruses burden the ER with the task of creating and processing viral glycoproteins that will ultimately be incorporated into viral envelopes. Some viruses refashion the ER into replication compartments where viral gene expression and genome replication take place. This viral burden on the ER can trigger the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to increase the protein folding and processing capacity of the ER to match the protein load. Much remains to be learned about how viruses co-opt the UPR to ensure efficient synthesis of viral glycoproteins. Here, we show that two FDA-approved thiopurine drugs, 6-TG and 6-TGo, induce the UPR in a manner that impedes viral glycoprotein accumulation for enveloped influenza viruses and coronaviruses. These drugs may impede the replication of viruses that require precise tuning of the UPR to support viral glycoprotein synthesis for the successful completion of a replication cycle.",Patrick D Slaine; Mariel Kleer; Brett Duguay; Eric Stanley Pringle; Eileigh Kadijk; Shan Ying; Aruna D Balgi; Michel Roberge; Craig McCormick; Denys A Khaperskyy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.319863,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.319863,2020-10-01,2020-10-01,,False
476,Transcriptional differences for COVID-19 Disease Map genes between males and females indicate a different basal immunophenotype relevant to the disease,"Worldwide COVID-19 epidemiology data indicate clear differences in disease incidence among sex and age groups. Specifically, male patients are at a higher death risk than females. However, whether this difference is the consequence of a pre-existing sex-bias in immune genes or a differential response to the virus has not been studied yet. We created DeCovid, an R shiny app that combines gene expression data of different human tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and the COVID-19 Disease Map gene collection to explore basal gene expression differences across healthy demographic groups. We used this app to study differential gene expression between men and women for COVID-19 associated genes. We identified that healthy women present higher levels in the expression of interferon genes and the JAK-STAT pathway leading to cell survival.",Tianyuan Liu; Leandro Balzano-Nogueira; Ana Lleo; Ana Conesa,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.321059,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.321059,2020-10-01,2020-10-01,,False
477,A small interfering RNA (siRNA) database for SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly transformed into a global pandemic, for which a demand for developing antivirals capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and blocking the activity of its genes has emerged. In this work, we propose a database of SARS-CoV-2 targets for siRNA approaches, aiming to speed the design process by providing a broad set of possible targets and siRNA sequences. Beyond target sequences, it also displays more than 170 features, including thermodynamic information, base context, target genes and alignment information of sequences against the human genome, and diverse SARS-CoV-2 strains, to assess whether siRNAs targets bind or not off-target sequences. This dataset is available as a set of four tables in a single spreadsheet file, each table corresponding to sequences of 18, 19, 20, and 21 nucleotides length, respectively, aiming to meet the diversity of technology and expertise among labs around the world concerning siRNAs design of varied sizes, more specifically between 18 and 21nt length. We hope that this database helps to speed the development of new target antivirals for SARS-CoV-2, contributing to more rapid and effective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Inácio Gomes Medeiros; André Salim Khayat; Beatriz Stransky; Sidney Emanuel Batista dos Santos; Paulo Pimentel Assumpção; Jorge Estefano Santana de Souza,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.321596,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.321596,2020-10-01,2020-10-01,,False
478,Efficacy of Famotidine for COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues unabated in many parts of the world. In the absence of any definite antiviral therapy except some benefit of remdesivir, there is an ongoing search for effective therapy. Famotidine has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients in a few studies. We conducted a systematic review on the use of famotidine in COVID-19. Methods: We searched the databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full text screening and data abstraction were carried out in by two reviewers. Case series, cohort studies and randomized trials were included. Results: Five studies were eligible for inclusion: all were retrospective cohort or case series. Low quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit for the use of famotidine in decreasing mortality in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of two cohort studies showed a statistically significant decrease in the composite outcome for death and intubation with famotidine (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.73).

479,Mental health of undocumented college students during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a surge in mental health problems across the United States, and some reports suggest a more severe impact for racial and ethnic minorities. The present study was conducted to gain a preliminary understanding of the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic specifically for dreamers, i.e., undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as minors. A population of about 150 dreamers currently enrolled at a public university in Delaware were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey contained questions about demographics, mental health, academics, immigration, COVID-19 infection, and unemployment, in addition to mental health screens for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and stress (PSS-10). In total, 109 dreamers completed the survey. We observed remarkably high clinical levels of anxiety and depression: 47% of the dreamers met the clinical cutoff for anxiety, 63% met the cutoff for depression, and 67% (2 in 3) met the cutoff for anxiety and/or depression. Rates of anxiety and depression in our sample were significantly higher than those recently reported for college students overall, suggesting that dreamers may be experiencing a more severe mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that pandemic-induced concerns about finances, COVID-19 infection, immigration, and unemployment (among other factors) were associated with greater anxiety, stress, and depression among the dreamers in our sample. The present findings are consistent with recent predictions by social scientists that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a disproportionately negative impact on the mental health of undocumented immigrants.",Jarid Goodman; Sharron Xuanren Wang; Rubi A Guadarrama Ornelas; Marina Hernandez Santana,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203489,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20203489,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
480,COVID-19 Related Deaths Among Doctors In India,"Background: India has the most number of COVID-19 cases currently in the world, second only to the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused high mortality not only in patients but also health care providers. In this paper, our aim is to analyze the cases of deaths among Indian doctors due to COVID-19 infection. Methods: The details of data were taken from the list of the deceased doctors in India due to COVID-19 infection, which was compiled by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the top body of Indian doctors practicing modern allopathic medicine. The key data fields of age, specialty, and geographical location of the deceased doctors were extracted from the given list, and analysis was performed. Results: A total of 382 COVID-related deaths and 2174 infections were reported amongst doctors in India till 10 September 2020, with a case fatality rate of 16.7% among Indian doctors, which was ten times the CFR of 1.7% in the general population. Among the practicing doctors, after excluding the resident doctors and house surgeons, the CFR was 36.4%, which is almost 22 times more than what was seen in Indian general population. The average age of COVID-related deaths in Indian doctors was 60.8 years, with a median age of 60; 62% of deaths among doctors were in the above 60 years, age group. The maximum number of deceased doctors were amongst general practitioners 225(58.9%). Among the specialists, most deaths were seen in paediatricians 26(6.8%), medical specialists 24(6.3%), general surgeons 22(5.8%), obstetricians & gynecologists 16(4.2%), and anesthesiologists 14(3.7%). The highest COVID-19 related deaths in doctors were seen in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra in that order. Conclusions: The mortality rate is very high among doctors in India compared to the general population. The average age of COVID-19 related death was 60 years among doctors. General practitioners and 60 years+ doctors are at a much higher risk of mortality among the doctors. The states with the high number of COVID-19 cases in India, also had a higher number of doctor deaths.",Aanandita Kapoor; Krishan Mohan Kapoor,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202796,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202796,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
481,Combination therapy with tocilizumab and corticosteroids for aged patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective study.,"Background: The role of combination immunomodulatory therapy with systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab (TCZ) for aged patients with COVID19 associated cytokine release syndrome remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single center study including consecutive patients older than 65 years that developed severe COVID19 between March 3 and May 1, 2020 and were treated with corticosteroids at various doses (methylprednisolone [0.5 mg/Kg/12 hours to 250 mg/24 hours]), either alone (CS group) or associated to intravenous tocilizumab (400 to 600 mg, one to three doses) (CS/TCZ group). Primary outcome was all cause mortality by day +14, whereas secondary outcomes included mortality by day +28 and clinical improvement (discharge and/or a 2 point decrease on a six point ordinal scale) by day +14. Propensity score (PS)based adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were applied. Results: Overall, 181 and 80 patients were included in the CS and CS TCZ groups. All cause 14 day mortality was lower in the CS/TCZ group, both in the PS adjusted (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17 to 0.68; P value = 0.002) and IPTW weighted models (odds ratio [OR]: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.68; P value = 0.001). This protective effect was also observed for 28 day mortality (PS adjusted HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.72; P value = 0.003). Clinical improvement by day +14 was higher in the CS/TCZ group in the IPTW analysis only (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.49 to 3.41; P value <0.001). The occurrence of secondary infection was similar between both groups.

482,LUNG ULTRASOUND FINDINGS IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IN AN URBAN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN THE UK,"COVID-19 can present with respiratory symptoms ranging from mild cough to viral pneumonia and ARDS. Lung ultrasonography has emerged as a promising imaging modality during the pandemic, but there is still a paucity of systematic analysis of lung ultrasound findings. In this retrospective observational study, 12 Zone ultrasound scans of COVID-19 positive patients were systematically analysed for pleural irregularities, subpleural consolidations, B lines, deep consolidations and effusions. Lung abnormalities were analysed according to overall frequency, frequency distribution in coronal and sagittal lung planes and were also correlated to clinical severity groups as determined by oxygenation deficit. Our results show that lung zones with abnormalities can occur juxtaposed to normal lung. Irregular pleural and small subpleural consolidations appear ubiquitously distributed throughout both lungs and occur early in the disease process. Wide B-lines are a predominant feature in COVID-19 infection. B-lines are found in a variety of patterns with number and width correlated to disease severity. In our analysis we also describe a previously unrecognised finding of small peri-pleural effusions in 8.7% of scans occurring in all areas of the lung. The current results form the basis for a more thorough understanding of the lung changes occurring in COVID-19 and the incorporation of lung ultrasound in the setting of COVID-19 infection including triage, diagnosis, treatment approach and prognosis.",Julia Burkert; Hannah Dunlop; Rachel Stewart; Adam Treacy; Robert Jarman; Paramjeet Deol,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20182626,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20182626,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
483,Potential spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity - a mathematical modeling study,"COVID-19 is caused by a hitherto nonexistent pathogen, hence the immune response to the disease is currently unknown. Studies conducted over the past few weeks have found that the antibody titre levels in the blood plasma of infected patients decrease over time, as is common for acute viral infections. Fully documented reinfection cases from Hong Kong, India, Belgium and USA, as well as credible to anecdotal evidence of second-time cases from other countries, bring into sharp focus the question of what profile the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. Here we use mathematical modeling to answer this question, constructing a novel delay differential equation model which is tailored to accommodate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) where a recovered case becomes completely susceptible after a given time interval following infection and (b) where a first-time recovered case becomes susceptible to a lower virulence infection after a given time interval following recovery, and becomes permanently immunized by a second infection. We find possible solutions exhibiting large number of waves of disease in the first situation and two to three waves in the second situation. Interestingly however, these multiple wave solutions are manifest only for some intermediate values of the reproduction number R, which is governed by public health intervention measures. For sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the short-lived immunity. Our results cast insight into the potential spreading dynamics of the disease and might also be useful for analysing the spread after a vaccine is invented, and mass vaccination programs initiated.",B Shayak; Mohit Manoj Sharma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204636,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204636,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
484,Large scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from one region allows detailed epidemiology and enables local outbreak management,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3,200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organisations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1,565 positive samples (172 per 100,000 population) from 1,376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. 1,035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically-distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a sublineage associated with 6 care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients indicating infection control measures were effective; found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.",Andrew J Page; Alison E Mather; Thanh Le Viet; Emma J Meader; Nabil-Fareed J Alikhan; Gemma L Kay; Leonardo de Oliveira Martins; Alp Aydin; David J Baker; Alexander J.

485,Widening the gap: greater racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden after accounting for missing race/ethnicity data,"Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous persons in the United States have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19, due to persistent social inequities. The magnitude of the disparity is unclear, however, because race/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. In this study, we quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias-adjustment for misclassification. After bias-adjustment, the magnitude of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity, measured as the difference in infection rates between classified Black and Hispanic persons compared to classified White persons, increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in infection rates. Collecting race/ethnicity information at time of testing is optimal. However, when data are missing, combined imputation and bias-adjustment improves estimates of the racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.",Katie Labgold; Sarah Hamid; Sarita Shah; Neel R Gandhi; Allison Chamberlain; Fazle Khan; Shamimul Khan; Sasha Smith; Steve Williams; Timothy Lee Lash; Lindsay J Collin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203315,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20203315,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True

Investigation of AI models and statistical models provides important insights within the province of Ontario as a case study application using patients' physiological conditions, symptoms, and demographic information from datasets from Public Health Ontario (PHO) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The findings using XGBoost provide an accuracy of 0.9056 for PHO, and 0.935 for the PHAC datasets. Age is demonstrated to be the most important variable with the next two variables being Hospitalization and Occupation. Further, AI models demonstrate identify the importance of improved medical practice which evolved over the six months in treating COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, and that age is absolutely now the key factor, with much lower importance of other variables that were important to mortality near the beginning of the pandemic. An XGBoost model is shown to be fairly accurate when the training dataset surpasses 1000 cases, indicating that AI has definite potential to be a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19 even when caseload numbers needed for effective utilization of AI model are not large.",Brett Snider; Paige Phillips; Aryn MacLean; Edward A McBean; Andrew Gadsden; John Yawney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20201632,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20201632,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True

Taking Metro Atlanta as a study case, we perform a trend-driven analysis by conducting Kmeans time-series clustering using fine-grained home dwell time records from SafeGraph, and further assess the statistical significance of sixteen demographic/socioeconomic variables from five major categories. We find that demographic/socioeconomic variables can explain the disparity in home dwell time in response to the stay-at-home order, which potentially leads to disparate exposures to the risk from the COVID-19. The results further suggest that socially disadvantaged groups are less likely to follow the order to stay at home, pointing out the extensive gaps in the effectiveness of social distancing measures exist between socially disadvantaged groups and others. Our study reveals that the long-standing inequity issue in the U.S. stands in the way of the effective implementation of social distancing measures. Policymakers need to carefully evaluate the inevitable trade-off among different groups, making sure the outcomes of their policies reflect interests of the socially disadvantaged groups.",Xiao Huang; Zhenlong Li; Junyu Lu; Sicheng Wang; Hanxue Wei; Baixu Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202671,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202671,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
488,Passive Microwave Radiometry (MWR) for diagnostics of COVID-19 lung complications.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 it as a global pandemic. It becomes clear that the virus is spreading mostly deadly due to limited access to diagnostics tests and equipment. Traditional radiography and CT remain the main methods of the initial examination of the chest organs. Now, most of the diagnostics has been focused on PCR, chest X-Ray/CT manifestations of COVID-19. However, there are problems with CT due to infection control issues, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in LMIC (Low Middle Income Countries). Passive microwave radiometry (MWR) is a cheap, non-radioactive and portable technology. It has already been used for diagnostics of cancer, and other diseases. We have tested if MWR could be used for early diagnostics of pulmonary COVID-19 complications. This was a randomized controlled trial (195 subjects) to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics using MWR in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 while they are in hospitals of Kyrgyzstan, and healthy individuals. We have measured skin (IR) and internal (MWR) temperature by recording passive electromagnetic radiation through the chest wall in the projection of the lungs at 30 symmetrical points on both sides. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by X-RAY/CT scan and doctor final diagnosis (pn+/pn-). COVID-19 was determined by PCR test (covid+/covid-). The best results were obtained between pn-/covid- and pn+/covid+ groups with sensitivity 92% and specificity 75%. Overall, the study suggests that the use of MWR is a convenient and safe method for screening diagnostics in COVID-19 patients with suspected pneumonia.

Design--Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Data sources--Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, medRxiv, PROSPERO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Also review of reference lists from recent meta-analyses. Study selection--Randomized clinical trials in which participants were treated with HCQ or placebo/standard-of-care for pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, or outpatient therapy for COVID-19. Methods--Two investigators independently extracted data on trial design and outcomes. Medication side effects and adverse reactions were also assessed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 hospitalization or death. When unavailable, new COVID-19 infection was used. We calculated random effects meta-analysis according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated by calculation of Cochran Q and I2 parameters. An Egger funnel plot was drawn to investigate publication bias. We also calculated the fixed effects meta-analysis summary of the five studies. All calculations were done in Excel, and results were considered to be statistically significant at a two-sided threshold of P=.05. Results--Five randomized controlled clinical trials enrolling 5,577 patients were included. HCQ was associated with a 24% reduction in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization or death, P=.025 (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97]). No serious adverse cardiac events were reported.

490,An integrated clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of severe COVID-19,"Background: Age and gender are often the only considerations in determining risk of severe COVID-19. There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Methods: Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC=0.786) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC=0.635). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors -- not age and gender -- that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. Conclusions: We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.",Gillian S Dite; Nicholas M Murphy; Richard Allman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204453,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204453,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
491,Dry loop mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a major disease burden on many countries around the world. The spread of COVID-19 is anticipated to have a major impact on developing countries including African nations. To establish a point-of-care test for COVID-19, we developed a dry loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. We carried out reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP using the Loopamp SARS-CoV-2 Detection kit (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). The entire mixture except for the primers is dried and immobilized inside the tube lid. To determine the specificity of the kit, 22 viral genomes associated with respiratory infections, including the SARS coronavirus, were tested. No LAMP product was detected in reactions performed with RNA from these pathogens. The sensitivity of this assay, determined by either a real-time turbidity assay or colorimetric change of the reaction mixture, as evaluated by the naked eye or under illumination with ultraviolet light, was 10 copies/reaction. After the initial validation analysis, we analyzed 24 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected to have COVID-19. Nineteen (79.2%) of the 24 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Using the Loopamp SARS-CoV-2 Detection kit, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 15 (62.5%) of the 24 samples. Thus, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Loopamp 2019-CoV-2 detection reagent kit were 94.0%, 96.0%, 95.9%, and 94.1%, respectively. The dry LAMP method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was fast and easy to use, solves the cold chain problem, and therefore represents a promising tool for diagnosis of COVID-19 in developing countries.",Yuki Higashimoto; Masaru Ihira; Yoshiki Kawamura; Masato Inaba; Kazuya Shirato; Tadaki Suzuki; Hideki Hasegawa; Tsutomu Kageyama; Yohei Doi; Tadayoshi Hata; Tetsushi Yoshikawa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204297,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204297,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
492,Ultra-rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in public workspace environments,"Managing the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 requires new capabilities in testing, including the possibility of identifying, in minutes, infected individuals as they enter spaces where they must congregate in a functioning society, including workspaces, schools, points of entry, and commercial business establishments. Here, the only useful tests (a) require no sample transport, (b) require minimal sample manipulation, (c) can be performed by unlicensed individuals, (d) return results on the spot in much less than one hour, and (e) cost no more than a few dollars. The sensitivity need not be as high as normally required by the FDA for screening asymptomatic carriers (as few as 10 virions per sample), as these viral loads are almost certainly not high enough for an individual to present a risk for forward infection. This allows tests specifically useful for this pandemic to trade-off unneeded sensitivity for necessary speed, simplicity, and frugality. In some studies, it was shown that viral load that creates forward-infection risk may exceed 105 virions per milliliter, easily within the sensitivity of an RNA amplification architecture, but unattainable by antibody-based architectures that simply target viral antigens. Here, we describe such a test based on a displaceable probe loop amplification architecture.",Ozlem Yaren; Jacquelyn McCarter; Nikhil Phadke; Kevin M Bradley; Benjamin Overton; Zunyi Yang; Shatakshi Ranade; Kunal Patil; Rishikesh Bangale; STEVEN A BENNER,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204131,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
493,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reverses anti-PD-1 immune murine checkpoint blockade: TCF1 as a marker in humans for COVID-19 and HCQ therapy,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious threat to global public health. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic azithromycin (AZ) are still being used by thousands and numerous hospitals to treat COVID-19. In a related context, immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade (ICB) with antibodies such as anti-PD-1 has revolutionised cancer therapy. Given that cancer patients on ICB continue to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, an understanding of the effects of HCQ and AZ on the elimination of tumors by anti-PD-1 ICB is urgently needed. In this study, we report that HCQ alone, or in combination with AZ, at doses used to treat COVID-19 patients, reverses the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in controlling B16 melanoma tumor growth in mice. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors, or in using AZ alone in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8+CD44+PD-1+TCF1+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8+CD44+PD-1+ effectors. Surprisingly, it also blocked the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4+ T-cells, FoxP3+ Tregs, thymic subsets, B-cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice. Lastly, we identified TCF-1 expression in peripheral CD8+ T-cells from cancer or non-cancer human patients infected with SARs CoV2 as a marker for the effects of COVID-19 and HCQ on the immune system. This study indicates for the first time that HCQ and HCQ/AZ negatively impact the ability of anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade to promote tumor rejection.",Janna Kreuger; Francois Santinon; Alexandra Kazanova; Mark Issa; Bruno Larrivee; Catalin Milhalcioiu; Christopher E.

494,"Global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination","Abstract Background COVID-19 vaccine prioritization and allocation strategies that maximize health benefit through efficient use of limited resources are urgently needed. We aimed to provide global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination to inform country-specific immunization strategies on a global scale. Methods Based on a previous study of international allocation for pandemic COVID-19 vaccines, we classified the entire world population into eleven priority groups. Information on priority groups was derived from a multi-pronged search of official websites, media sources and academic journal articles. The sizes of different priority groups were projected for 194 countries globally. Results Overall, the size of COVID-19 vaccine recipient population varied markedly by goals of the vaccination program and geography. The general population aged <60 years without any underlying condition accounts for the majority of the total population (5.2 billion people, 68%), followed by 2.3 billion individuals at risk of severe disease, and 46.9 million essential workers which are critical to maintaining a functional society. Differences in the demographic structure, presence of underlying conditions, and number of essential workers led to highly variable estimates of target populations both at the WHO region and country level. In particular, Europe has the highest share of essential workers (6.8%) and the highest share of individuals with underlying conditions (37.8%), two priority categories to maintain societal functions and reduce severe burden. In contrast, Africa has the highest share of healthy adults, school-age individuals, and infants (77.6%), which are the key groups to target to reduce community transmission. Interpretation The sizeable distribution of target groups on a country and regional bases underlines the importance of equitable and efficient vaccine prioritization and allocation globally. The direct and indirect benefits of COVID-19 vaccination should be balanced by considering local differences in demography and health.",Wei Wang; Qianhui Wu; Juan Yang; Kaige Dong; Xinghui Chen; Xufang Bai; Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; C&eacutecile Viboud; Marco Ajelli; Hongjie Yu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20200469,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20200469,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
495,Virus evolution affected early COVID-19 spread,"As the SARS-Cov-2 virus spreads around the world afflicting millions of people, it has undergone divergent genetic mutations. Although most of these mutations are expected to be inconsequential, some mutations in the spike protein structure have been hypothesized to affect the critical stage at which the virus invades human cells, which could affect transmission probability and disease expression. If true, then we expect an increased growth rate of reported COVID-19 cases in regions dominated by viruses with these altered proteins. We modeled early global infection dynamics based on clade assignment along with other demographic and meteorological factors previously found to be important. Clade, but not variant D614G which has been associated with increased viral load, enhanced our ability to describe early COVID-19 growth dynamics. Including clade identity in models significantly improved predictions over earlier work based only on weather and demographic variables. In particular, higher proportions of clade 19A and 19B were negatively correlated with COVID-19 growth rate, whereas higher proportions of 20A and 20C were positively correlated with growth rate. A strong interaction between the prevalence of clade 20C and relative humidity suggests that the impact of clade identity might be more important when coupled with certain weather conditions. In particular, 20C an 20A generate the highest growth rates when coupled with low humidity. Projections based on data through April 2020 suggest that, without intervention, COVID-19 has the potential to grow more quickly in regions dominated by the 20A and 20C clades, including most of South and North America.",Derek Corcoran; Mark C Urban; Jill Wegrzyn; Cory Merow,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20202416,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20202416,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
496,Estimation of novel coronavirus (covid-19) reproduction number and case fatality rate: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Understanding the transmission dynamics and the severity of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) informs public health interventions, surveillance, and planning. Two important parameters, the basic reproduction number (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19, help in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R0 and CFR of COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. We carried out a systematic review to retrieve the published estimates of the R0 and the CFR in articles from international databases between 1st January and 31st August 2020. Random-effect models and Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of the R0 and the CFR. Furthermore, the R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where studies were conducted. The I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test were applied to assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected studies. Forty-five studies involving R0 and thirty-four studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of the R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied significantly, from 2.51 (2.12, 2.95) in Asia to 7.11 (6.38, 7.91) in Africa. We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs. 2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs. 2.27). However, the R0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. An R0 of 2.69 and CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19. Although R0 and CFR may vary over time, space, and demographics, we recommend considering these figures in control and prevention measures.",Tanvir Ahammed; Aniqua Anjum; Mohammad Meshbahur Rahman; Najmul Haider; Richard Kock; Md.

497,Propagation of Viral Bioaerosols Indoors,"Here we look into the spread of aerosols indoors that may potentially carry viruses. Many viruses, including the novel Covid-19, are known to spread via airborne and air-dust pathways. From the literature data and our own research on the propagation of fine aerosols, we simulate herein the carryover of viral aerosols in indoor air. We demonstrate that a great deal of fine droplets released from an infected person coughing, sneezing or talking propagate very fast and to large distances indoors, as well as bend around obstacles, lift up and down over staircases, and so on. This study suggests equations to evaluate the concentration of those droplets, depending on time and distance from the source of infection. Estimates are given for the safe distance to the source of infection, and available methods for neutralizing viral aerosols indoors are considered.",Olga B Kudryashova; Evgeny V Muravlev; Alexandra A Antonnikova,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20199943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20199943,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
498,Forecasting Covid-19 Infections and Deaths Horizon in Egypt,"The coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic is defining a global health crisis, which is the hugest challenge the world has faced since World War II. Accordingly, the global economy as well is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and/or evaluating countermeasures. The aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible. The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be 5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or transmitted is necessary. Besides, being prepared with re-imposing lockdown strategies and health system support are essential among others. It should also be noted that this expected pattern can shift, yet that depends on people's actions.",Shereen Nosier; Reham Salah Beram,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202911,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202911,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
499,Viral genomes reveal patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Washington State,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has gravely impacted societies around the world. Outbreaks in different parts of the globe are shaped by repeated introductions of new lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State (USA) was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we see evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we do not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient outcomes. Overall, this suggests that at least to date, the behavior of individuals has been more important in shaping the course of the pandemic than changes in the virus.",Nicola Felix Mueller; Cassia Wagner; Chris D.

500,Spectrum of spinal cord involvement in COVID-19: A systematic review,"Background and aims- Recent reports reveal incidences of spinal cord involvement in form of para-infectious or post-infectious myelitis raising potential concerns about the possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 behind the pathogenesis of spinal cord demyelination. In this study, we intend to summarise so far available pieces of evidence documenting SARS-CoV-2 mediated spinal demyelination in terms of clinical, laboratory parameters and imaging characteristics. Methodology- This review was carried out based on the existing PRISMA (Preferred Report for Systemic Review and Meta-analyses) consensus statement. Data was collected from four databases: Pubmed/Medline, NIH Litcovid, Embase and Cochrane library and Preprint servers up till 10th September, 2020. Search strategy comprised of a range of keywords from relevant medical subject headings which includes ""SARS-COV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""demyelination"" etc. Results- A total of 21 cases were included from 21 case reports after screening from various databases and preprint servers. Biochemical analysis reveals that the majority of cases showed elevated CSF protein as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis. Interestingly, a majority of cases were found to be associated with long extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), and remaining cases were found to be associated with isolated patchy involvement or isolated short segment involvement or combined LETM and patchy involvement. Few cases were also found with significant co-involvement of the brain and spine based on the imaging data.

501,Projected HIV and Bacterial STI Incidence Following COVID-Related Sexual Distancing and Clinical Service Interruption,"BACKGROUND. The global COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to indirectly impact the transmission dynamics and prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Studies have already documented reductions in sexual activity (""sexual distancing"") and interruptions in HIV/STI services, but it is unknown what combined impact these two forces will have on longer-term HIV/STI epidemic trajectories. METHODS. We adapted a network-based model of co-circulating HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia for a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta area. Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-related sexual distancing in casual and one-time partnership networks and service interruption within four service categories (HIV screening, HIV PrEP, HIV ART, and STI treatment). RESULTS. A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM: -227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (-23,800 cases). Greater relative reductions and longer durations of service interruption would increase HIV and STI incidence, while greater relative reductions and longer durations of sexual distancing would decrease incidence of both. If distancing lasted only 3 months but service interruption lasted 18 months, the total 5-year population impact would be an additional 890 HIV cases and 57,500 STI cases. CONCLUSIONS. The counterbalancing impact of sexual distancing and clinical service interruption depends on the infection and the extent and durability of these COVID-related changes. If sexual behavior rebounds while service interruption persists, we project an excess of hundreds of HIV cases and thousands of STI cases just among Atlanta MSM over the next 5 years. Immediate action to limit the impact of service interruptions is needed to address the indirect effects of the global COVID pandemic on the HIV/STI epidemic.",Samuel M Jenness; Adrien Le Guillou; Christina Chandra; Laura M Mann; Travis Sanchez; Daniel Westreich; Julia L Marcus,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204529,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20204529,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
502,Mitigating the transmission of infection and death due to SARS-CoV-2 through non-pharmaceutical interventions and repurposing drugs,"The Covid-19 pandemic has put the world under immeasurable stress. There is no specific drug or vaccine that can cure the infection or protect people from the infection of coronavirus. It is therefore prudent to use the existing resources and control strategies in an optimal way to contain the virus spread and provide the best possible treatments to the infected individuals. Use of the repurposing drugs along with the non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies may be the right way for fighting against the ongoing pandemic. It is the objective of this work to demonstrate through mathematical modelling and analysis how and to what extent such control strategies can improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden. The criteria for disease elimination & persistence were established through the basic reproduction number. A case study with the Indian Covid-19 epidemic data is presented to visualize and illustrate the effects of lockdown, maintaining personal hygiene & safe distancing, and repurposing drugs. It is shown that India can significantly improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden through the combined use of NPIs and repurposing drugs though containment of spreading is difficult without serious community participation.",Chittaranjan Mondal; Debadatta Adak; Abhijit Majumder; Nandadulal Bairagi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202804,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.20202804,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True

CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilize RNA and DNA-targeting enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and accurate. Here we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a-based mobile phone assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA extracts. The assay achieved ~100 copies/L sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Combined with mobile phone-based quantification, this assay can provide rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening to aid in the control of SARS-CoV-2.",Parinaz Fozouni; Sungmin Son; María Díaz de León Derby; Gavin J Knott; Carley N Gray; Michael V D'Ambrosio; Chunyu Zhao; Neil A Switz; G.

504,"Evaluation of high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in a longitudinal cohort of mild COVID-19 patients: sensitivity, specificity and association with virus neutralization test","Objectives: We evaluated widely-used SARS-CoV-2 serological tests and their potential association with virus neutralization test (VNT) in a cohort of mild COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 439 specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19. Nine serological assays developed by leading global companies (Abbott, DiaSorin, Siemens, Bio-Rad, Wantai, bioMerieux, Euroimmun) were assessed. For each test the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined weekly after symptom onset. Correlation and concordance were assessed using the Spearman and Cohen Kappa coefficients, respectively. Positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the VNT were also determined. Results: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The best correlation between antibody level and neutralizing antibody titer was found with the Euroimmun S1-based IgA assay (Spearman coefficient [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.61-0.79]). A moderate concordance (Kappa [95%CI]: 0.43[0.23-0.63]) as well as the lowest NPA (33%) was found between the Wantai Total Ab assay and the VNT. Compared to the Wantai Total Ab assay, other total Ab or IgG assays targeting the S or the RBD (bioMerieux, DiaSorin, Siemens,) were more concordant with the VNT (Kappa>0.7 for the three tests) and had a higher NPA (range: 90% to 97%). Conclusions: Although some assays presented a better concordance with VNT than others, the present findings emphasize that commercialized serological tests including those targeting the RBD cannot substitute VNT for the assessment of functional antibody response.",Antonin Bal; Bruno Pozzetto; Mary-Anne Trabaud; Vanessa Escuret; Muriel Rabilloud; Carole Langlois-jacques; Adele Paul; Nicolas Guibert; Constance D'aubarde; Amelie Massardier; Andre Boibieux; Florence Morfin; Virginie Pitiot; Francois Gueyffier; Bruno Lina; Jean Baptiste Fassier; Sophie Assant,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20194290,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20194290,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
505,Geospatial Analysis of Individual and Community-Level Socioeconomic Factors Impacting SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence and Outcomes,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority communities across the United States. We sought to disentangle individual and census tract-level sociodemographic and economic factors associated with these disparities. Methods and Findings: All adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1 and June 21, 2020 were geocoded to a census tract based on their address; hospital employees and individuals with invalid addresses were excluded. Individual (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, insurance) and census tract-level (demographics, insurance, income, education, employment, occupation, household crowding and occupancy, built home environment, and transportation) variables were analyzed using linear mixed models predicting infection, hospitalization, and death from SARS-CoV-2. Among 57,865 individuals, per capita testing rates, individual (older age, male sex, non-White race, non-English preferred language, and non-private insurance), and census tract-level (increased population density, higher household occupancy, and lower education) measures were associated with likelihood of infection. Among those infected, individual age, sex, race, language, and insurance, and census tract-level measures of lower education, more multi-family homes, and extreme household crowding were associated with increased likelihood of hospitalization, while higher per capita testing rates were associated with decreased likelihood. Only individual-level variables (older age, male sex, Medicare insurance) were associated with increased mortality among those hospitalized. Conclusions: This study of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a major U.S. city presents the cascade of outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection within a large, multi-ethnic cohort. SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization rates, but not death rates among those hospitalized, are related to census tract-level socioeconomic characteristics including lower educational attainment and higher household crowding and occupancy, but not neighborhood measures of race, independent of individual factors.",Sara J Cromer; Chirag M Lakhani; Deborah J Wexler; Sherri-Ann M Burnett-Bowie; Miriam Udler; Chirag J Patel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20201830,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20201830,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True

Between 16th April and 15th June 2020, 2,312 residual sera were collected from patients having carried out a blood analysis in one of the participating laboratories. Residual sera obtained from persons of all ages were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG using the EUROIMMUN enzyme immunoassay kit for semiquantitative detection of IgG antibodies against S1 domain of viral spike protein (ELISA-S). Borderline and positive samples in ELISA-S were also tested with an in-house virus neutralization test (VNT). Prevalence values were adjusted for sex and age. A total of 1,973 residual sera samples were included in the study. The overall seroprevalence based on ELISA-S was 5.27% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.33-6.35] and 5.46% [4.51-6.57] after adjustment. Gender was not associated with IgG detection.

507,Psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic in Chile: the role of economic uncertainty,"Previous research has shown that the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing and lockdown can affect people's psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to estimate the extent to which perceptions and expectations regarding the social, economic and domestic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are associated with psychological distress, and identify some demographic, psychosocial and economic factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile. 1078 people participated in a telephone survey between May 30 and June 10, 2020. The sample is representative of the Chilean adult population. Psychological distress was assessed through a questionnaire of anxious and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). We analyze the data set using ordinary least-squares regression models, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then stratifying the sample into different groups to explore differences by gender and age. 19.2% participants displayed significant psychological distress, with moderate to severe anxiety-depression symptoms being more prevalent in women than in men (23.9% vs 14.09%, chi square 6.89, p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that being a woman, feeling lonely and isolated, living in the areas hit hardest by the pandemic and lockdown, expecting a lack of income due to having to stop working as a consequence of the pandemic, and having a history of mental health diagnosis are significantly associated with psychological distress (p < 0.05). The results of this study highlight the need to implement psychosocial programs to protect people's psychological well-being and social policies to address economic uncertainty during the current COVID-19 outbreak in Chile.",Fabian Duarte; Alvaro Jimenez-Molina,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202648,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202648,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
508,Examining Australian public perceptions and behaviors towards a future COVID-19 vaccine,"Background: There is an indication that vaccine(s) for COVID-19 could be available by early 2021. As immunisation program launches have previously demonstrated, it is essential that careful planning occurs now to ensure the readiness of the public for a COVID-19 vaccine. As part of that process, this study aimed to understand the public perceptions regarding a future COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Participants generally held positive views towards vaccination. Eighty percent (n=1143) agreed with the statement that getting myself vaccinated for COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection. Females (614, 83%) were more likely to agree with the statement than males (529, 78%) (aOR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8); P=0.029), while 90.9% aged 70 and above agreed compared to 76.6% aged 18-29 year old (aOR=2.3 (95% CI:1.2-4.1); 0.008). Agreement was also higher for those with a self-reported chronic disease (aOR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0); P=0.043) and among those who held private health insurance (aOR=1.7 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3); P<0.001). Beyond individual perceptions, 78% stated that their decision to vaccinate would be supported by family and friends Conclusion: This study presents an early indication of public perceptions towards a future COVID-19 vaccine and represents a starting point for mapping vaccine perceptions. To support an effective launch of these new vaccines, governments need to use this time to understand the communities concerns and to identify the strategies that will support engagement.",Holly Seale; Anita E Heywood; Julie Leask; Meru Sheel; David N Durrheim; Katarzyna Bolsewicz; Rajneesh Kaur,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204396,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204396,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
509,Identification of biological correlates associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with participants recruited from Italy and Spain by an international consortium group. Methods: Summary GWAS statistics for 1610 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and 2205 controls were downloaded. In the current study, we analyzed the summary statistics with the information of loci and p-values for 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using gene ontology analysis to determine the top biological processes implicated in respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Results: We considered the top 708 SNPs, using a p-value cutoff of 5x10-5, which were mapped to the nearest genes, leading to 144 unique genes. The list of genes was input into a curated database to conduct gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. The top-ranked biological processes were wound healing, epithelial structure maintenance, muscle system processes, and cardiac-relevant biological processes with a false discovery rate < 0.05. In the PPI analysis, the largest connected network consisted of 8 genes. Through literature search, 7 out of the 8 genes were found to be implicated in both pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Conclusion: Gene ontology and protein-protein interaction analyses identified cardio-pulmonary processes that may partially explain the risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.",Jung Hun Oh; Allen Tannenbaum; Joseph Deasy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204289,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.20204289,2020-09-30,2020-09-30,,True
