0,Dynamic patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep during the first month of strict lockdown in two women with major depressive disorder,"Mental health research community needs to collect high-quality data to understand the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures in adults with mental disorders. Our aims were to document the day-to-day patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep parameters, and explore the dynamic network structure of measured depressive symptoms during the first four weeks of strict lockdown in two women with major depressive disorder. Data from ecological momentary assessments have been analyzed with idiographic models. In both cases, the self-reported depressive symptoms and core affects fluctuated during the lowckdown. All measured depressive symptoms were not exacerbated and showed different patterns of variation. Psychomotor retardation and level of arousal played a prominent role in the dynamic symptom networks. These case studies contribute to our understanding of the lockdown effects on depressive symptoms and affective experiences, and highlight the need of person-centered mental health care to help people with major depressive disorder during a lockdown.",Paquito Bernard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,2020-07-14,2020-07-14T22:43:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; idiographic; sleep; insomnia; covid-19; depressive symptoms,False
1,Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. We leverage natural language processing to characterize linguistic changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch) found on the website Reddit, along with other non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy). We create the Reddit Mental Health Dataset containing posts from 826,961 unique users spanning 28 Reddit groups from 2018 to 2020. We then analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as isolation and economic stress. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups and were the same groups that became most similar linguistically to the health anxiety support group as COVID-19 spread. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. We uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language and highlight different types of concerns and at-risk online users that require clinical attention. We demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to capture mental health complaints as they arise in real time and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events.",Daniel Mark Low et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1,2020-07-13,2020-07-14T22:04:46+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Bipolar and Related Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; psychiatry; covid-19; health anxiety; natural language processing; adhd; mental health; reddit; machine learning; eating disorders",False
2,Predicting COVID-19 conspiracist ideation from the Dark Tetrad traits,"Previous research has suggested that the Dark Triad traits and, specifically, Machiavellianism and psychopathy, are associated with a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. The current study (N = 203) aimed to replicate and extend the existing research by examining the relationship between the Dark Tetrad traits—Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and everyday sadism—and a novel measure of COVID-19 conspiracist ideation. Machiavellian views and psychopathic antisociality were significant positive predictors of the tendency to believe in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, even when accounting for the participants’ knowledge about COVID-19. Overall, the results suggest that some (but not all) aspects of the Dark Tetrad are associated with COVID-19 conspiracist ideation.",Cameron Stuart Kay,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612F-8E1-146,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612F-8E1-146,2020-07-14,2020-07-14T21:46:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
3,Development of the Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS),"Abstract Parenting is critical to creating and maintaining healthy child development. Importantly, there are multiple determinants of effective parenting, including the psychological resources of the parent, contextual sources of stress and support, and characteristics of the child. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in colossal disruptions to family life, and has fundamentally altered the landscape of parenting. In the face of escalating infection and mortality rates, rising unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders, parents have had to create new environments in which their children can flourish while, in many cases, continuing to juggle ongoing work, health, and emotional stressors of their own. Several recent reviews have offered a variety of recommendations for parents to promote child well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no measures have been developed to assess how parents have adapted their parenting behaviors in response to the pandemic. To better understand the lasting impact of the pandemic on children’s socioemotional health and well-being, we urgently need to characterize the impact of the pandemic on parenting practices. Accordingly, the current study developed the 24-item Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS) to assess behaviors enacted by parents to mitigate infection risk, manage children’s social and emotional needs, structure children’s activities, help with schoolwork or education, and promote physical activity. The scale is available in English and Spanish and is freely accessible for research, educational, or scientific purposes. We anticipate the PIPS being employed in studies alongside other, validated measures of parenting practices, parenting stress, or parental burnout, as well as in relation to measures of child mental health and resilience in the face of the pandemic.",Rebecca Waller et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3,2020-07-14,2020-07-14T21:34:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; family; dads; childhood; parents; moms; home environment; children; covid-19; adolescence; parenting practices; parent-child relationships; parenting,False
4,Religion and Reactance to COVID-19 Mitigation Guidelines,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, religious gatherings have become intense hot spots for the spread of the virus. In this research, we focus on the religiosity of communities to examine whether religiosity helps or hinders adherence to mitigation policies such as shelter-in-place directives. Prior research makes opposing predictions as to the influence of religiosity. One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies while another predicts lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasi-experiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people’s movements. However, when the directive was imposed, higher religiosity resulted in less adherence to shelter-in-place directives.",David Defranza et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-96F-E06,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-96F-E06,2020-07-14,2020-07-14T21:33:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Religion and Spirituality; covid-19; religion; econometrics; reactance,False
5,Beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories predict lower level of compliance with the preventive measures both directly and indirectly by lowering trust in government medical officials,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a global health crisis, making compliance with governmental policies and public health advice crucial in decreasing transmission rates. At the same time, we are faced with the rapid spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the predictive power of COVID-19 conspiracy theories in explaining the level of compliance with official COVID-19 guidelines, by including mediating roles of pseudoscientific information beliefs and trust in government officials. A total of 1882 participants provided sociodemographic information and completed all measures in the study. Multiple mediation analysis revealed a direct negative effect of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs on the compliance with the preventive measures. In addition, conspiracy beliefs were indirectly associated with compliance via trust in government officials. The present study builds upon emerging research showing that conspiracy beliefs have potentially significant social consequences. Practical implications of these findings are further discussed.",Irena Pavela Banai et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C4-112-EA7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C4-112-EA7,2020-07-14,2020-07-14T14:40:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; conspiracy theory; preventive measures; pandemic; compliance; covid-19; pseudoscience,False
6,"Psychological Research on the COVID-19 Crisis in Japan: Focusing on Infection Preventive Behaviors, Future Prospects, and Information Dissemination Behaviors","The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious problem all over the world in 2020. In this study, a large-scale online survey was conducted in Japan to explore the determinants of infection preventive behaviors. In addition, this survey collected data on various attitudes and behaviors in this pandemic situation, including optimistic/pessimistic views and information dissemination behavior on social networking sites (SNS). The results showed that the infection risk perception of self and others were both associated with the preventive behaviors, but the social pressure was not. The results were unclear in regard to optimistic/pessimistic views for infection risk perception and prospect for the end of coronavirus outbreak. Surprisingly, information spreading via SNS was negatively associated with knowledge of COVID-19, which calls attention to the credibility of information on SNS. In addition, subjective evaluation of achievement in regard to preventive behaviors was higher for self than for other people. This suggests that a self-enhancement tendency may contribute to the evaluation of preventive behaviors. Despite limitations such as employing a cross-sectional survey design and using data collected only in Japan, our study provides useful insights into the determinants of infection preventive behaviors, information dissemination, and the self-enhancement tendency in the evaluation of preventive behaviors. These findings should be useful in preventing the spread of COVID-19 around the world and in preparing for a possible future pandemic.",Ryota Sakakibara et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CC-D29-1D1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CC-D29-1D1,2020-07-13,2020-07-14T14:39:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; pandemic; infection preventive behavior; optimism; culture; information dissemination behavior; covid-19,False
7,The quality of research on mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic: A note of caution after a systematic review,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fields of knowledge, including mental health. Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This systematic review aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open science practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases on the 13th of May. Empirical studies, published in peer-reviewed journals in English, between February and May 2020, were included. The dependent variable(s) required to be quantitative and related to mental health. Exclusion criteria included clinical pharmacological trials, and studies using psychophysiological or biological recordings. The study protocol was previously pre-registered in https://osf.io/bk3gw/. Findings: Twenty-eight studies were identified. More than 75% met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, 89.3% used convenience samples and 92.86% lacked of a priori power analysis. There was low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies (0%) and availability of databases (3.57%), which raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Interpretation: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good science.",Ines Nieto et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-73A-AF7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-73A-AF7,2020-07-14,2020-07-14T14:36:42+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; mental health; systematic review; covid-19; research quality",False
8,A psychological network approach to factors related to preventive behaviors during pandemics: A European COVID-19 study,"Preventive behaviors are crucial in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Given the multifaceted nature of this pandemic, we adopted a complex psychological systems approach to obtain insight into the interplay and mutual dependence of factors related to adopting these behaviors, including attitudes, social norms, trust and health. We therefore conducted a survey study (n=1022) with subsamples from the United Kingdom (n=502) and Netherlands (n=520). The results highlight the importance of people’s support for, and perceived efficacy of, the measures and preventive behaviors, and of the perceived norm of their family and friends adopting these behaviors. The relation of these factors with other factors in the network is also highlighted. Future research should study effects of interventions aimed at these factors, including effects on the network. Finally, while the networks in both countries were largely similar, we observed notable differences that are possibly reflections of the different trajectories of this pandemic.",Monique Chambon et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46218-177-57F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46218-177-57F,2020-07-01,2020-07-14T11:22:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; covid-19; preventive behaviors; compliance; pandemic; complex systems,False
9,Appealing to economic (vs. health) risk may be more effective to fight COVID-19: A multilevel analysis in 24 countries,"This paper examines whether compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures is motivated by wanting to save lives or save the economy (or both), and which implications this carries to fight the pandemic. National representative samples were collected from 24 countries (N=25,435). The main predictors were (i) perceived risk to contract coronavirus, (ii) perceived risk to suffer economic losses due to coronavirus, and (iii) their interaction effect. Individual and country-level variables were added as covariates in multilevel regression models. We examined compliance with various preventive health behaviors and support for strict containment policies. Results show that perceived economic risk consistently predicted mitigation behavior and policy support - and its effects were positive. Perceived health risk had mixed effects. Only two significant interactions between health and economic risk were identified – both positive. These results do not corroborate the view that people engage in health versus economy zero-sum thinking in the fight against COVID-19.",Claudia F Nisa et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A8-67D-126,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A8-67D-126,2020-07-01,2020-07-14T02:28:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
10,"Conspiratorial thinking during COVID-19: The roles of paranoia, delusion-proneness, and intolerance to uncertainty","The COVID-19 global pandemic has left many feeling a sense of profound uncertainty about their world, safety, and livelihood. Explanatory frameworks to make sense of this uncertainty are offered by both official health-organizations as well as sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Individual differences that predispose towards conspiratorial thinking (CT) have been investigated by past work, but never in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global pandemic. In the present study we show that endorsement of COVID-19-specific conspiracy theories is associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty, delusion-proneness, and paranoid ideation. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia mediated the relationship between intolerance to uncertainty and CT, and emerged as independent partial predictors of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in intolerance to uncertainty, delusion-proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of crisis and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide evidence that specific individual differences can create susceptibility to misinformation and may have implications for message framing strategies when designing informational interventions.",Emmett M.

11,The Impact of the Certainty of Information on COVID-19 Attitudes in Spanish University Teachers and Students,"The COVID-19 pandemic affects the whole world. Spain is one of the most affected nations. Prevention via information that fosters knowledge, reasonable concern, control and personal care is the most effective means to slow down the pandemic. In this intervention study we assessed extant knowledge, concern, control and care about the COVID-19 in 111 Spanish university teachers and students. Subsequently, we randomly assigned them to two groups. One group (n = 53) received uncertain information about the current measures of prevention whereas the other group (n = 58) received certain information. A group by time interaction revealed that the ‘certain information’ group reported immediately increased personal care about the pandemic. These findings suggest that measures known to be effective in COVID-19 prevention should be communicated with certainty (i.e. must be convincing) to influence people’s attitudes through the schematic organization of new information.",Ricardo De La Vega et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601A-5F8-A35,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601A-5F8-A35,2020-07-13,2020-07-13T20:12:31+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
12,How handling extreme C-reactive protein (CRP) values influences CRP and depression symptom networks: A replication and extension of Fried et al. (2019),"Increasingly, it has been recognized that analysis at the symptom, rather than diagnostic, level will drive progress in the field of immunopsychiatry. Network analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all other variables modeled. However, these analyses require a lot of power and replication is key to determine their utility in this context. Additionally, further investigation into how methodological decisions (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. The current study attempts to replicate Fried et al. (2019), which found CRP to be uniquely associated with sleep problems, fatigue, and changes in appetite. In a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite, no support for an association between CRP and sleep, and some support for additional CRP—symptom associations. Methodologically, results consistently demonstrated that including individuals with CRP > 10 mg/L and estimating nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations.

13,Depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions in Germany.,"Since the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Germany, various lockdown measures were imposed across the country that likely had a large impact on psychological well-being. In the current study, we investigate depressive symptoms as depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease and potentially life-threatening. This study reports on a dataset that was collected between April 8 and June 1 2020 through an online survey in several German states. More than 2000 individuals took part in the survey measuring depressive symptoms (as defined in ICD-10). Similar to recent observations from Italy and China, severe depressive symptoms reported were relatively high. Especially younger adults and females reported more severe symptoms compared to other groups. In conclusion, we need to prepare for increased need of psychological services, availability and accessibility already parallel with imposing restrictive measures.",Iris Schelhorn et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46204-E18-EC0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46204-E18-EC0,2020-07-13,2020-07-13T20:09:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; online survey; covid-19; depression,False
14,Trust in government and its associations with health behaviour and prosocial behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Previous studies suggested that public trust in government is vital for implementations of social policies that rely on public's behavioural responses. This study examined associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours. Data from an international survey with representative samples (N=23,733) of 23 countries were analysed. Specification curve analysis showed that higher trust in government was significantly associated with higher adoption of health and prosocial behaviours in all reasonable specifications of multilevel linear models (median standardised β=0.173 and 0.244, P<0.001). We further used structural equation modelling to explore potential determinants of trust in government regarding pandemic control. Governments perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised β=0.358, 0.230, 0.055, and 0.250, P<0.01).

15,Examining Mindset and Grit in Concurrent and Future Reading Comprehension: A Twin Study,"Non-cognitive factors have gained attention in recent years as potential intervention targets for academic achievement improvement in students. Two notable facets, intelligence mindset and grit, have been of particular interest. Both have been shown to consistently improve educational outcomes, although little work has focused on reading ability. We used a correlational and twin method design to preliminary test if mindset and grit could be potential intervention targets to increase reading ability. As such, we examined the relation between both grit and mindset on current, future, and change in reading comprehension ability in a twin sample. We used data from 422 twin pairs (171 monozygotic pairs, 251 dizygotic pairs) drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, Behavior and Environment (Taylor et al., 2019). Twins were on average 13 years old when the questionnaire and first reading ability measure were collected, and on average 15 years old when the second reading ability measure was collected. Weak and moderate positive correlations were found between both mindset and grit with each reading ability score and neither were significantly related to change in reading ability. Twin modeling suggested little to no common genetic or environmental influences between mindset and grit to reading ability. In total, our results do not lend support to the notion of mindset or grit being a mechanism of change for reading ability.",Kimberly M.

16,Bargaining under social distancing requirements: Effects of face masks on socio-economic decision-making in the COVID-19 pandemic,"Face masks play a pivotal role in the control and prevention of respiratory diseases, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Despite their widespread use, it is not known how face masks affect human social interaction. In this behavioral economics study (N = 475), we examined how mask-wearing modulates individuals’ likelihood of acceptance of unfair monetary offers in an iterated social exchange. Overall, participants accepted more offers, including more unfair offers, from mask-wearing opponents than from opponents without a mask. This effect was enhanced when participants ascribed more altruistic motives to their interaction partner. Importantly, this pattern of results was only present for surgical face masks, but not when a non-medical cloth face covering was used. This is the first study to uncover a new phenomenon, the face-mask effect, in which face masks can alter human social behavior.",Ramzi Fatfouta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F4-076-388,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F4-076-388,2020-07-10,2020-07-11T13:19:47+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; social cognition; fairness; construal level theory; ultimatum game; decision making; covid-19",False
17,Heart Rate Variability Moderates the Link Between COVID-19 Stress and Emotional Problems in Adolescents: Evidence for Differential Susceptibility,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress and uncertainty that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress about COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents’ mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress. Approximately four years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19 and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or lower HRV reactivity, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Thus, parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress on mental health during the pandemic.",Jonas G.

18,Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden,"New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens.

19,Cyclical Across-Day Dynamics of Corona-Related Media Exposure and Worries in People’s Daily Lives During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: This study investigated how Corona-related media exposure during the COVID-19 crisis was related to same-day and next-day Corona-related worries. Methods: A sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12) completed online questionnaires across 21 days between late March and April 2020 in Germany. Every evening, they indicated their exposure to Corona-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their Corona-related worries on that day. Results: Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more Corona-related worries on days with higher exposure to Corona-related media. Examining the across-day relations among Corona-related media exposure and worries using dynamical structural equation models, there was evidence for a reciprocal cycle: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of Corona-related media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of Corona-related worries. Conclusions: These findings suggest a self-reinforcing cycle of crisis-related media exposure and worries. As such, the daily amount people spend consuming crisis-related information might augment crisis-related worries, amplifying adverse health effects of the COVID-19 crisis and other crises alike.",Andrea Schmidt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FD-FF9-E4A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FD-FF9-E4A,2020-06-17,2020-07-10T07:17:23+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; covid-19; worry; within-person dynamics; media exposure; ambulatory assessment; daily diary; well-being",False
20,The pathogen paradox: Evidence that perceived COVID-19 threat is associated with both pro- and anti-immigrant attitudes,"COVID-19 pandemic, as a global threat to humanity, is likely to instigate a variety of collective responses in the society. We examined, for the first time, whether COVID-19 threat perception is related to attitudes towards Syrian immigrants in Turkey, theorizing a dual pathway whereby threat caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would relate to both pro- and anti-immigrant feelings. While drawing upon behavioral immune system theory, we expected that pathogen threat would lead to more exclusionary attitudes; relying on the common ingroup identity model, we predicted that pathogen threat would promote inclusionary attitudes through creating a common ingroup in the face of a global threat. Results from two studies using online search volume data at the province-level (N = 81) and self-report measures at the individual level (N = 294) demonstrated that perceived COVID-19 threat was directly associated with more positive attitudes towards immigrants (Study 1 and 2). Study 2 further revealed indirect positive (through a sense of common identity) and negative (through perceptions of immigrant threat) links between COVID-19 threat perception and attitudes towards immigrants. These results highlight the importance of integrating evolutionary and social identity perspectives when assessing pathogen-related threats. We draw attention to managing the public perceptions of COVID-19 threat which may mitigate the social aftermath of the pandemic.",Jais Adam-Troian et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46013-66A-16F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46013-66A-16F,2020-07-09,2020-07-09T12:39:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Diversity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intergroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Violence and Aggression; attitudes; common ingroup; social identity; pathogen threat; intergroup relations; refugees; prejudice; covid-19; syrians; immigrants; turkey,False
21,Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the U.S.,"Background: Stressful events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have significant effects on psychiatric symptoms, and well-validated methods for assessing psychosocial experiences related to the pandemic are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess the stability of the PSQ and prospective associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity and stability of the PSQ and indicated that experiences of stress are highly prevalent, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with depression and anxiety at each assessment, but did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: The PSQ is a promising measure for assessing COVID-19 pandemic-related events in research and clinical practice. Results provide empirical support for the range of life disruptions as a result of the pandemic and highlight individual differences and experiences associated with the greatest risk for depression and anxiety.",Autumn Kujawa et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,2020-06-29,2020-07-08T22:48:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; coronavirus; young adult; pandemics; depression; anxiety,False
22,PERSONALITY TRAITS AND NARCISSISM AS PREDICTORS OF PATHOLOGICAL SELFIE AMONG UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATES IN NIGERIA,"This study examined personality traits and narcissistic as predictors of pathological selfie among undergraduates of university of Ilorin. An ex post-facto design using survey method was adopted while three hundred respondents (110 males and 190 females), participated in the study. Their age ranged from 16 years to 35years. A questionnaire pack which included-the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-16 (NPI-16); the Big Five Inventory (BFI); and Selfie Behaviour Scale (SBS) was utilized. The results of t-test revealed that gender do not significantly influence pathological selfies (t=.763; df= 298; p>.05). However, there was a significant difference in the participants type of phones on selfie pathology (t (120)=-3.01, p<.05); respondents with smart phones (M=56.89, SD=10.25) significantly reported higher scores on pathological selfies compare to respondents with non-smart phones (M=53.23, SD=9.75). Multiple regression result showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism and narcissism jointly predicted pathological selfies (R=.49; R2=.29; F(6, 293)=15.09; p<.01). However, extraversion (β =.20; t =2.91; p<.05); agreeableness (β= -.29; t =-4.03; p<.01) conscientiousness (β=.24; t=3.90; p<.01); neuroticism (β = .19; t=3.91; p<.05) and narcissism (β=.22; t =3.91; p<.05) had independent significant prediction of pathological selfies.

23,“Quick and dirty”: Intuitive cognitive style predicts trust in Didier Raoult and his hydroxychloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, French public opinion has been divided about Pr. Didier Raoult and his hydroxychloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19. In this paper, our aim is to contribute to the understanding of this polarization of public opinion by investigating the relationship between (analytic vs. intuitive) cognitive style and trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Through three studies (total N after exclusion = 950), we found that a more intuitive cognitive style predicted higher trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Possible mediators included valorization of scientific method over personal experience, belief that truth is political, belief in conspiracy theories and belief in pseudo-medicines. Additionally, we found that higher trust in Didier Raoult and hydroxychloroquine was linked to higher pseudo-medical and conspiratorial beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, but not to self-reported behavior, such as lower compliance with official regulations.",Fuhrer Joffrey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-B2A-5D7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-B2A-5D7,2020-07-08,2020-07-08T20:04:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; covid-19; conspiracy theories; didier raoult; reflection; pseudo-medicines; cognitive style; hydroxychloroquine; intuition,False
24,"“I’m not Working from Home, I’m Living at Work”: Perceived Stress and Work-Related Burnout before and during COVID-19","The purpose of the study was to better understand the relationships among stress, work-related burnout, and remote working brought on by social distancing efforts and stay at home orders put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors developed a questionnaire incorporating valid and reliable self-report stress and burnout measures (Perceived Stress Scale & Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), demographic, and work-related questions. The questions were used primarily to determine workers’ levels of stress before and during the pandemic, to assess potential burnout, and to establish the extent of their previous experience with remote work/telecommuting. The questionnaire was open from March 23rd to May 19th 2020 and distributed through a survey link on social media and by Qualtrics research services. Results from the analyses suggest that perceived stress did increase during the COVID-19 restrictions, especially for people that had limited experience working from home and were female. Individuals who worked from home before COVID-19 had higher levels of work-related burnout but did not differ based on gender or part-time work status. The results suggest that working from home may create more stress and result in more burnout, which challenges the current moves by some employers to make working from home a permanent arrangement. The authors believe that having research based on valid and reliable instruments will help employers and schools make better decisions about how to support those who can remain at home to avoid the potential for secondary outbreaks.",Sherrill Hayes et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-109-58A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-109-58A,2020-07-08,2020-07-08T15:39:12+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Work-life Balance; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Work-life Quality; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; work-related burnout; stress; perceived stress; burnout",False
25,Risk perception and personal responsibility during COVID-19: An experimental study of the role of imperative vs reasoning-based communication for self-isolation attitudes,"Individual decision-making about social distancing, self-quarantine and self-isolation is crucial in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. In the rapidly evolving pandemic, little is known about how different government communication strategies may systematically affect people’s attitudes to staying home or going out, nor the extent to which people perceive and process the risk of different scenarios. In this study, we report results from a sample of 581 participants (residing in the United Kingdom), and we examine the degree to which participants’ attitudes regarding the permissibility of leaving one’s home are (1) sensitive to different levels of risk of viral transmission in specific scenarios, (2) sensitive to communication framings that are either imperative or that invite reasoning about scenarios, or (3) creating “loopholes” for themselves when scenarios are framed with reference to the participants themselves rather than in general terms. We find that participants’ attitudes to social distancing are sensitive to the level of risk of transmission, and that when scenarios are framed in imperative terms, rather than when their reasoning is encouraged, participants have more impermissive attitudes to going out in Minimal Risk scenarios, with a trend of decreased permissiveness more generally; for self-loopholes, more research is needed to determine if participants make exceptions for themselves. Thus, subject to the limitations of this study, during phases where it is important to promote self-isolation for all scenarios, including those perceived to be low risk, imperative communication may be best.",Simon Thomas Van Baal et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FF-088-542,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FF-088-542,2020-07-08,2020-07-08T14:35:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; covid-19; public health communication; imperatives; reasoning; loopholes; social distancing; personal responsibility; risk perception,False
26,Persecutory ideation and anomalous perceptual experiences in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in France: what's left one month later?,"Aims: Beyond the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the public's health, the length of lockdown and its possible psychological impacts on populations around the world is heavily debated. However, the consequences of lockdown on psychotic symptoms have not yet been investigated. Methods: An online survey was run from April 13 to May 11, 2020; a total of 728 French subjects from the general population participated. We assessed the perceived impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, length of self-isolation, diagnosis/symptoms/hospitalisation related to the COVID-19 (oneself and family). Paranoid ideations and anomalous perceptual perceptions were assessed via the Paranoia Scale and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale. Measures of negative affect, loneliness, sleep difficulties, jumping to conclusion bias, emotion regulation, and perseverative thinking were also included. Results: Final regression model for paranoia indicated that socio-demographic variables, loneliness, cognitive bias, anxiety, repetitive thoughts and hallucinations were associated with paranoia (R2 = 0.43). For hallucinations, clinical variables as well as the quality of sleep, behavioural activation, repetitive thoughts, and paranoia were associated with hallucinations in our sample (R2 = 0.27). Neither length of self-isolation nor the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with psychotic experiences in the final models. Conclusions: No evidence was found between a significant impact of self-isolation on psychotic symptoms in the general population in France one month after the lockdown. It nevertheless confirms the preeminent role of several factors previously described in the maintenance and development of psychotic symptoms in the context of a pandemic and lockdown measures.",Catherine Bortolon et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-F93-7AA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-F93-7AA,2020-06-26,2020-07-07T18:02:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology,False
27,Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population.

28,‘Distancers’ and ‘non-distancers’? The potential social-psychological impact of moralising COVID-19 mitigating practices on sustained behaviour change,"COVID-19 mitigating practices such as “hand-washing”, “social distancing” or “social isolating” are constructed as ‘moral imperatives’, required to avert harm to oneself and others. Adherence to COVID-19 mitigating practices is presently high among the general public, and stringent lockdown measures supported by legal and policy intervention has facilitated this. In the coming months, however, as rules are being relaxed and individuals become less strict, and thus the ambiguity in policy increases, the maintenance of recommended social distancing norms will rely on more informal social-interactional processes. We argue that the moralisation of these practices, twinned with relaxations of policy, may likely cause interactional tension between those individuals who do vs. those who do not uphold social distancing in the coming months: i.e., derogation of those who adhere strictly to COVID-19 mitigating practices and group polarisation between ‘distancers’ and ‘non-distancers’. In this paper we explore how and why these processes might come to pass, their impact on an overall societal response to COVID-19, and the need to factor such processes into decisions regarding how to lift restrictions.",Annayah Miranda Beatrice Prosser et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-27F-DAF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-27F-DAF,2020-06-15,2020-07-07T17:59:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intergroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; shaming; social distancing; behaviour change; practices; social identities; social policy; moralisation; covid-19; covidiots; mask wearing,False
29,Resilience During Uncertainty. Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue,"Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to people’s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people’s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals’ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry—both general and COVID-19 specific—and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worries—respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.",Jonas P.

30,"Knowledge, attitudes, and perception susceptibility towards the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin American region","BACKGROUND: Latin American countries have been strongly affected by COVID-19. Due to the alarming prevalence of cases, we set out to explore which psychosocial elements may be exerting an influence on the poor compliance with mandatory control measures among the population. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and susceptibility perception of Latin American population during the coronavirus outbreak. METHOD: We collected data from 600 self-selected participants through a web-based cross-sectional survey evaluating demographic information. The respondents were between 16 to 77 years old. The majority of the participants were female (n= 382), graduated professionals (56.8 %), citizens living in any country in South America (72.2%). RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that knowledge is highly related with age (p=0.010*), attitude is related with marital status (p=0.017*), perception susceptibility is related with education (p=0.049*), marital status (p=0.001**) and occupation (p=0.001**). Our study identified that, although people reported adequate knowledge by identifying expected symptoms and coronavirus transmission process. There is a significant perceived susceptibility to contracting the mentioning virus (57.7%), displaying stigmatized behavior (59.1%), fear of contracting the virus from others (70.2%), and concern regarding serious consequences after the COVID-19 disease (72.3%). Additionally, we found that people distrust National Health administration's response (61.57%), preparedness for the disease (73.8%), and suggesting insufficient measures to deal with COVID-19 disease (61.3%). CONCLUSION: Within the framework of government regulations, it is suggested that guidelines be considered to expand strategies and provide reliable knowledge to facilitate positive attitudes towards protection measures against COVID-19. Communication strategies would serve both to contain psychological reactions and the perception of risk of contagion, as well as educational actions to ensure compliance with public control measures among the population.",Jonathan Zegarra-Valdivia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F3C-660,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F3C-660,2020-06-10,2020-07-07T17:58:54+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; public health; health communication; knowledge; attitudes; perception; primary prevention; covid-19,False
31,"Warriors, worriers, and COVID-19: an exploratory study of the catechol O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism across populations","Background: Prevalence and mortality rates during COVID-19 pandemic have varied widely across nations. This phenomenon may be partly due to regional variations in health-related behaviours, some of which may be influenced by health anxiety. A functional polymorphism of the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, designated rs4680 or Val158Met, has been associated with anxiety-related behaviours and the so-called “worrier” phenotype. Methods: In this exploratory study, an analysis of the correlation between the frequencies of the Met allele of the COMT gene across 28 countries, obtained from the public domain Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED), and the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates in these countries, obtained from the Johns Hopkins Medical University web-based dashboard, was carried out while controlling for population size and median age in each country. Results: Allele frequencies varied widely across populations. Met allele frequency was positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence (ρ = 0.527, p = 0.004) and mortality rate (ρ = 0.542) across nations. However, this association was no longer significant after controlling for confounders. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that there may be a relationship between the COMT rs4680 functional polymorphism and the impact of COVID-19 across nations, which could plausibly be mediated by maladaptive anxiety-related behaviours.",Ravi Philip Rajkumar,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46107-33C-31F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46107-33C-31F,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T13:36:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; covid-19; comt gene; genetics; health anxiety,False
32,"The Contagion Fear and Threat Scale: Measuring COVID-19 Fear in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and scale validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was developed rapidly to capture COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The 10-item scale was administered to 164 Australian, 111 Indian, and 147 Nepali university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 5-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were largely reflected in the Indian student sample but substantially different in the Nepali student sample. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear, and Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and locus of control. Psychometric variance of the CFTS between the three samples are considered in terms of demographic, sociocultural, and linguistic differences.",Francesca Eileen Collins,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T19:21:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; australian; university students; mental health; covid-19; contagion-related fear; scale validation; covid-19-related fear; nepali; fear; indian,False

Methods: Data were collected as part of the “Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey” —a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666; Mage 21·3) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Data were collected on social isolation, COVID-19-related worries/anxieties, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as the current use of and attitude towards digital interventions. Outcomes: Social isolation, lack of company, worrying, and objective social risk indicators were associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dose-response relationships were found. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of reported social isolation increased (with reporting ‘never’ as reference group: ‘very rarely’: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·4,CI 1·0 – 5·7, p=0·041; ‘rarely’: aOR 3·6, CI 1·7 – 7·7, p=0·001; ‘occasionally’: aOR 8·4, CI 4·0 – 17·5, p<0·001; ‘often’: aOR 20·6, CI 9·3 – 45·7, p<0·001;’very often’: aOR 43·4, CI 14·7 – 128·2, p<0·001). There was evidence that psychological distress, and high levels of social isolation, lack of company, and worrying were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas only severe levels of psychological distress and worries were associated with actual use (aOR 2·0, CI 1·3 - 3·0, p=0·001; aOR 1·6, CI 1·1 – 2·2, p=0·005, respectively). Interpretation: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with social isolation and poor mental health outcomes in youth. Digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact without risk for viral infection given there is an objective need and subjective demand.",Christian Rauschenberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395,2020-06-29,2020-07-06T09:38:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; social isolation; public mental health; youth mental health; mhealth; social risk; worrying; covid-19,False
34,How does stress affect our life satisfaction during COVID-19 pandemic? Moderated mediation analysis of sense of coherence and fear of coronavirus,"COVID-19 is a significant threat to human life and health, which makes people experience fear, stress, anxiety and mood disorders, which have a negative impact on their psychological well-being. One of the resources that makes people manage stress better is a sense of coherence, which also has a positive impact on quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between fear of COVID-19, stress, a sense of coherence, and life satisfaction during the coronavirus pandemic. 907 Polish people (522 women and 385 men) participated in this study. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FOC-6), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used in the study. It was verified that the relationship between stress and life satisfaction was mediated by sense of coherence. The relationship between stress and sense of coherence was moderated by fear of COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 acted as a buffer in the relationship between stress and a sense of coherence - it weakened the impact of stress on the sense of coherence. This study is the first to verify the proposed model of moderated mediation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analyses were performed on a very large sample. This manuscript draws attention to the important role of fear of COVID-19 and the sense of coherence in our functioning. The sense of coherence can, by effectively managing stress and reducing the level of anxiety, affect subjective well-being.",Joanna Dymecka et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-1BD-8D4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-1BD-8D4,2020-06-25,2020-07-06T07:41:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; fear of coronavirus; stress; sense of coherence; covid-19; life satisfaction,False
35,Digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review,"Background: Digital interventions may be used to mitigate psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence-based recommendations are lacking. The aim of this rapid meta-review was to investigate the theoretical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention of, and treatment for mental disorder). Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: We identified 813 reviews of which 82 met inclusion criteria. Overall, there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on long-term clinical effects, process quality, and cost-effectiveness is very limited. Interpretation: Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. Decision-makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs in times of quarantine and social distancing.",Christian Rauschenberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-08E-865,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-08E-865,2020-06-29,2020-07-04T22:47:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; intervention; ehealth; digital psychiatry; telemedicine; mhealth; covid-19; prevention; mental health promotion,False
36,Social Distancing Around the Globe: Cultural Correlates of Reduced Mobility,"Background: While the United States has struggled to keep the spread of COVID-19 at bay, many other countries have significantly stunted the number of new cases. Recent evidence suggests that cultural factors may play a key role in the spread of infection. To examine the cultural values underlying adherence to social distancing, this study used global cultural data as well as mobility scores from Google LLC’s global measurement on mobility. Methods: A composite variable for country-level engagement in social distancing was created from February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020 (N = 14,022) across 118 countries. Segmented piece-wise multilevel modeling was used to examine the influence of cultural values of uncertainty avoidance, individualism-collectivism, tightness-looseness, and societal level of trust in three distinct time frames: 1) from February 15, 2020 to the country’s 100th COVID-19 case, 2) the first 30 days after each country’s 100th COVID-19 case, and 3) from the 31st day after the 100th case to June 7, 2020. Results: Results showed that collectivism promoted quick mobilization of social distancing behaviors while uncertainty avoidance stunted this mobilization. After the 100th case of COVID-19, high societal level of trust was related to the decline of social distancing behaviors. Interaction effects showed that countries high on uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and tightness were all quicker to engage in social distancing at the earliest stages of the pandemic but not at the later stages. Conclusion: With the imminent second wave of COVID-19, policy makers and health scholars may explore the efficacy of culture-specific policies, strategies, and social interventions in mobilizing social distancing measures.",Hohjin Im et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CE-C97-EFB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CE-C97-EFB,2020-06-27,2020-07-04T22:40:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; uncertainty avoidance; individualism-collectivism; social distancing; covid-19; trust; tightness-looseness,False
37,Coronavirus and other pathogens: Reflecting on the relationship between health psychology and infectious disease,"I think it is fair to say that the broad focus of health psychology in the UK is on non-communicable disease and lifestyle-related health behaviours. I would like to suggest that perhaps the discipline could devote a little more time to infectious diseases, and not just because we find ourselves in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. In this reflective piece, I outline some of the assumptions that I held, that I sought to challenge in Stage 1 students, and that I suspect are relatively implicit across health psychology as a discipline.",Sarah Elizabeth Golding,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B5-DC2-8DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B5-DC2-8DD,2020-07-04,2020-07-04T09:41:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; health inequalities; infectious disease; health psychology; covid-19,False
38,Socioeconomic Impacts of the COVID-19 Lockdown on the Mental Health and Life Satisfaction of the Japanese Population,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global challenge ever since its emergence, with reports suggesting negative effects of the pandemic on the mental health and well-being of people worldwide. Thus, in this study, we investigated the associations among the socioeconomic changes driven by the pandemic, mental health, life satisfaction (past, present, and future), and fear of COVID-19 in Japan. In total, 560 Japanese individuals took an online survey that included questions on their self-restraint and changing incomes and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale; and present, past, and future life satisfaction scale. Two structural equation models were constructed, revealing that fear of COVID-19 brought about reduced times outdoors, reduced incomes, negative symptoms, and negative present, future, and past life satisfaction.",Daichi Sugawara et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-5FD-0C2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-5FD-0C2,2020-06-30,2020-07-04T04:25:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; fear of covid-19; psychological well-being; covid-19; life satisfaction,False
39,The Bittersweet Dynamics of Psychological Distress and Relief During New Zealand’s COVID-19 Lockdown Clarify Avoidable Mental Health Burdens,"Research indicates COVID-19 lockdowns elevated psychological distress. Here, we leverage national panel data before and during New Zealand’s COVID-19 lockdown to clarify distress buffers (2018/2020, N = 940). To distinguish lockdown-related distress from natural disasters, we investigate distress dynamics following the Christchurch earthquakes (2011, N = 6,806). During lockdown, there were small increases in hopelessness, restlessness, and nervousness, and substantial increases in worthlessness. A sense of neighbourhood community became decoupled from this distress, which high levels of social belonging and health satisfaction did not prevent. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort fostered by social belonging. By contrast, the Christchurch earthquakes increased all distress indicators and distress buffers performed consistently. We infer that losses of employment and social routines during New Zealand’s lockdown, in a setting of government income and health protections, precipitated bittersweet mental health dynamics. That certain pandemic mental health burdens are avoidable has applied interest.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46002-880-A11,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46002-880-A11,2020-06-26,2020-07-03T15:29:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; wellbeing; social capital; ordinal; worthlessness; employment; lockdown; bayesian; anxiety; routine; kessler-6; buffer,False
40,When Social Interaction Backfires: Frequent Social Interaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period Is Associated with Decreased Well-Being and Higher Panic Buying,"The present research investigated a backfiring effect of social interaction on well-being and general confidence in Western populations during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period led to worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying. Overall, our findings indicated that frequent social interaction under a highly novel and uncertain crisis can induce negative consequences on mental health and behavior.",Hyunji Kim et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-63E-D8A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-63E-D8A,2020-07-03,2020-07-03T10:31:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; well-being; social interaction; panic buying; general confidence level; self-other connectedness; word-of-mouth; covid-19,False
41,How confidence in health care systems affects mobility and compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Trust in the health care system requires being confident that sufficient and appropriate treatments will be provided if needed. The COVID-19 public health crisis is a significant, global, and (mostly) simultaneous test of the behavioral implications arising from this trust. We explore whether populations reporting low levels of confidence in the health care system exhibit a stronger behavioral reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. We track the dynamic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across 38 countries and 621 regions by exploiting a large dataset on human mobility generated between February 15 and June 5, 2020 and a broad range of contextual factors (e.g. deaths or policy implementations). Using a time-dynamic framework we find that societies with low levels of health care confidence initially exhibit a faster response with respect to staying home. However, this reaction plateaus sooner, and after the plateau it declines with greater magnitude than does the response from societies with high health care confidence. On the other hand, regions with higher confidence in the health care system are more likely to reduce mobility once the government mandates that its citizens are not to leave home except for essential trips, compared to those with lower health care system confidence. Regions with high trust in the government but low confidence in the health care system dramatically reduce their mobility, suggesting a correlation for trust in the state with respect to behavioral responses during a crisis.",Ho Fai Chan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46143-53E-7A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46143-53E-7A9,2020-07-03,2020-07-03T08:45:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; trust; covid-19; health behavior; health care,False
42,Reduced social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with antisocial behaviors in an online United States sample,"Antisocial behaviors cause harm, directly or indirectly, to others’ welfare. The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of understanding a specific form of antisociality: behaviors that increase risk of disease transmission. Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a preregistered study using an online U.S. sample we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p=.016, n=117) and standing closer to others while outside (p<.001, n=114). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus. These findings suggest that more antisocial individuals may pose health risks to themselves and their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Katherine O'Connell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-8B3-BC8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-8B3-BC8,2020-06-15,2020-07-02T19:43:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; antisocial; social distancing; adult personality,False
43,Who Bought All the Toilet Paper? Conspiracy Theorists Are More Likely to Stockpile During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s lives. Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling). Supporting this idea, two studies using data from the U.K. (cross-sectional) and the U.S. (longitudinal) show that people who endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories are more likely to engage in stockpiling behaviors in the past as well as in the future.",Max Hui Bai,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,2020-07-02,2020-07-02T01:28:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
44,Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress,"Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents’ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescents’ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables.

45,A Person-Centered Approach to Profiling COVID-Related Experiences in the United States: Preliminary Findings from the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII),"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and communities around the world. Intensive health precautions have created constraints on mobility, work, education, family life, and interpersonal relationships. Preliminary survey studies have reported an increase in the prevalence and severity of psychosocial impairments in the pandemic’s immediate wake. However, the impact of specific pandemic-related experiences and patterns of experiences has not been systematically assessed and studied. The goal of the present study was to develop and conduct a preliminary empirical test of a novel, comprehensive assessment of pandemic-related experiences, the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII), using person-centered latent class analysis (LCA). Aims were to (1) test the hypothesis that LCA would identify unique subgroups based on patterns of negative and positive pandemic-related experiences across personal and social domains, and (2) examine whether identified subgroups would significantly differ on sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of mental health and functioning. Results supported hypotheses, with several unique subgroups identified across domains that were differentiated on sociodemographic characteristics and measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and perceived social support. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This study, combined with future research with the EPII, may serve to inform public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the current pandemic and under similar mass public health crisis circumstances in the future.",Damion Grasso et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707,2020-07-01,2020-07-01T13:38:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19; pandemic; epidemic; mental health,False
46,Change in Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Appraisals and Daily Life Experiences,"Intro: When confronted with major threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people often experience (temporary) decline in well-being. The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying stability and change of well-being in times of threat like the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined change in mental health symptoms and its relationships with appraisals of the pandemic and daily life experiences during the pandemic, including affective states, stress, and mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. In this report, we worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as a total of 7189 observations from the diary phase. Results: Results showed that less fortunate change in mental health symptoms across three weeks was predicted by more negative affect and less mindfulness, specifically less attention to the present moment, in daily life. Furthermore, less fortunate change in mental health symptoms was correlated with change towards less fortunate appraisals of the appraisals. Finally, we showed that more general views of the pandemic (i.e., appraisals) were interrelated to experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. Discussion: These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and they show how experiences in daily life matter for change in well-being",Annette Brose et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B,2020-06-30,2020-07-01T12:36:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; stress; well-being; ambulatory assessment; mindfulness; affect; mental health,False
47,"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores.",Ruth Neill et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF,2020-07-01,2020-07-01T09:57:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; depression; covid-19; anxiety; media consumption,False
48,Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment,"Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.",Mokhlesur Rahman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30T20:05:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
49,Boredom and rule breaking during COVID-19,"State boredom presents a conundrum: When bored, we want to engage with something, but we don’t want whatever is currently available. This is exacerbated when external factors impose restrictions on what we can engage in, which is precisely the scenario we are currently facing during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 924 participants to examine the relation between boredom proneness and responses to social isolation. We provide novel evidence that highly boredom prone people have been more likely to break the rules of social isolation (e.g., fewer hours spent in social isolation, poor adherence to social distancing as evidenced by the increased likelihood of holding a social gathering and coming into proximity with more people than recommended). We further demonstrated that boredom proneness substantially mediates the association between self-control and rule-breaking. These results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical factor to consider when encouraging adherence to social isolation.",James Danckert et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-909-D2E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-909-D2E,2020-06-30,2020-06-30T15:15:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation,False
50,Stress and Parenting during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related disruptions, mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results: Greater COVID-19 related disruptions and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress and child abuse potential. In addition, higher perceived stress is associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related disruptions, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential.

51,Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity,"Background. Previous studies carried out in different countries indicated that young adults experience higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which epidemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. Purpose. The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms, as well as perceived difficulties related to pandemic across four age groups in the Polish population; (ii) which factors and difficulties related to pandemic are predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method. A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The group was a representative sample of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed online: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, Social Support Sale, Scale of Epidemic-Related Difficulties. Results. Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Difficulties in relationships and at home were amongst the strongest predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus were one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18-29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms only in the youngest group. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members were the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, it is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Małgorzata Gambin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-A00-BD9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-A00-BD9,2020-06-29,2020-06-30T14:48:15+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Old Age; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19 outbreak; lockdown; depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; epidemic-related difficulties,False

53,Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings,"COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

54,"Children Coping, Contextual Risk and their Interplay during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Spanish Case","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of millions of people around the globe and some of the unprecedent emerged disruptions, are likely to have been particularly challenging for young children (e.g., school closures, social distancing measures, movement restrictions). Studying the impact of such extraordinary circumstances on their well-being is crucial to identify processes leading to risk and resilience. To better understand how Spanish children have adapted (or fail to) to the stressful disruptions resulting from the pandemic outbreak, we examined the effects of child coping and its interactions with contextual stressors (pandemic and family-related) on child adjustment, incorporating in our analysis a developmental perspective. Data was collected in April 2020, through parent-reports, during the acute phase of the pandemic and, temporarily coinciding with the mandatory national quarantine period imposed by the Spanish Government. A sample of 1,123 Spanish children (50% girls) aged three to 12 (Mage = 7.26; SD = 2.39) participated in the study. Results showed differences in the use of specific strategies by children in different age groups (i.e., 3-6, 7-9 and 10-12-year-olds). Despite the uncontrollable nature of the pandemic-related stressors, child disengagement coping was distinctively associated to negative outcomes (i.e., higher levels of behavioral and emotional difficulties), whereas engagement coping predicted psychosocial adjustment across all age groups. Moreover, interactively with child coping, parent fear of the future and parent dispositional resilience appear as relevant contextual factors to predict both negative and positive outcomes, but their effects seem to be age dependent, suggesting a higher contextual vulnerability for younger children. These findings might have implications for identifying individual and contextual risk and informing potential preventive interventions aimed to reduce the impact of future pandemic outbreaks on children of different ages.",Beatriz Domínguez-Álvarez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46239-F0B-78D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46239-F0B-78D,2020-06-29,2020-06-29T19:44:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; children coping; child adjustment; covid-19; pandemic; parent resilience,False
55,Support and Goal Outcomes during COVID-19,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been stuck indoors with their partners for months. Having a supportive partner is likely to be especially important during this time where access to outside sources of support is limited. Individuals have to continue to work on goals and tasks while dealing with demands caused by the pandemic. The present mixed-methods study aimed to investigate how partner support is associated with goal outcomes during COVID-19. The quantitative participants (n = 200) completed a daily diary for a week and weekly longitudinal reports for a month and 48 participants attended a semi-structured interview. The quantitative results showed that higher relational catalyst support was associated with better goal outcomes; qualitative analyses revealed partners use direct and indirect forms of emotional and instrumental support toward goal pursuit.

56,The Fauci Effect: Public Health Messaging During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"It is urgent to understand how to most effectively communicate public health messages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, the focus has been on how to formulate the message, rather than on who should send it, and particularly little is known about the latter during times of crisis. We report on the effectiveness of different public figures at promoting social distancing in 6 countries severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Across countries and demographic strata, immunology expert Dr. Anthony Fauci achieved the highest level of respondents’ willingness to reshare a call to social distancing, followed by a government spokesperson. Celebrity spokespersons were least effective. The likelihood of message resharing increased with age and when respondents expressed positive sentiments towards the spokesperson.

57,Coping behaviors and psychological disturbances in youth affected by the COVID-19 health crisis,"The COVID-19 epidemic and the quarantine that children in many countries have had to undergo is a stressful situation about which little is known so far. The coping behaviors carried out by children and adolescents to face home confinement can be associated with their emotional welfare. The objectives of this study were: 1) to examine the coping strategies carried out by children and adolescents during the COVID-19 health crisis, 2) to analyze the differences in these behaviors in three countries, and 3) to examine the relationship between different modalities of coping and better adaptation. Participants were 1,480 parents of children aged 3-18 years from three European countries (n Spain = 431, n Italy = 712, and n Portugal = 355). The children’s mean age was 9.15 years (SD = 4.27). Parents completed an online survey providing information on symptoms and coping behaviors observed in their children. The most frequent coping strategies were accepting what is going on (58.9%), collaborating with quarantine social activities (e.g., drawings on the windows, supportive applauses) (35.9%), acting as if nothing is happening (35.5%), highlighting pros of being at home (35.1%), and not seeming worried about what is happening (30.1%). Compared to Italian and Spanish children, Portuguese children used a sense of humor more frequently when parents talked about the situation. Acting as if nothing happened, collaborating with social activities, and seeking comfort from others was more likely in Spanish children than in children from the other countries. Compared to Portuguese and Spanish children, those from Italy seem not worried about what was happening. Overall, an emotional-oriented coping style was directly correlated with a greater presence of anxious symptoms, as well as mood, sleep, behavioral, and cognitive alterations. Task-oriented and avoidance-oriented styles were related to better psychological adaptation, measured as the low presence of psychological symptoms. Results also show that unaffected children or children with a lower level of impact were more likely to use strategies based on a positive focus on the situation. This study provides interesting data on the strategies to be promoted by parents to cope with the COVID-19 health crisis in children.",Mireia Orgilés et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46075-9C5-0E9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46075-9C5-0E9,2020-06-26,2020-06-29T12:21:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; covid-19; quarantine; coping; youth,False
58,Public Attitudes Toward Allocating Scarce Resources During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The general public is subject to triage policies that allocate scarce lifesaving resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the worst public health emergencies in the past 100 years. However, public attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies used during this pandemic are not well understood. Three experiments (preregistered; online samples; N = 1,868; U.S. residents) assessed attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies. The experiments evaluated assessments of utilitarian, egalitarian, prioritarian, and social usefulness principles in conditions arising during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving resource scarcity, resource reallocation, and bias in resource allocation toward at-risk groups, such as the elderly or people of color. We found that participants agreed with utilitarian and prioritarian principles for allocating scarce resources during initial allocation and disagreed with egalitarian and social usefulness principles. However, support for these principles did not extend to resource reallocation between existing patients. Lastly, participants did not agree with utilitarian principles when they disadvantaged at-risk groups, such as people of color and people with disabilities. Abandoning utilitarian principles that disadvantaged people of color in favor of equitable allocation resulted in significantly more agreement with triage policy. Understanding these attitudes can contribute to developing triage policies, increase trust in health systems, and assist them in achieving their goals of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Wesley Buckwalter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E4-665-B91,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E4-665-B91,2020-06-28,2020-06-28T12:32:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination,False
59,Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong,"Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing have been effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health has not been investigated. We conducted an online survey of residents in Hong Kong. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. The result of this online survey indicates a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis-risk. Loneliness, but not social network size, explained 12.0% to 29.2% of variance in these psychiatric symptoms. To mitigate the potential epidemic of mental illness in the near future, there is an urgent need to prepare clinicians, caregivers and stakeholders to focus on loneliness. Although the sociopolitical situation of Hong Kong prior to the pandemic was likely another exacerbating factor, given that sociopolitical unrest and violence are common, global problems that co-exist with the pandemic, the case of Hong Kong may prove to be prescient.",Ivy Tso et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5,2020-06-27,2020-06-27T02:54:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; psychosis; depression; psychosis risk; psychiatry; stress; covid-19; loneliness; social isolation; mental health,False
60,"Awareness, risk perception, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in communities of Tamil Nadu, India","As the health and economic impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) expands globally, growing attention is being paid to low-or lower-middle-income countries due to high population densities, limited access to health-case-service, and existing financial burdens. Yet, literature on the psychological reaction to COVID-19 pandemic in low- or lower-middle-income countries is still limited. In this study, we examined people’s awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, perceived risk of contracting coronavirus, fear in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in behaviors and stress during the lockdown in peri-urban areas in Tamil Nadu India. Field workers conducted rapid phone call surveys (N=2044) in 26 communities from May 20th – 25th 2020. We found that the majority of the residents in our sampled community perceived no (60%) or low (23%) level of risk of personally contracting coronavirus. Common fears were related to both the health and economic impact of the pandemic, including loss of income (62%), inability to travel freely (46%), self might get sick (46%), and food shortage (39%). Residents were well-aware of the common symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever (66%) and dry cough (57%), but only a small proportion (24%) mentioned the asymptomatic features of COVID-19. A considerable proportion reported that they did not increase their practice of preventive behaviors since the lockdown, which included not reducing social gatherings (26%), not increasing social distancing practices (19%), and not inform others of COVID-19 related facts (30%). The majority experienced increased stress about finance (79%) and about the lockdown (51%). Our findings emphasize the need to develop context-adequate education and communication programs aimed to raise vigilance about coronavirus, specifically focused on factors such as its asymptomatic features, and to sustain preventive behaviors.

61,"Changes in Social Connection During COVID-19 Social Distancing: It’s Not (Household) Size That Matters, It’s Who You’re With","In an effort to slow down the transmission of COVID-19, countries around the world implemented social distancing and stay-at-home policies—potentially compelling people to rely more on household members for their sense of closeness and belonging. To understand the conditions under which people felt the most connected, we examined whether changes in overall feelings of social connection varied as a function of household size and household composition. In two pre-registered studies, undergraduates in Canada (NStudy 1 = 548) and adults primarily from the U.S. and U.K. (NStudy 2 = 336) reported on their perceived social connection once before and once during the pandemic. In both studies, living with a romantic partner robustly and uniquely buffered shifts in social connection during the first phases of the pandemic (βStudy 1 = .22, βStudy 2 = .16).

We investigated psychological factors that predict adherence to social distancing guidelines. In a two-part longitudinal study (N = 574), we assessed adherence and its difficulty twice, one week apart. At T1, participants either planned to deal with the difficulties of adherence (planning intervention) or not (control condition). We further measured individual differences in planning, self-control, and boredom. T2 adherence was higher in the planning intervention, when participants intended to use plans. Trait planning was associated with higher T1 and T2 adherence and mitigated negative effects of T1 difficulty. Analogous effects emerged for trait self-control at T1. Trait boredom was associated with higher difficulty at T1 and T2 without directly affecting adherence.

63,Judgments of Businesspeople Who Shake Hands in the Era of COVID-19,"Traditionally, handshaking has conferred benefits for businesspeople—signaling politeness, establishing an intention to cooperate, and promoting deal-making. How might the psychological meaning of handshaking have shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led handshaking to become touted as an imminent threat to public health? Through a highly powered, preregistered study (N = 595), we compared U.S. adults’ perceptions of a businessperson who shakes hands vs. refrains from shaking hands during the era of COVID-19. Participants judged handshakers more negatively than non-handshakers, in terms of both global attitude toward them (d = 2.21) and approval of their job performance (d = 2.66). Mediation analyses suggest that businesspeople were judged negatively for shaking hands principally because doing so made them seem less competent and less moral. Judgments of handshaking were more negative among liberals than conservatives and among women than men. To maximize others’ perceptions of them, it would behoove businesspeople to refrain from shaking hands for the foreseeable future.

65,Loneliness in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional results from The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study,"Objectives: Loneliness is a significant public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Method: Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1963, 18-87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis was used to look at the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. Results: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1963). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67 – 5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), meeting clinical criteria for major depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a great number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. Conclusions: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis. Findings suggest that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritise younger people and those with mental health symptoms. Improving emotion regulation and sleep quality may be optimal initial targets to reduce the impact of COVID-19 regulations on mental health outcomes.",Jenny Groarke et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46147-2B6-22E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46147-2B6-22E,2020-06-24,2020-06-25T12:23:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; public health; mental health; covid-19; prevalence; risk factors; cross-sectional studies; protective factors; loneliness; emotion regulation,False
66,"A daily diary study on adolescents’ mood, concern for others, and giving behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic","Adolescence is a formative phase for social development. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures social contact with peers has been severely limited. In the current three-week daily diary study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and associated social distancing measures on Dutch adolescents’ mood, concern for others, and social behavior. Longitudinal analyses including measures before the pandemic showed that adolescents reported decreased levels of empathic concern, opportunities for prosocial actions, and tension, and increased levels of perspective taking and vigor during the first weeks of lockdown. We also investigated giving towards targets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing novel Dictator Games, and how this was influenced by individual differences in empathy, contributions to society, and opportunities for prosocial actions. Adolescents showed higher levels of giving (i.e., 51 – 78% of the total share) to targets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., doctor in hospital, individuals with COVID-19 or a poor immune system) and close others (a friend) compared to unfamiliar peers. Individuals who showed higher levels of empathic concern, gave more to others, regardless of target. Finally, adolescents who showed higher levels of general contributions to society gave more to an unfamiliar peer and friend, and those who showed higher levels of opportunities for prosocial actions gave more to individuals with a poor immune system and COVID-19. Overall, these results shed new light on adolescence as a crucial period in life for social interactions, and as a phase that is not only characterized by risk factors, but also by resilience and a willingness to meaningfully contribute to others and society.",Suzanne Van De Groep et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-357-28F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-357-28F,2020-06-25,2020-06-25T12:21:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Moral Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; giving; prosocial behavior; adolescence; covid-19; daily diary; empathy; social behavior; longitudinal; mood; pandemic,False
67,"Testing the effects of COVID-19 confinement in Spanish children: The role of parents’ distress, emotional problems and specific parenting","The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a great impact in our society. Because of its rapid spread, many countries, including Spain, were forced to impose drastic measures (i.e., restrictive lockdowns) to guarantee social distancing and isolation. In some countries, like Spain, these measures were particularly restrictive for children, who were forced to stay at home for more than 40 days, suffering a drastic change in their daily routines. The present study aimed to examine the effects of the Spanish confinement derived from the COVID-19 crisis on children and their families, accounting for child’s age. A range of child negative (e.g., conduct problems) and positive outcomes (e.g., routine maintenance) were examined, along with a set of parent-related variables, including resilience, perceived distress, emotional problems, parenting distress and specific parenting practices (e.g., structured or avoidant parenting), which were modeled through Path Analysis to better understand child adjustment. Data was collected in April 2020, through parent-reports, on a sample of 1,123 Spanish children (50% girls) aged three to 12 (Mage = 7.26; SD = 2.39). Results suggested that, according to parents’ information, most children did not show important changes in behavior, although some increase rates were observed for both negative and positive outcomes. Child adjustment was influenced by a chain of effects, derived from parents’ perceived distress and emotional response to the COVID-19 crisis, via parenting distress and specific parenting practices. While parenting distress particularly triggered child negative outcomes, specific parenting practices were more closely related to child positive outcomes. These findings may help to better inform, for potential future outbreaks, effective guidelines and prevention programs aimed at promoting child’s well-being in the family.",Estrella Romero et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46054-5C8-5A7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46054-5C8-5A7,2020-06-24,2020-06-24T20:02:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; psychological impact; covid-19; children; parenting; family,False
68,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Student Mental Health: A Longitudinal Examination of Risk and Protective Factors,"The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to unprecedented changes in daily living. College students may face unique challenges associated with these changes. In the present study, college students (N = 205) completed a battery of questionnaires in April of 2020, after having completed similar measures 8, 5, and 2 months prior as part of a larger study. A repeated measures ANOVA suggested significantly greater depression and anxiety symptom severity during the pandemic than at any other time during the 2019-2020 academic year. Static and modifiable factors associated with psychological distress and controlling for pre-existing psychological distress were examined. Cognitive and behavioral avoidance was the most consistent predictor of psychological distress during the pandemic. Online social engagement and problematic Internet use also conferred greater risk. Women and Latinx participants were more likely to experience elevated distress during the pandemic, even when controlling for distress prior to the pandemic.",Martha Zimmermann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C8-053-EA4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C8-053-EA4,2020-06-17,2020-06-24T17:57:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; college students; covid-19; depression; avoidance; distress; anxiety,False
69,Substitution behaviors among casino gamblers during COVID-19 precipitated casino closures,"Objective. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the closure of licensed casinos throughout North America in Spring 2020. This study sought to examine how gamblers responded to the COVID-19 lockdown, including migration to online gambling, and changes in substance use and use of other technologies. Method. We conducted an online cross-sectional study of US residents. 424 individuals with past three months gambling involvement were surveyed on 9 April 2020. Self-reported changes in online gambling and other addictive behaviors since the onset of COVID-19, problem gambling severity, and readiness to change were measured. Results. Overall, online gambling decreased following the onset of COVID-19 casino closures, t(220)=-2.87, p=0.003, 95%CI [-0.546, -0.101], d=0.193, while alcohol, p<0.001, tobacco, p=0.001, and cannabis use, p=0.01, increased among gamblers. Among gamblers who reported no online gambling involvement prior to COVID-19, 15% reported migrating to online gambling under lockdown. These migrators had higher levels of problem gambling, F=37.7, p<0.001, 𝜂2=0.152, and lower income, F=5.50, p=0.004, 𝜂2=0.025, than gamblers who had never gambled online. Conclusions. The response to COVID-19 is heterogeneous: in the short-term, the majority of gamblers reported reducing their online gambling, but increasing their substance use. A minority of gamblers appear to have substituted casino gambling with online gambling. As these individuals are characterized by problem gambling symptoms and lower income, they may be considered a vulnerable group.",Silas Xuereb et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-658-D16,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-658-D16,2020-06-24,2020-06-24T16:44:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; addiction; substance use; gambling; covid-19; substitution,False
70,The Balcony Party – Mitigation of social isolation during the coronavirus outbreak,"With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing need for assessing the psychological costs of social isolation (SI). We examine whether the balcony party can help people cope better with SI during the COVID-19 outbreak. We examined the psychological effects of SI on persons in Israel and Italy between March 23th, 2020 and April 2th, 2020. A total of 303 quarantined persons responded to a Web-based survey. We found that the effect of balcony parties on the psychological costs of SI is dependent on the level of social isolation. Those who experienced high levels of SI perceived the balcony parties as more beneficial in inducing positive affect and reducing negative affect in comparison to those who experienced low levels of SI. The opposite pattern was observed when individuals were asked about their participation in these parties: individuals with high levels of SI experienced balcony parties as less beneficial than similar pre-outbreak gathering events, while individuals with low levels of social isolation showed an opposite pattern. Finally, for those with high SI, balcony parties did not meet the expectation of creating feelings of communal solidarity. However, a discrepancy between high SI expectations and experience was not found for those with low SI. Our findings demonstrate that the balcony parties are beneficial in reducing the emotional cost of social isolation – but only for those who feel low levels of SI. The fact that individuals with high levels of SI expected more out of these parties suggests the need to develop interventions aimed at optimizing their expectations. As society enters a new period in which the costs of social distancing may be higher, our findings are valuable for understanding the psychological battle that individuals face while in social isolation.",Hila Zahava Gvirts,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616A-895-1E1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616A-895-1E1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24T15:50:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
71,How Does Social Distancing During COVID-19 Affect Negative Moods and Memory?,"In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment, the current best defence against COVID-19 is social distancing—staying at home as much as possible, keeping distance from others, and avoiding large gatherings. Although social distancing maximizes physical health, we know little about its psychological consequences. In this research (N = 374), we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased steadily as social distancing duration increased, at which point (~ 30 days) they began to steadily increase. Subsequent analyses indicated that memory errors were mediated by lonely mood in particular. Thus, short-term social distancing might benefit psychological well-being and memory performance, but extended social distancing has the expected negative impact on mood and memory.",Weiwei Zhang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-2B8-CC1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-2B8-CC1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23T21:23:43+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; negative mood; social distancing; social isolation; false memory; covid-19",False
72,"Depression, Environmental Reward, Coping Motives and Alcohol Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Increases in the incidence of psychological distress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic have been predicted. Environmental reward and self-medication theories suggest that increased distress and greater social/environmental constraints during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to clarify the presence and direction of changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 1127) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in an online survey. The survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes (alcohol use; drinking motives; alcohol demand, and solitary drinking). Outcomes were assessed for two timeframes: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (‘pre-social-distancing’), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (‘post-social-distancing’). Depression severity, coping motives, and frequency of solitary drinking were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Time spent drinking and frequency of binge drinking were greater post-social-distancing compared to pre-social-distancing, whereas typical alcohol quantity/frequency were not significantly different between timeframes. Indices of alcohol demand were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effects of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. Results provide early evidence regarding the relation of psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, results largely converged with predictions from self-medication and environmental reinforcement theories. Future research will be needed to study prospective associations among these outcomes.",Matthew Mcphee et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46035-C14-752,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46035-C14-752,2020-06-23,2020-06-23T20:00:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; sars-cov-2; depression; covid-19; social distancing; alcohol; stress; mental health,False

The role of personality, thinking styles and conspiracy mentality","The study aimed to investigate the role of personality, thinking styles, and conspiracy mentality in health-related behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., recommended health behaviors according to COVID-19 guidelines and engagement in pseudoscientific practices related to COVID-19. Basic personality space was defined by the HEXACO model complemented by Disintegration, which represents psychotic-like experiences and behaviors reconceptualized as a personality trait. Mediation analyses conducted on a convenient sample from the general population recruited via social media or by snowballing (N=417) showed that engagement in pseudoscientific behaviors was predicted by high Disintegration. However, this relationship was entirely mediated by thinking styles, i.e., high experiential and low rational.

74,Development of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9) scale for assessing work-related stress and anxiety in healthcare workers in response to COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had psychological impacts on healthcare workers. However, very few scales are available to specifically assess healthcare workers’ work-related stress and anxiety in response to viral epidemics. This study developed a new rating scale, the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), and validated it among healthcare workers directly affected by COVID-19 in Korea. A total of 1,019 healthcare workers responded through anonymous questionnaires during April 20-30, 2020. Internal consistency of the SAVE-9 was measured through Cronbach’s alpha, and principal component analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine its component structure. It was also compared with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scales. Its most appropriate cut-off point was determined by conducting receiver operating characteristic analysis. The nine-item scale had satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.795). It adopted a two-factor structure: (1) anxiety about viral epidemics and (2) work-related stress associated with viral epidemics (Bartlett’s test of sphericity, p < 0.001; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.85). Correlations between SAVE-9 and the other scales were statistically significant. The cut-off points of the SAVE-9 and its anxiety subcategory were 22 and 15, respectively, compared with a GAD-7 score of 5. The results suggest that the SAVE-9 is a useful, reliable, and valid tool to evaluate stress and anxiety responses in healthcare workers during viral epidemics.",Seockhoon Chung Md et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-6FD-752,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-6FD-752,2020-06-11,2020-06-22T22:13:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; amc save-9 project; save-9,False
75,Stay at Home! When Personality Profiles Influence Psychological Adjustment and Creativity during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"With the COVID-19 outbreak, the population was suddenly forced to “stay at home”. Although research suggests that social isolation affects mental health, reactions may vary depending on individuals. This study aimed to identify personality profiles, and examine whether these profiles were associated with affective and cognitive outcomes. Participants filled in an online questionnaire during the lockdown in France (N = 430). Based on measures of individuals’ preference for solitude, extraversion, emotional stability and openness, a latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: “Affiliation”, “Emotionally Stable Lonely” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely”. Results showed that individuals with an “Emotionally Unstable Lonely” profile expressed higher stress and anxiety, and performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an “Emotionally Stable Lonely” profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a convergent creative thinking task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns.",Estelle Michinov et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,2020-06-22,2020-06-22T13:37:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social isolation; covid-19; creativity; personality profiles; preference for solitude,False
76,Neurocognitive Empowerment for Addiction Treatment (NEAT): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Neurocognitive deficits (NCDs) and associated meta-cognition difficulties associated with chronic substance use often delay the learning and change process necessary for addiction recovery and relapse prevention. However, very few cognitive remediation programs have been developed to target NCDs and meta-cognition for substance users. The study described herein aims to investigate the efficacy of a multi-component neurocognitive rehabilitation and awareness program termed ‘Neurocognitive Empowerment for Addiction Treatment’(NEAT). NEAT is a fully manualized, cartoon-based intervention involving psychoeducation, cognitive practice, and compensatory strategies relevant across 10 major cognitive domains, including aspects of attention, memory, executive functions, and decision-making. Method/design: In a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), 80 female opioid and/or methamphetamine users will be recruited from an addiction recovery program providing an alternative to incarceration for women with substance use related offenses. Eight groups of 9-12 participants will be randomized into NEAT or treatment-as-usual (TAU). NEAT involves 14 90-min sessions, delivered twice weekly. The primary outcome is change in self-reported drug craving from before to after intervention using obsessive compulsive drug use scale. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include additional psychological, neurocognitive and structural and functional neuroimaging measures. Clinical measures will be performed at five time points (pre- and post- intervention, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up); neuroimaging measures will be completed at pre- and post-intervention. Discussion: The present RCT is the first study to examine the efficacy of an adjunctive neurocognitive rehabilitation and awareness program for addiction. Results from this study will provide initial information concerning potential clinical efficacy of the treatment, as well as delineate neural mechanisms potentially targeted by this novel intervention.

77,Formalizing interdisciplinary collaboration in the CogSci community,"Is cognitive science interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary? We contribute to this debate by examining the authorship structure and topic similarity of contributions to the Cognitive Science Society from 2000 to 2019. We compare findings from CogSci to abstracts from the Vision Science Society over the same time frame. Our analysis focuses on graph theoretic features of the co-authorship network—edge density, transitivity, and maximum subgraph size—as well as clustering within the topic space of CogSci contributions. We also combine structural and semantic information with an analysis of homophily. We validate this approach by predicting new collaborations in this year’s CogSci proceedings. Our results suggest that cognitive science has become increasingly interdisciplinary in the last 19 years. More broadly, we argue that a formal quantitative approach which combines structural co-authorship information and semantic topic analysis provides inroads to questions about the level of interdisciplinary collaboration in the cognitive science community.",Lauren A.

This study examined the mediating effect of COVID-19 coping strategies on the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health. Design: Cross-sectional, correlational study. Methods: Participants (70% females) included 4,624 adults (Mage=30.29±10.97 years) collected through online survey. Results: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a one-factor structure for the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, COVID-19 Coping Scale, and General Health Scale which exhibited good internal consistency reliability. Findings showed that COVID-19 anxiety was negatively related with COVID-19 coping and general health. COVID-19 coping had a positive relationship with general health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that COVID-19 coping partially mediated the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health.

79,Source of Information in Times of Health Crisis: Evidence from Turkey During COVID-19,"Aim: Media as a source of information can shape public opinion toward COVID-19 response. Identifying how and where people seek information during COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the source of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors - age, gender, educational attainment, and perceived economic level – on source of information. Subject and Methods: An online survey (n = 4,624) was conducted on the Turkish public during early stages of the COVID-19. Results: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable source of information. Higher age, educational attainment, and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism, and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family, and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and that postgraduates attended informative meeting and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status respectively watched more TV and read more newspapers while people with low socioeconomic status attended less in informative meetings.

80,Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched case-control study,"Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A matched case–control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Results: The prevalence estimates of stress, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among cases (73.7%; 59%; 71.6%, respectively) than among controls (43.3%; 25.6%; 31.1%). Chi-square tests showed significant associations between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of feeling stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals.

81,Economic Evaluations of Mental Health Programs for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Systematic Review,"The United States spent 201 billion dollars on mental health related concerns in 2013, ranking mental illness as the leading cause of disability and the single largest source of economic burden worldwide. With mental health-related treatment costs and economic burden only projected to rise, there is an increasing need for cost-inclusive evaluations of mental health interventions specific to the United States as economic evaluations across countries are not easily comparable. Thus, this systematic, descriptive review characterized the types of interventions, target populations, and the quality of 9 economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of youth mental health services conducted in the United States from 2003 to 2019. Existing evaluations suggest that certain mental health interventions for youth, among the few that have been formally evaluated, may be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. However, the small number and mixed quality of eligible studies highlights a dearth of rigorously conductedeconomic evaluations on this topic, variability in cost and outcome assessment approaches, as well as the homogenous characteristics of interventions evaluated. Greater standardization is needed to increase confidence in these conclusions and generate a body of meaningful, quality research that has the potential to shape evidence-based mental health policy.",Jenna Sung et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801,2020-06-18,2020-06-18T01:25:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy,False
82,The psychological wellbeing of frontline workers in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic: First and second wave findings from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study,"Background: Extant research relating to the psychological impact of infectious respiratory disease epidemics/pandemics suggests that frontline workers are particularly vulnerable. Methods: The current study used data from the first two waves of the United Kingdom (UK) survey of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study to compare frontline workers with the rest of the UK population on prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the first week of ‘lockdown’ (Wave 1) and one month later (Wave 2). Results: Compared to the rest of the population, frontline workers generally, and individual frontline worker groups, had significantly higher prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during both wave 1 and wave 2. While prevalence estimates of depression significantly increased among Local & National Government Workers from Wave 1 (15.4%) to Wave 2 (38.5%), no significant improvement or deterioration in mental health status was recorded for any other frontline worker group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that, beyond other risk factors, food workers were nearly twice as likely as others to screen positive for anxiety, while all frontline worker groups, other than transport workers, were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD (Odds Ratios ranged from 1.74 – 3.43). Finally, while frontline workers, generally, were significantly more likely than the general public to have received mental health advice during the pandemic (26.9% versus 20.3% respectively), this was largely reflective of health and social care workers (37.9%).

83,Daily associations between sleep and physical activity: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The day-to-day variations of sleep and physical activity are associated with various health outcomes in adults, and previous studies suggested a bidirectional association between these behaviors. The daily associations between sleep and physical activity have been examined in observational or interventional contexts. The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep – physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g. inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size. Future studies should examine sleep and physical activity during a longer period and perform additional sophisticated statistical analyses.",Sarah Atoui et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-2BA-AA2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-2BA-AA2,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T20:48:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; intraindividual; insomnia; sleep; ambulatory assessment; daily; physical actvity,False
84,"Increased mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption during the spring of 2020. Many college students were told to leave campus at spring break and to complete the semester remotely. This study evaluates effects of this disruption on student well-being. A sample of 148 students (86.5% female, 49.3% White) completed measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use during the spring 2020 semester at a university in the southeastern U.S. Their results were compared to those of 240 students (87.9% female, 64.2% White) who completed the same measures in the fall 2019 semester. Participants in spring 2020 reported more mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use than did pre-pandemic participants. Worry about COVID-19 was negatively associated with well-being in multiple domains. Additionally, White students reported a greater effect of the pandemic on well-being than did African American students. Young adults appear to be less vulnerable to the most serious medical complications associated with COVID-19 but nonetheless experience psychological effects from the pandemic. Universities and practitioners who work with college students can help young adults manage their symptoms and avoid behaviors like risky alcohol use when confronted with stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Nora Elizabeth Charles,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-CA0-ACA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-CA0-ACA,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T17:30:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; stress; covid-19; depression; coronavirus; young adults; mental health; alcohol,False
85,Neurotic coronavirus generation? The report from the second wave of research on the students from Kraków,"The report presents the results of the second wave of research conducted among the students of the Pedagogical University of Kraków. The research method was an on-line survey (CAWI) on the sample of 1927 respondents. The comparison of responses from both surveys indicates that the change in attitudes and mental condition of the respondents occurred. After almost three months of quarantine the youth is less interested in the pandemic, has lower fear of the coronavirus, evaluates the actions taken by government to combat the pandemic worse. A decrease in satisfaction with their lives and an increase in the symptoms of stress is also observed. Negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are also dominant among youth. The psychological resources were exploited to a relatively small extent. The adaptive reactions remain on a similar level. Among the respondents active combating of the threats and redirecting their attention as well as comforting oneself that it could have been worse are dominant. The respondents reveal the symptoms of burnout with remote education.

86,Further to the left. Stress-induced increase of spatial pseudoneglect during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Background The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the lockdown in Italy, do impact psychological health; yet, less is known about their effect on cognitive functioning. The transactional theory of stress predicts reciprocal influences between perceived stress and cognitive performance. However, the effects of a period of stress due to social isolation on spatial cognition and exploration have been little examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effects and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on spatial cognition tasks, particularly those concerning spatial exploration, and the physiological leftward bias known as pseudoneglect. A right-hemisphere asymmetry for spatial attention processes crucially contributes to pseudoneglect. Other evidence indicates a predominantly right-hemisphere activity in stressful situations. We also analyzed the effects of lockdown on coping strategies, which typically show an opposite pattern of hemispheric asymmetry, favoring the left hemisphere. If so, then pseudoneglect should increase during the lockdown and be negatively correlated with the efficacy of coping strategies. Methods One week before the start of the lockdown due to Covid-19 in Italy (T1), we had collected data from a battery of behavioral tests including tasks of peri-personal spatial cognition. During the quarantine period, from late April to early May 2020 (T2), we repeated the testing sessions with a subgroup of the same participants (47 right-handed students, mean age = 20, SD = 1.33). At both testing sessions, participants performed digitized neuropsychological tests, including a cancellation task, radial arm maze task and Raven’s advanced progressive matrices. Participants also completed a newly developed COVID-19 Student Stress Scale, based on transactional models of stress, and the COPE-NIV to assess coping orientation. Results The tendency to start cancellation from a left-sided item, to explore first a left-sided arm of the maze, and to choose erroneous response items on the left side of the page on Raven’s matrices, increased from T1 to T2. The degree of pseudoneglect increment positively correlated with perceived stress, and negatively correlated with Positive Attitude and Problem-Solving COPE-NIV subscales. Conclusions Lockdown-related stress may have contributed to increase leftward bias during quarantine through a greater activation of the right hemisphere. On the other hand, pseudoneglect was decreased for better coping participants, perhaps as a consequence of a more balanced hemispheric activity in these individuals.",Federica Somma et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-36C-20E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-36C-20E,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T05:37:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Attention,False

The devCCNP started in 2013 and has successfully acquired CCNP-SWU data with three repeated measurements ( the trial stage of devCCNP), and accumulated CCNP-CAS baseline data (the second stage of devCCNP). CCNP-SWU consists of 201 age-sex stratified schoolchildren at enrollment (100 children followed up for 2.5 years at 1.25-year intervals) while CCNP-CAS has been recruiting participants since July 2018, and has collected data from 133 eligible children so far. A T1-weighted MRI and two resting functional MRI scans were acquired across three waves in CCNP-SWU with the same imaging protocols on a Siemens Trio 3T scanner at Southwest University in Chongqing, China. CCNP-SWU obtained longitudinal biophysical, social, behavioral and cognitive data via parent-reported questionnaires, self-reported questionnaires, behavioral assessment, as well as E-Prime computer tasks. Data were collected on the impact of COVID-19 on children’s learning and daily life from 46 children between March and May 2020.

88,Priming reasoning increases intentions to wear a face covering to slow down COVID-19 transmission,"Finding mechanisms to promote the use of face masks is fundamental during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic response, when shelter-in-place rules are relaxed and some segments of the population are allowed to circulate more freely. Here we report three pre-registered studies (total N = 1,920), using an heterogenous sample of people living in the USA, showing that priming people to “rely on their reasoning” rather than to “rely on their emotions” significantly increases their intentions to wear a face covering. Compared to the baseline, priming reasoning promotes intentions to wear a face covering, whereas priming emotion has no significant effect. These findings have theoretical and practical implications. Practically, they offer a simple and scalable intervention to promote intentions to wear a face mask.

89,Compliance in the 1.5 Meter Society: Longitudinal Analysis of Citizens’ Adherence to COVID-19 Mitigation Measures in a Representative Sample in the Netherlands,"In the month of May, the Netherlands moved out of the “intelligent lockdown”, and into the “1.5 meter society”, which aims to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic by means of safe-distance measures. This paper assesses how Dutch citizens have complied with these social distancing measures. It analyses data from two surveys conducted in May (between 8-14 and between 22-26) among nationally representative samples (N = 984 and N = 1021). We find that a combination of factors explain social distancing compliance. On the one hand we see that people are more likely to comply if they have an intrinsic motivation to do so, when they have the capacity to comply, when they have good impulse control, when they think compliance is normal, and when they see a general duty to obey rules generally. The paper also assesses how compliance has changed over time, assessing changes in May as well as how these are different from compliance with lockdown measures in April. During this period, there has been a gradual decline in compliance that coincides with a decline in intrinsic motivations and capacity for compliance, and there has been an increase in opportunities to violate the measures. The paper assesses what these changes may mean for current and future success of Covid-19 mitigation measures.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46160-FEE-A7E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46160-FEE-A7E,2020-06-15,2020-06-16T07:24:51+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; trust in science; deterrence; safe distance measures; 1.5 meter society; compliance; emotions; intelligent lockdown; obligation to obey the law; covid-19; netherlands; social norms; political orientation; public health; procedural justice; social distancing; impulsivity; trust in media",False
90,Well-Being and COVID-19 Anxiety: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study in China,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens human beings’ livelihoods and mental health, which lowers their well-being and gives rise to anxiety. This study examines whether there is a causal relationship between people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Method: 222 participants (54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of well-being and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. Results: The results showed that people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak, decline and trough stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants’ well-being at Time 1 significantly predicted their COVID-19 anxiety at Time 2. However, well-being at Time 2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at Time 3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent well-being. Conclusions: People’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and people’s well-being at the peak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted their subsequent anxiety.

We created a novel, five-minute online educational intervention, leveraging evidence-based cognitive science research, to encourage accurate COVID-19 and flu fatality rate calculations and comparisons. As predicted, adults (N = 1,297) randomly assigned to the intervention were more likely to correctly answer health decision-making problems and were less likely to report WNB errors in their problem-solving strategies relative to control participants. There were no immediate effects of condition on COVID-19 risk perceptions and worry; however, those in the intervention group did exhibit increased perceived risk and worry across 10 days of daily diaries.

92,"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320; 54.6% male; mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.",Jeffrey Wardell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593,2020-06-15,2020-06-16T05:01:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; drinking motives; social distancing; coronavirus; parent; covid-19; drinking alone; stress; income; alcohol problems; alcohol; solitary drinking; coping; depression; social isolation,False

94,Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge).

95,Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain,"The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys carried out in Spain with a time difference of about one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) were also employed to evaluate resilience and social anxiety. There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Low resilience was shown by 40.5% of the respondents, and high social anxiety by 34.8%. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales. On the other hand, daily physical activity was found to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores.

This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD=7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress.

97,Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health during COVID-19: Acceptability and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention,"The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (n = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over one week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%). Participants reported pre- to post-program improvements in secondary control (i.e., the belief that one can control their reactions to objective events; dav=0.36, dz=0.50, p<0.001) and in the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their quality of life (dav=0.22, dz=0.25, p<0.001).

98,Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants were drawn from the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS or Understanding Society), a nationally representative sample of adults in the United Kingdom. Participants were 12,074 men and women with a mean age of 51.6 (range 18-95) who took part in the representative wave 9 (2017–2019) sample of the UKHLS and were followed-up between the 24–30th of April 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Results The percentage of participants experiencing mental health problems (GHQ-12 score ≥3) increased from 23.4% in 2017–2019 to 37.1% in April, 2020. All population subgroups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems. The increase was 9.8% (95% CI [5.4%–14.3%]) greater among those aged 18-34 compared to those aged 50–64, 7.4% (95% CI [4.9%–9.9%]) greater in females compared to males, and 3.6% (95% CI [1.1%–6.1%]) greater amongst those with a degree compared to others. Additional analyses showed that the substantial rise in mental health problems in April, 2020 was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation.

99,"An overview of the context, design and conduct of the first two waves of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study","The C19PRC Study aims to assess the psychological, social, and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, Republic of Ireland, and Spain. This paper describes the the first two waves of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression); as well as the role of (3) psychological factors (e.g. personality, locus of control, resilience) and (4) social and political attitudes (e.g. authoritarianism, social dominance), in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Quota sampling was used to recruit a nationally representative (in terms of age, sex, and household income) sample of adults (N=2025), 1406 of whom were followed-up one month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in terms of economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample.

100,Mood Symptoms Predict COVID-19 Pandemic Distress but not Vice Versa: An 18-Month Longitudinal Study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale and was argued to have negatively impacted the population’s mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess such an assertion. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intoler-ance at two baselines six months apart as well as at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic ex-actly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indi-cated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandem-ic-related distress, but pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity.

101,Preparing for a COVID-19 vaccine: Identifying and psychologically profiling those who are vaccine hesitant or resistant in two general population samples,"Successful delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine may be undermined if populations are not receptive to inoculation as a primary public health strategy for combatting the virus. We gathered nationally representative data from the general adult populations of Ireland (N=1,041) and the United Kingdom (UK; N=2,025) to determine rates of hesitancy and resistance to a future COVID-19 vaccine and to identify and psychologically profile vaccine hesitant/resistant individuals in a way that might aid future public health messaging. Vaccine hesitancy was evident for 26% and 25% of Irish and UK samples, respectively, while vaccine resistance was evident for 9% and 6%, respectively. Vaccine hesitant/resistant respondents in Ireland and the UK differed in relation to a number of sociodemographic, political, and health-related variables, but were similar across a broad array of psychological constructs. In both populations, those who were resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to obtain information about the pandemic from traditional and authoritative sources and had similar levels of mistrust in these sources. The current findings may help public health officials to more effectively target vaccine hesitant and resistant individuals, develop effective communication strategies that take into account their specific psychological dispositions, and leverage dissemination channels that can successfully reach these individuals.",Jamie Murphy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-B9C-60B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-B9C-60B,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:02:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; public health messaging; psychology; covid-19; vaccine,False
102,Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology,"Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the levels of loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic, (b) the risk and resilience factors for loneliness and (c) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10084 respondents was proportionally biased in terms of gender and educational level and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared to those found in other studies during non-pandemic circumstances, loneliness levels were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Loneliness levels were higher than in comparable samples measured during non-pandemic circumstances. Among stable factors and as hypothesized, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with clinically significant effect sizes. Among state risk factors and as hypothesized, more rumination and worry in general was associated with stronger loneliness, showing a clinically significant effect size. Among the coping behaviors explored, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a clinically significant effect size. Loneliness predicted both depression and anxiety with clinically significant effect sizes, when all potential confounders as well as psychiatric diagnosis were controlled. The relationship to depression was more marked. Conclusions: The findings support that loneliness is increased during implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. Singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety. The results of the analysis of risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.",Asle Hoffart et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:02:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; quarantine; physical distancing; isolation; loneliness; epidemiology; risk factors; sars-cov-2; depression; psychopathology; social distancing; covid-19; anxiety,False
103,COVID Feel Good – An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus,"Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflexion. 360° or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships and goals. Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness.",Giuseppe Riva et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:01:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological support; virtual reality; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; self-help; coronavirus; anxiety; positive technology; research protocol; covid-19,False
104,"Coronavirus Stress, Meaningful Living, Optimism, and Depressive Symptoms: A Study of Moderated Mediation Model","In the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to public mental health stress, anxiety, panic, and behavioral disorders. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether meaning in life mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms and whether the mediating effect of meaning in life on depressive symptoms was moderated by optimism. The sample of the study included 475 undergraduate students attending a public university in an urban city of Turkey. They were 69.2% female, ranged in age between 18 and 34 years (M = 20.63, SD = 1.99). Results showed that meaning in life and optimism–pessimism mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. Optimism also mediated the relationship between meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, optimism moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life in the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. These results indicated that the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms can be better understood by meaning in life and optimism.

105,"Meaningful Living, Resilience, Affective Balance, and Psychological Health Problems during COVID-19","The present study sought to investigate the mediating effect of the affective balance and resilience on the association between meaningful living and psychological health problems among Turkish young adults in the context of pandemic. Participants were 359 Turkish young adults, comprising of primarily female (68.2%), and their age ranged between 18 to 43 (age M = 20.67, SD = 3.62). Findings from this study indicated that meaningful living had a positive predictive effect on resilience and positive affect, as well as a negative predicative on psychological health challenges and negative affect. Resilience and affective balance also mediated the effect of meaningful living on psychological health of young adults. These results suggest that resilience and affective balance are important aspects of implementing meaning-based preventions and interventions. Thus, meaning–based prevention and intervention strategies could be designed to not only to improve individuals’ life meaning and purpose but also build up resilience and positive affective experiences to foster their psychological health.",Gökmen Arslan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46120-D72-581,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46120-D72-581,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:01:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; psychological health; resilience; positive psychology; affect; meaningful living,False
106,Wearing face masks strongly confuses counterparts in reading emotions,"Wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Although acceptance of such masks increases in the Western hemisphere, many people feel that social interaction is affected by wearing a mask. In the present experiment, we tested the impact of face masks on the readability of emotions. The participants (N=41, calculated by an a priori power test; random sample; healthy persons of different ages, 18-87 years) assessed the emotional expressions displayed by twelve different faces. Each face was randomly presented with six different expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad) while being fully visible or partly covered by a face mask. Lower accuracy and lower confidence in one’s own assessment of the displayed emotions indicate that emotional reading was strongly irritated by the presence of a mask. We further detected specific confusion patterns, mostly pronounced in the case of misinterpreting disgusted faces as being angry plus assessing many other emotions (e.g. happy, sad and angry) as neutral. We discuss compensatory actions that can keep social interaction effective (e.g. body language, gesture and verbal communication), even when relevant visual information is crucially reduced.",Claus Christian Carbon,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EF-5C4-2FB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EF-5C4-2FB,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:01:04+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; face; covid-19 pandemic; emotion; accuracy; masks; occlusion; confusion; social psychology",False
107,State-level Stay-at-home Orders and Objectively Measured Movement in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: Social distancing has been one of the primary interventions used to slow the spread of COVID-19. State-wide stay-at-home orders received a large degree of attention as a public health intervention to increase social distancing, but relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the extent to which stay-at-home orders affected people’s behavior. Method: This study used GPS-derived movement from 2,858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020 to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. Results: From the first week of March to the first week of April, people in counties within states that enacted stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states that did not enact state-level stay-at-home orders. From the first week of April to the first week of May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place. The magnitude of change in movement associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total change in movement across all counties over the same periods of time in both cases. Conclusions: Stay-at-home orders are likely insufficient to reduce people’s movement outside the home without additional public health actions. Existing research on behavior change would be useful to determine what additional interventions could support social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic if becomes necessary to reduce movement in the future.",Kyle J.

The study examined a range of social and behavioural responses by youth from different ethnic backgrounds and across 63 cities (N = 569). More specifically, the study focused on investigating the relationship between threat perceptions, public health behaviours, stress and social cohesion. As expected, results indicate that higher perceptions of threat were related to higher compliance to safety and health measures despite extremely extremely low levels of political trust. Surprisingly, participants reported relatively low levels of stress despite high social isolation and physical restrictions. These results could partially be explained by an increased level of family interactions. Furthermore, participants reported relatively high levels of social cohesion and common-ingroup identification in a usually segregated and conflict-ridden context.",Ana Jankovic et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46122-A88-E8C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46122-A88-E8C,2020-06-10,2020-06-10T06:49:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
109,Gender Differences in Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus,"Social distancing and hygiene practices are key to preventing the spread of Coronavirus. However, people vary in the degree to which they follow these practices. Consistent with previous findings that women adhere more to preventative health practices, in Study 1, women reported engaging in preventative practices regarding COVID-19 (e.g., social distancing, hygiene) more so than men. In Study 2, across three different Northeast U.S. locations, we observed a greater percentage of women wearing masks in public than men. In Study 3, U.S. counties with a greater percentage of women exhibited a higher reduction in movement as tracked by ~17 million GPS smart-phone coordinates. These findings may partly explain the greater infection rates among men and suggest that preventive health messages should be tuned towards men.",Irmak Olcaysoy Okten et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46146-067-E3F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46146-067-E3F,2020-06-10,2020-06-10T00:11:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
110,Somatisation and COVID-19 related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms: The role of hyperarousal,"Objective: Somatisation is commonly associated with histories of trauma and PTSD symptoms. Although previous research has demonstrated that PTSD symptoms predict somatic symptoms, there has been no systematic examination of this at the level of symptom clusters for COVID-19 related PTSD and multi-dimensional assessment of somatic symptoms. It was aimed to test for an association between ICD-11 PTSD symptom clusters, with COVID-19 as the stressor, and somatic symptoms while controlling for potentially confounding variables. Methods: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 1,041 adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland. Physical health problems across the domains of pain, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, and fatigue were assessed by the PHQ and PTSD symptoms were assessed with the ITQ. Descriptive analyses were undertaken and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted controlling for potentially confounding variables. Results: All ICD-11 PTSD symptom clusters predicted the presence of pain, fatigue, gastro-intestinal, and cardiovascular symptoms in the PHQ. Sense of Threat individually predicted all physical health variables, and Avoidance predicted pain. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the key role of sense of threat in the presence of COVID-19 trauma and somatisation.

111,A look at the first quarantined community in the United States: Response of religious communal organizations and implications for public health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The current study examined anxiety and distress among members of the first community to be quarantined in the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to being historically significant, the current sample was unusual in that those quarantined were all members of a Modern Orthodox Jewish community and were connected via religious institutions at which exposure may have occurred. We sought to explore the community and religious factors unique to this sample, as they relate to the psychological and public health impact of quarantine. Community organizations were trusted more than any other source of COVID 19-related information, including federal, state, and other government agencies, including the CDC, WHO and media news sources. This was supported qualitatively with open-ended responses in which participants described the range of supports organized by community organizations. These included tangible needs (i.e. food delivery), social support, virtual religious services, and dissemination of COVID-19 related information. The overall levels of distress and anxiety were elevated and directly associated with what was reported to be largely inadequate and inconsistent health related information received from local departments of health. In addition, the majority of participants felt that perception of or concern about future stigma related to a COVID-19 diagnosis or association of COVID-19 with the Jewish community was high and also significantly predicted distress and anxiety. The current study demonstrates the ways in which religious institutions can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of their constituents. During this unprecedented pandemic, public health authorities have an opportunity to form partnerships with religious institutions in the common interests of promoting health, relaying accurate information and supporting the psychosocial needs of community members, as well as protecting communities against stigma and discrimination.",Sarah L.
